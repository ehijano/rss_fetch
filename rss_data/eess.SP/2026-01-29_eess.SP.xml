      <title>Electromagnetically Consistent Bounds on Information Transfer in Real-World RIS-Parametrized Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) endows a wireless channel with programmability that can be leveraged to optimize wireless information transfer. While many works study algorithms for optimizing such a programmable channel, relatively little is known about fundamental bounds on the achievable information transfer. In particular, non-trivial bounds that are both electromagnetically consistent (e.g., aware of mutual coupling) and in line with realistic hardware constraints (e.g., few-bit-programmable, potentially lossy loads) are missing. Here, based on a rigorous multiport network model of a single-input single-output (SISO) channel parametrized by 1-bit-programmable RIS elements, we apply a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to derive a fundamental bound on the achievable SISO channel gain enhancement. A bound on the maximum achievable rate of information transfer at a given noise level follows directly from Shannon's theorem. We apply our bound to several numerical and experimental examples of different RIS-parametrized radio environments. Compared to electromagnetically consistent benchmark bounding strategies (a norm-inequality bound and, where applicable, a relaxation to an idealized beyond-diagonal load network for which a global solution exists), we consistently observe that our SDR-based bound is notably tighter. We reach at least 64 % (but often 100 %) of our SDR-based bound with standard discrete optimization techniques. The applicability of our bound to concrete experimental systems makes it valuable to inform wireless practitioners, e.g., to evaluate RIS hardware design choices and algorithms to optimize the RIS configuration. Our work contributes to the development of an electromagnetic information theory for RIS-parametrized channels as well as other programmable wave systems such as dynamic metasurface antennas or real-life beyond-diagonal RISs.</description>

      <title>Holographic &amp; Channel-Aware Distributed Detection of a Non-cooperative Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates Distributed Detection (DD) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), where spatially distributed sensors transmit binary decisions over a shared flat-fading channel. To enhance fusion efficiency, a reconfigurable metasurface is positioned in the near-field of a few receive antennas, enabling a holographic architecture that harnesses large-aperture gains with minimal RF hardware. A generalized likelihood ratio test is derived for fixed metasurface settings, and two low-complexity joint design strategies are proposed to optimize both fusion and metasurface configuration. These suboptimal schemes achieve a balance between performance, complexity, and system knowledge. The goal is to ensure reliable detection of a localized phenomenon at the fusion center, under energy-efficient constraints aligned with IoT requirements. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed holographic fusion, even under simplified designs.</description>

      <title>Coverage Performance Analysis of FAS-enhanced LoRa Wide Area Networks under both Co-SF and Inter-SF Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating the coverage performance of the fluid antenna system (FAS)-enhanced LoRa wide-area networks (LoRaWANs). We investigate the effects of large-scale pathloss in LoRaWAN, small-scale fading characterized by FAS, and dense interference (i.e., collision in an ALOHA-based mechanism) arising from randomly deployed end devices (EDs). Both co-spreading factor (co-SF) interference (with the same SF) and inter-SF interference (with different SFs) are introduced into the network, and their differences in physical characteristics are also considered in the analysis. Additionally, simple yet accurate statistical approximations of the FAS channel envelope and power are derived using the extreme-value theorem. Based on the approximated channel expression, the theoretical coverage probability of the proposed FAS-enhanced LoRaWAN is derived. Numerical results validate our analytical approximations by exhibiting close agreement with the exact correlation model. Notably, it is revealed that a FAS with a normalized aperture of 1 times 1 can greatly enhance network performance, in terms of both ED numbers and coverage range.</description>

      <title>WirelessJEPA: A Multi-Antenna Foundation Model using Spatio-temporal Wireless Latent Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose WirelessJEPA, a novel wireless foundation model (WFM) that uses the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). WirelessJEPA learns general-purpose representations directly from real-world multi-antenna IQ data by predicting latent representations of masked signal regions. This enables multiple diverse downstream tasks without reliance on carefully engineered contrastive augmentations. To adapt JEPA to wireless signals, we introduce a 2D antenna time representation that reshapes multi-antenna IQ streams into structured grids, allowing convolutional processing with block masking and efficient sparse computation over unmasked patches. Building on this representation, we propose novel spatio temporal mask geometries that encode inductive biases across antennas and time. We evaluate WirelessJEPA across six downstream tasks and demonstrate it's robust performance and strong task generalization. Our results establish that JEPA-based learning as a promising direction for building generalizable WFMs.</description>

      <title>User Localization via Active Sensing with Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20501v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework for electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA)-aided user localization with active sensing, where ERAs provide additional electromagnetic reconfigurability to diversify the received measurements and enhance localization informativeness. To balance sensing flexibility and overhead, we adopt a two-timescale design: the digital combiner is updated at each stage, while the ERA patterns are reconfigured at each substage via a spherical-harmonic representation. The proposed mechanism integrates attention-based feature extraction and LSTM-based temporal learning, enabling the system to learn an optimized sensing strategy and progressively refine the UE position estimate from sequential observations. Simulation results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms conventional digital beamforming-only and single-stage sensing baselines in terms of localization accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of ERA-enabled active sensing for user localization in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Vehicular Wireless Positioning -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of connected and autonomous vehicles has driven a growing demand for precise and reliable positioning systems capable of operating in complex environments. Meeting these demands requires an integrated approach that combines multiple positioning technologies, including wireless-based systems, perception-based technologies, and motion-based sensors. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of wireless-based positioning for vehicular applications, with a focus on satellite-based positioning (such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites), cellular-based positioning (5G and beyond), and IEEE-based technologies (including Wi-Fi, ultrawideband (UWB), Bluetooth, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications). First, the survey reviews a wide range of vehicular positioning use cases, outlining their specific performance requirements. Next, it explores the historical development, standardization, and evolution of each wireless positioning technology, providing an in-depth categorization of existing positioning solutions and algorithms, and identifying open challenges and contemporary trends. Finally, the paper examines sensor fusion techniques that integrate these wireless systems with onboard perception and motion sensors to enhance positioning accuracy and resilience in real-world conditions. This survey thus offers a holistic perspective on the historical foundations, current advancements, and future directions of wireless-based positioning for vehicular applications, addressing a critical gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Precoding Design for Multi-User MIMO Joint Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate precoding for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) joint communications and sensing (JCAS) systems, taking into account the potential interference between sensing and communication channels. We derive indicators for the sensing and communication performance, i.e., the detection probability and the communication signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for general input signals. Our results show that the use of the communication signal for sensing can prevent a loss in communication performance if channel interference occurs, while the kurtosis of the transmit alphabet of the communication signal limits the sensing performance. We present simulation results of example setups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) deployment scheme of pinching antenna array is proposed, aiming to enhances the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. To fully realize the potential of 3D deployment, a joint antenna positioning, time allocation and transmit power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum communication rate with the constraints of target sensing rates and system energy. To solve the sum rate maximization problem, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based reinforcement learning (HGRL) algorithm. Simulation results prove that 3D deployment of pinching antenna array outperforms 1D and 2D counterparts in ISAC systems. Moreover, the proposed HGRL algorithm surpasses other baselines in both performance and convergence speed due to the advanced observation construction of the environment.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Segmented Waveguide-Enabled Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) design for segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna array (SWAN) systems is proposed to improve the performance of systems by leveraging the low in-waveguide propagation loss of segmented waveguides. The hybrid segment selection and multiplexing (HSSM) protocol is implemented to provide favorable performance with less hardware cost. To achieve this, a joint transmit beamforming optimization, segment selection, and pinching antenna positioning problem is formulated to maximize the sum communication rate with the constraints of sensing performance. To solve the maximization problem, we propose a segment hysteresis based reinforcement learning (SHRL) algorithm to learn segment selection and pinching antenna positions in different progress to explore better strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed SWAN-ISAC scheme outperforms the other baseline schemes, and 2) the proposed HARL algorithm achieves better performance compared to conventional RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based Three-stage Solution for ISAC Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a general ISAC system where the base station (BS) communicates with multiple users and performs target detection is considered. Then, a sum communication rate maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the constraints of transmit power and the minimum sensing rates of users. To solve this problem, we develop a framework that leverages deep learning algorithms to provide a three-stage solution for ISAC beamforming. The three-stage beamforming optimization solution includes three modules: 1) an unsupervised learning based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract fixed-size latent features while keeping its essential information from the variable channel state information (CSI); 2) a reinforcement learning (RL) based beampattern optimization algorithm is proposed to search the desired beampattern according to the extracted features; 3) a supervised learning based beamforming reconstruction algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the beamforming vector from beampattern given by the RL agent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three-stage solution outperforms the baseline RL algorithm by optimizing the intuitional beampattern rather than beamforming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient user scheduling policy in the massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) system remains a significant challenge in the field of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) due to its high computational complexity, scalability, and Channel State Information (CSI) overhead. This paper proposes a novel Grover's search-inspired Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) framework for mMIMO user scheduling. The QRL agent can explore the exponentially large scheduling space effectively by applying Grover's search to the reinforcement learning process. The model is implemented using our designed quantum-gate-based circuit, which imitates the layered architecture of reinforcement learning, where quantum operations act as policy updates and decision-making units. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves proper convergence and significantly outperforms classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sequential Processing Strategies in Fronthaul Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) network with a daisy-chain fronthaul, the amount of information that each access point (AP) needs to communicate with the next AP in the chain is determined by the location of the AP in the sequential fronthaul. Therefore, we propose two sequential processing strategies to combat the adverse effect of fronthaul compression on the sum of users' spectral efficiency (SE): 1) linearly increasing fronthaul capacity allocation among APs and 2) Two-Path users' signal estimation. The two strategies show superior performance in terms of sum SE compared to the equal fronthaul capacity allocation and Single-Path sequential signal estimation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Pinching Antenna Systems Enabled Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-mode pinching-antenna systems (PASS) framework. Multiple data streams can be transmitted within a single waveguide through multiple guided modes, thus facilitating efficient multi-user communications through the mode-domain multiplexing. A physic model is derived, which reveals the mode-selective power radiation feature of pinching antennas (PAs). A two-mode PASS enabled two-user downlink communication system is investigated. Considering the mode selectivity of PA power radiation, a practical PA grouping scheme is proposed, where each PA group matches with one specific guided mode and mainly radiates its signal sequentially. Depending on whether the guided mode leaks power to unmatched PAs or not, the proposed PA grouping scheme operates in either the non-leakage or weak-leakage regime. Based on this, the baseband beamforming and PA locations are jointly optimized for sum rate maximization, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. 1) A simple two-PA case in non-leakage regime is first considered. To solve the formulated problem, a channel orthogonality based solution is proposed. The channel orthogonality is ensured by large-scale and wavelength-scale equality constraints on PA locations. Thus, the optimal beamforming reduces to maximum-ratio transmission (MRT). Moreover, the optimal PA locations are obtained via a Newton-based one-dimension search algorithm that enforces two-scale PA-location constraints by Newton's method. 2) A general multi-PA case in both non-leakage and weak-leakage regimes is further considered. A low-complexity particle-swarm optimization with zero-forcing beamforming (PSO-ZF) algorithm is developed, thus effectively tackling the high-oscillatory and strong-coupled problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-mode PASS over conventional single-mode PASS and fixed-antenna structures.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Design of Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Software-Defined Radio Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into future wireless communication systems offers promising capabilities in dynamic environment shaping and spectrum efficiency. In this work, we present a consistent implementation of a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) model within the NVIDIA's AI-native framework Sionna for 6G physical layer research. Our implementation allows simulation and learning-based optimization of SIM-assisted communication channels in fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated environments, enabling end-to-end training for cognitive and software-defined radio (SDR) applications. We describe the architecture of the SIM model, including its integration into the TensorFlow-based pipeline, and showcase its use in closed-loop learning scenarios involving adaptive beamforming and dynamic reconfiguration. Benchmarking results are provided for various deployment scenarios, highlighting the model's effectiveness in enabling intelligent control and signal enhancement in non-terrestrial-network (NTN) propagation environments. This work demonstrates a scalable, modular approach for incorporating intelligent metasurfaces into modern AI-accelerated SDR systems and paves the way for future hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Target Localization Using Passive Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive Radar Systems have received tremendous attention during the past few decades, due to their low cost and ability to remain covert during operation. Such systems do not transmit any energy themselves, but rely on a so-called Illuminator-of-Opportunity (IO), for example a commercial TV station. A network of Receiving Nodes (RN) receive the direct signal as well as reflections from possible targets. The RNs transmit information to a Central Node (CN), that performs the final target detection, localization and tracking. A large number of methods and algorithms for target detection and localization have been proposed in the literature. In the present contribution, the focus is on the seminal Extended Cancelation Algorithm (ECA), in which each RN estimates target parameters after canceling interference from the direct-path as well as clutter from unwanted stationary objects. This is done by exploiting a separate Reference Channel (RC), which captures the IO signal without interference apart from receiver noise. We derive the statistical properties of the ECA parameter estimates under the assumption of a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and we give a sufficient condition for the SNR in the RC to enable statistically efficient estimates. The theoretical results are corroborated through computer simulations, which show that the theory agrees well with empirical results above a certain SNR threshold. The results can be used to predict the performance of passive radar systems in given scenarios, which is useful for feasibility studies as well as system design.</description>

      <title>RIR-Mega-Speech: A Reverberant Speech Corpus with Comprehensive Acoustic Metadata and Reproducible Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index ($C_{50}$) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results.
  Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.</description>

      <title>A Learning-based Framework for Spatial Impulse Response Compensation in 3D Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a promising imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical contrast with ultrasound detection. Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Constrained Optimization via Prox-Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies consensus-based decentralized stochastic optimization for minimizing possibly non-convex expected objectives with convex non-smooth regularizers and nonlinear functional inequality constraints. We reformulate the constrained problem using the exact-penalty model and develop two algorithms that require only local stochastic gradients and first-order constraint information. The first method, Decentralized Stochastic Momentum-based Prox-Linear Algorithm (D-SMPL), combines constraint linearization with a prox-linear step, resulting in a linearly constrained quadratic subproblem per iteration. Building on this approach, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) variant, Decentralized SCA Momentum-based Prox-Linear (D-SCAMPL), which handles additional objective structure through strongly convex surrogate subproblems while still allowing infeasible initialization. Both methods incorporate recursive momentum-based gradient estimators and a consensus mechanism requiring only two communication rounds per iteration. Under standard smoothness and regularity assumptions, both algorithms achieve an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, matching the optimal rate known for unconstrained centralized stochastic non-convex optimization. Numerical experiments on energy-optimal ocean trajectory planning corroborate the theory and demonstrate improved performance over existing decentralized baselines.</description>

      <title>RF-MatID: Dataset and Benchmark for Radio Frequency Material Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.</description>

      <title>Vibro-Sense: Robust Vibration-based Impulse Response Localization and Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Hands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich contact perception is crucial for robotic manipulation, yet traditional tactile skins remain expensive and complex to integrate. This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that complex physical contact dynamics can be effectively decoded from simple vibrational signals, offering a viable pathway to widespread, affordable contact perception in robotics. To accelerate research, we provide our full datasets, models, and experimental setups as open-source resources.</description>

      <title>Tilt-based Aberration Estimation in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging but suffer from aberrations caused by lens imperfections and environmental conditions, reducing image quality. These aberrations can be compensated by adjusting electromagnetic lenses, but this requires accurate estimates of the aberration coefficients, which can drift over time. This paper introduces a method for the estimation of aberrations in TEM by leveraging the relationship between an induced electron beam tilt and the resulting image shift. The method uses a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the aberration coefficients from a sequence of image shifts, while accounting for the drift of the aberrations over time. The applied tilt sequence is optimized by minimizing the trace of the predicted error covariance in the KF, which corresponds to the A-optimality criterion in experimental design. We show that this optimization can be performed offline, as the cost criterion is independent of the actual measurements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based, receding-horizon approach with multi-starts. Additionally, we develop an approach to estimate specimen-dependent noise properties using expectation maximization (EM), which are then used to tailor the tilt pattern optimization to the specific specimen being imaged. The proposed method is validated on a real TEM set-up with several optimized tilt patterns. The results show that optimized patterns significantly outperform naive approaches and that the aberration and drift model accurately captures the underlying physical phenomena. In total, the alignment time is reduced from typically several minutes to less than a minute compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Quantitative synthetic aperture radar inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse scattering problem for monostatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR): Estimate the wave speed in a heterogeneous, isotropic and nonmagnetic medium probed by waves emitted and measured by a moving antenna. The forward map, from the wave speed to the measurements, is derived from Maxwell's equations. It is a nonlinear map that accounts for multiple scattering and it is very oscillatory at high frequencies. This makes the standard, nonlinear least squares data fitting formulation of the inverse problem difficult to solve. We introduce an alternative, two-step approach: The first step computes the nonlinear map from the measurements to an approximation of the electric field inside the unknown medium aka, the internal wave. This is done for each antenna location in a non-iterative manner.
  The internal wave fits the data by construction, but it does not solve Maxwell's equations. The second step uses optimization to minimize the discrepancy between the internal wave and the solution of Maxwell's equations, for all antenna locations. The optimization is iterative. The first step defines an imaging function whose computational cost is comparable to that of standard SAR imaging, but it gives a better estimate of the support of targets. Further iterations improve the quantitative estimation of the wave speed. We assess the performance of the method with numerical simulations and compare the results with those of standard inversion.</description>

      <title>SA-PEF: Step-Ahead Partial Error Feedback for Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biased gradient compression with error feedback (EF) reduces communication in federated learning (FL), but under non-IID data, the residual error can decay slowly, causing gradient mismatch and stalled progress in the early rounds. We propose step-ahead partial error feedback (SA-PEF), which integrates step-ahead (SA) correction with partial error feedback (PEF). SA-PEF recovers EF when the step-ahead coefficient $\alpha=0$ and step-ahead EF (SAEF) when $\alpha=1$. For non-convex objectives and $\delta$-contractive compressors, we establish a second-moment bound and a residual recursion that guarantee convergence to stationarity under heterogeneous data and partial client participation. The resulting rates match standard non-convex Fed-SGD guarantees up to constant factors, achieving $O((\eta,\eta_0TR)^{-1})$ convergence to a variance/heterogeneity floor with a fixed inner step size. Our analysis reveals a step-ahead-controlled residual contraction $\rho_r$ that explains the observed acceleration in the early training phase. To balance SAEF's rapid warm-up with EF's long-term stability, we select $\alpha$ near its theory-predicted optimum. Experiments across diverse architectures and datasets show that SA-PEF consistently reaches target accuracy faster than EF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem with applications in climate, energy, healthcare, and finance. Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.</description>

      <title>Constrained and Regularized Quantitative Ultrasound Parameter Estimation using ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularized estimation of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters, such as attenuation and backscatter coefficients, has gained research interest. Recently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been applied successfully to estimate these parameters, by utilizing L2 and L1 norms for attenuation and backscatter coefficient regularization, respectively. While this method improves upon previous approaches, it does not fully leverage the prior knowledge of minimum physically feasible parameter values, sometimes yielding values outside the realistic range. This work addresses this limitation by incorporating minimum QUS parameter values as constraints to enhance ADMM estimation. The proposed method is validated using experimental phantom data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rate-Splitting and Sparse Code Multiple Access (RS-SCMA): Design and Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes, for the first time, a hybrid multiple access framework that integrates the principles of rate-splitting (RS) and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in an SISO downlink scenario. The proposed scheme, termed RS-SCMA, unifies the powerful interference management capability of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with the near-optimal multiuser detection of SCMA. A key feature of RS-SCMA is a tunable splitting factor $\alpha$, which governs the allocation between the generic $M$-ary modulated common messages and SCMA-encoded private messages. This enables dynamic control over the fundamental trade-off between system sum-rate, bit error rate (BER), and the overloading factor. We develop novel transmitter and receiver architectures based on soft successive interference cancellation (SIC), incorporating message passing algorithm (MPA) detection and soft-symbol reconstruction. Furthermore, a unified analytical expression for the achievable sum-rate is derived as a function of the splitting factor $\alpha$. The performance of the proposed RS-SCMA system is evaluated in terms of both BER and sum-rate. Simulation results confirm the superiority of RS-SCMA over conventional SCMA and multi-carrier RSMA, demonstrating its scalability and robustness even in the presence of channel estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Multiuser Beamforming for Holographic MIMO~Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is a potential technique for improving spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining low hardware cost and power consumption. Although conventional alternating optimization (AO) methods are widely adopted for optimizing the digital and holographic beamformers, their high computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. Deep learning provides an alternative with low inference latency, where graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ability to exploit permutation equivariance (PE) properties. In HMIMO systems, the optimal beamforming policy exhibits PE properties across multiple dimensions, which can be leveraged by GNNs. However, designing a single GNN to exploit the PE properties in all dimensions results in large model sizes and substantial training complexity. To address this issue, we first transform the beamforming optimization problem to optimize an equivalent beamformer and the holographic beamformer. Then, we propose a novel network architecture consisting of a gradient-based graph neural network (GGNN) followed by two projection modules, which first learns the equivalent beamformer and holographic beamformer and subsequently recovers the digital beamformer from the equivalent beamformer. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher SE with reduced inference latency than the AO baseline and exhibits superior generalization performance compared with existing learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning for wireless channel state information (CSI)reduces reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering annotation costs, and often improves performance on downstream tasks. However, state-of-the-art approaches take little or no account of domain-specific knowledge, forcing the model to learn well-known concepts solely from data. We introduce Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), a hybrid method based on the concept of compressed sensing for wireless channels. In contrast to existing work, SpaRTran builds around a wireless channel model that constrains the optimization procedure to physically meaningful solutions and induces a strong inductive bias. Compared to the state of the art, SpaRTran cuts positioning error by up to 28% and increases top-1 codebook selection accuracy for beamforming by 26 percentage points. Our results show that capturing the sparse nature of radio propagation as an unsupervised learning objective improves performance for network optimization and radio-localization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam training and prediction in millimeter-wave communications are highly challenging due to fast time-varying channels and sensitivity to blockages and mobility. In this context, infrastructure-mounted cameras can capture rich environmental information that can facilitate beam tracking design. In this work, we develop an efficient attention-enhanced machine learning model for long-term beam tracking built upon convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units to predict both current and future beams from past observed images. The integrated temporal attention mechanism substantially improves its predictive performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves Top-5 beam prediction accuracies exceeding 90% across both current and six future time slots, significantly reducing overhead arising from sensing and processing for beam training. It further attains 97% of state-of-the-art performance with only 3% of the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Blind Source Separation of Radar Signals in Time Domain Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification and further analysis of radar emitters in a contested environment requires detection and separation of incoming signals. If they arrive from the same direction and at similar frequencies, deinterleaving them remains challenging. A solution to overcome this limitation becomes increasingly important with the advancement of emitter capabilities. We propose treating the problem as blind source separation in time domain and apply supervisedly trained neural networks to extract the underlying signals from the received mixture. This allows us to handle highly overlapping and also continuous wave (CW) signals from both radar and communication emitters. We make use of advancements in the field of audio source separation and extend a current state-of-the-art model with the objective of deinterleaving arbitrary radio frequency (RF) signals. Results show, that our approach is capable of separating two unknown waveforms in a given frequency band with a single channel receiver.</description>

      <title>Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals. To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization. Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Spoofing Against Adversary Sensing: CRB-Maximizing Design and Decoying Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the capability of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), when transparently covering a User Equipment (UE), to deceive an adversary monostatic radar system. A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed. Selected numerical results confirm deep nulls at the true reflection AoA together with a pronounced decoy peak, rendering maximum-likelihood sensing at the adversary radar unreliable.</description>

      <title>GPT2MEG: Quantizing MEG for Autoregressive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised objectives are increasingly applied to brain recordings, but autoregressive generation of realistic multichannel neural time series remains comparatively underexplored, particularly for Magnetoencephalography (MEG). We study (i) modified multichannel WaveNet variants and (ii) a GPT-2-style Transformer, autoregressively trained by next-step prediction on unlabelled MEG. For the Transformer, we propose a simple quantization/tokenization and embedding scheme (channel, subject, and task-condition embeddings) that repurposes a language-model architecture for continuous, high-rate multichannel time series and enables conditional simulation of task-evoked activity. Across forecasting, long-horizon generation, and downstream decoding, GPT2MEG more faithfully reproduces temporal, spectral, and task-evoked statistics of real MEG than WaveNet variants and linear autoregressive baselines, and scales to multiple subjects via subject embeddings.

      <title>Mixture of Experts for Decentralized Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale machine learning architectures such as large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless networks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE framework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing resource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across diverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE, including various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI (GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive applications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications, heterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile edge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical layer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and security are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview of open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support diverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future research directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training techniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with emerging 6G technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our work on a novel indoor positioning system (IPS) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) based on radar sensing of local, passive radar reflectors. Through the combination of simple reflectors and a single-channel frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, high positioning accuracy at low system cost can be achieved. Further, a multi-objective (MO) particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented that optimizes the 2D placement of radar reflectors in complex room settings.</description>

      <title>WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.</description>

      <title>WaveSP-Net: Learnable Wavelet-Domain Sparse Prompt Tuning for Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at https://github.com/xxuan-acoustics/WaveSP-Net.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Feature Attribution: Bridging Statistics, Explainable AI, and Topological Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act independently, but it becomes less clear when the predictive model involves interactions, such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients (IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a few examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Per-Channel Energy Normalization Front-end for Robust Audio Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In audio signal processing, learnable front-ends have shown strong performance across diverse tasks by optimizing task-specific representation. However, their parameters remain fixed once trained, lacking flexibility during inference and limiting robustness under dynamic complex acoustic environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive paradigm for audio front-ends that replaces static parameterization with a closed-loop neural controller. Specifically, we simplify the learnable front-end LEAF architecture and integrate a neural controller for adaptive representation via dynamically tuning Per-Channel Energy Normalization. The neural controller leverages both the current and the buffered past subband energies to enable input-dependent adaptation during inference. Experimental results on multiple audio classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive front-end consistently outperforms prior fixed and learnable front-ends under both clean and complex acoustic conditions. These results highlight neural adaptability as a promising direction for the next generation of audio front-ends.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>
