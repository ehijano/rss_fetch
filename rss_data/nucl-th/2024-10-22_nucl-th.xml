      <title>Regulator-independent equations of state for neutron stars generated from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equation of state (EoS) of a neutron star (NS) accounting for new advances. In the low energy density, $n\leq 0.1 n_s$, with $n_s$ the saturation density, we use a new pure neutron matter EoS that is regulator independent and expressed directly in terms of experimental nucleon-nucleon scattering data. In the highest-density domain our EoS's are matched with pQCD to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. First principles of causality, thermodynamic consistency and stability are invoked to transit between these two extreme density regimes. The EoS's are further constrained by the new measurements from PREX-II and CREX on the symmetry energy ($S_0$) and its slope ($L$). In addition, we also take into consideration the recent experimental measurements of masses and radii of different NSs and tidal deformabilities. A band of allowed EoS's is then obtained. Interestingly, the resulting values within the band for $S_0$ and $L$ are restricted with remarkably narrower intervals than the input values, with $32.9\leq S_0 \leq 39.5~\text{MeV}$ and $ 37.3 \leq L\leq 69.0~\text{MeV}$ at the 68\% CL. The band of EoS's constructed also allows possible phase transitions (PTs) for NS masses above 2.1~$M_\odot$ at 68\% CL for $n&gt;2.5n_s$. We find both long and short coexistence regions during the PT, corresponding to first and second order PTs, respectively. We also generate the band of EoS's when excluding the astrophysical observables. This is of interest to test General Relativity and modified theories of gravity. Our band of EoS's for NSs can be also used to study other NS properties and dark matter capture in NS.</description>

      <title>Pair momentum dependence of tilted source in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the particle-emitting source can be tilted away from the beam direction, an effect that becomes particularly significant at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This phenomenon, manifest itself in many observables such as directed flow, polarization, and vorticity, is therefore important to investigate. In this paper, we study the consistency between the tilt extracted directly from the freeze-out distribution of pions and the tilt parameter obtained using the azimuthally sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT) method. Using the UrQMD model, we demonstrate a strong dependence of the tilt parameter extracted with asHBT on the momentum of the particle pair. Considering the experimental challenges in accessing low particle momenta - where the tilt parameter extracted with asHBT closely matches the tilt of the freeze-out distribution of pions - we propose an exponential extrapolation method to obtain the tilt of the entire freeze-out distribution. This approach aims to enhance the accuracy of experimental measurements of tilt in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Second-order Spin Hydrodynamics: A Kubo-Type Formulation for the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive a relativistic canonical second-order spin hydrodynamics for two power-counting schemes. We obtain comprehensive second-order expressions for dissipative fluxes, including the shear stress tensor, bulk viscous pressure, charge-diffusion currents, rotational stress tensor, boost heat vector, and spin tensor-related dissipative flux. By introducing novel transport coefficients and expressing them in terms of equilibrium correlation functions, we establish new Kubo-type formulas for second-order transport. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the collective spin dynamics of strongly interacting matter and provide a robust theoretical basis for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Magic Nuclei: Ground-State Properties, Bubble Structure and {\alpha}-Decay Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of superheavy nuclei in the isotopic chains of proton numbers Z=106, 114, 120, and 126 together with isotonic chains of neutron numbers N=162, 172, and 184 is presented in the theoretical framework of relativistic mean-field density functionals based on density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings. Ground-state properties, including binding energy, shape, deformation, density profile, and radius, are estimated to provide compelling evidence of magicity in these even-even nuclei, aligning with the concept of the 'island of stability'. The analysis reveals central depletion in the charge density, indicating a bubble-like structure, primarily attributed to the substantial repulsive Coulomb field and the influence of higher l-states. A thorough examination of potential decay modes, employing various semi-empirical formulas, is presented. The probable alpha-decay chains are evaluated, demonstrating excellent agreement with available experimental data</description>

      <title>Test of $T$-invariance in scattering of polarized protons on tensor-polarized deuterons at energies of the NICA SPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of violation of $T$-invariance, provided that $P$-parity is preserved, is given by the total cross section of the interaction of a vector-polarized particle with a tensor-polarized target. A formalism for calculating this effect developed previously and based on the spin-dependent Glauber theory of elastic $pd$ scattering is used here to calculate the effect under discussion in the range of collision energies corresponding to the invariant mass of the $pN$ system $\sqrt{s_{pN}}=5$--$30$ GeV. The spin-dependent amplitudes of elastic $pN$ scattering required for this calculation are taken from existing phenomenological models for $pN$ scattering in the energy region considered.</description>

      <title>Shell quenching in nuclear charge radii based on Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge radii can be generally used to encode the information about various fine structures of finite nuclei. In this work, a constructed Bayesian neural network based on Monte Carlo dropout approach is proposed to accurately describe the charge radii of nuclei with proton number $Z\geq 20$ and mass number $A\geq 40$. More motivated underlying mechanisms are incorporated into this combined model except for the basic building blocks with the specific proton and neutron numbers, which naturally contains the pairing effect, isospin effect, shell closure effect associated to the Casten factor $P$, valence neutrons, valence protons, quadrupole deformation $\beta_{20}$, high order hexadecapole deformation $\beta_{40}$, and the local ``abnormal" shape staggering effect of $^{181,183,185}$Hg. To avoid the over-fitting puzzle along $Z=28$, $50$, and $82$ isotopic chains, the modified Casten factor $P^{*}$ is tentatively introduced into the input structure parameter sets. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of the Monte Carlo dropout Bayesian neural network (MC-dropout BNN) model to significantly increase the accuracy in predicting the nuclear charge radii. The standard root-mean-square deviation falls into $0.0084$ fm for the training data and $0.0124$ fm for the validation data with the modified Casten factor $P^{*}$ input. Meanwhile, the shell closure effect of nuclear charge radii can be reproduced remarkably well.</description>

      <title>The nuclear symmetry energy and the neutron skin thickness in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate possible correlations between the stiffness of the symmetry energy at saturation density, the so-called $L$ parameter, and the neutron skin thickness of ${^{48}}$Ca and ${^{208}}$Pb, for which the recent measurements from the CREX and PREX I+II experiments at the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory became available. We choose an ensemble of nucleonic equations of state (EoS) derived within microscopic (BHF, Variational, AFDMC) and phenomenological (Skyrme, RMF, DD-RMF) approaches. They are all compatible with the laboratory nuclear collisions data and with current observations of neutron stars (NS) mass and the tidal polarizability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ NS, as deduced from the GW170817 event. We find some degree of correlation between the $L$ parameter and the neutron skin thickness whereas a much weaker correlation does exist with the tidal polarizability and the symmetry energy at saturation density. However, some EoS which are able to explain the CREX experimental data, are not compatible with the PREX I+II data, and viceversa. We confirm the results previously obtained with a different set of EoS models, and find a possible tension between the experimental data and the current understanding of the nuclear EoS.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarkonium-nuclear bound states within a generalized linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the binding energies of charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\psi(1D)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, $\chi_{c2}$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon_2(1D)$, $\chi_{b0}$, $\chi_{b1}$, $\chi_{b2}$) states bound in various nuclei (${\rm{^{4}He}}$, ${\rm{^{12}C}}$, ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$) using the quarkonia-nuclei potentials obtained from their mass shifts in nuclear matter within the generalized linear sigma model. In the absence of light partons in heavy quarkonia, at the tree level, the medium modifications are driven by the gluon condensate, which is simulated within this model through a scalar dilaton field, $\chi$, by introducing broken scale invariance of QCD. Our study shows that charmonium states bind more deeply with the atomic nuclei as compared to bottomonium states, providing a better probe for nuclear medium effects. Such bound states' investigations are particularly interesting for the upcoming J-PARC-E29, $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$@FAIR, and CEBAF@JLab experiments. The mass shifts of the heavy quarkonium states in hot isospin asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated and are observed to receive an appreciable medium modification. These medium effects are anticipated at FAIR@GSI, where such neutron-rich hot nuclear matter is expected to be produced.</description>

      <title>Quark mass effects in octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities via lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark mass dependence of octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities is examined at the level of individual quark-sector contributions in the uniform background-field approach of lattice QCD. The aim is to understand the direct impact of increasing the mass of a quark flavour on the magnetic polarisability and indirect or environmental effects associated with changing the mass of spectator quarks, insensitive to the background magnetic field. Noting the need to set the electric charge of some quark flavours to zero, a fractionally charged baryon formalism is introduced. We find that increasing the mass of the charged quark flavour directly causes its contribution to the magnetic polarisability to decrease. However, increasing the mass of the spectator quark flavour indirectly acts to increase the magnetic polarisability. To gain a deeper understanding of these effects, we evaluate the predictions of the constituent quark model in this context. While the model provides a compelling explanation for the environmental effect of varying the spectator quark mass, an explanation of the direct mass dependence is more complicated as competing factors combine in the final result. The lattice results indicate the key factor is a reduction in the constituent quark magnetic moment with increasing quark mass, as it governs the strength of the magnetic transition to the nearby decuplet baryon.</description>

      <title>Probing the onset of hydrodynamization in peripheral p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV LHC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we attempt to estimate the minimum size of the de-confined matter of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in a small system that could be satisfactorily modeled with low-order hydrodynamics. The elliptic flow coefficient has been studied for the variation of the second-order transport coefficient, called the shear relaxation time, which acts as a regulator of the non-hydrodynamic mode of theory. For this, we chose the small system of p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV and simulated it on the JETSCAPE framework. We modeled the soft sector dynamics using an initial condition, a pre-equilibrium stage, hydrodynamics, and a hadron afterburner. We generated results of transverse momentum spectra and rapidity spectra of light particles to match the simulated system with the experimental data. We looked at elliptic flow fluctuations for extreme values of shear relaxation time for peripheral collision centralities, whose increase indicates breakdown of fluid behavior at around $dN/dy \approx 8$ for p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV LHC energy.</description>

      <title>Kaons and antikaons in isospin asymmetric dense resonance matter at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the in-medium properties of kaons and antikaons in isospin asymmetric hot and dense resonance matter within the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model. Along with nucleons and hyperons, the interactions of $K$ and $\bar K$ mesons with all decuplet baryons ($\Delta^{++,+,0,-}, \Sigma^{*\pm,0},\Xi^{*0,-}, \Omega^{-}$) are explicitly considered in the dispersion relations. The properties of mesons in the chiral SU(3) model are modified at finite density and temperature of asymmetric resonance matter through the exchange of scalar fields $\sigma, \zeta$ and $\delta$ and the vector fields $\omega, \rho$ and $\phi$. The presence of resonance baryons in the medium at finite temperature is observed to modify significantly the effective masses of $K$ and $\bar{K}$ mesons. We also calculated the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons as a function of momentum in resonance matter. The present study of in-medium masses and optical potentials of kaons and antikaons will be important for understanding the experimental observables from the heavy-ion collision experiments where hot and dense matter may be produced. Our results indicate that when resonance baryons are present within the medium at finite baryonic density, the mass reduction of kaons and antikaons becomes more pronounced as the temperature of the medium increases from zero to 100 and 150 MeV. The study of the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons reveals a stronger correlation with strangeness fraction compared to isospin asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point from first principles through contours of constant entropy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>The study of hadronic rescattering on $K^{*0}$ resonance yield in baryon-rich QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of hadronic rescattering on $K^{*0}$ resonance yield can be studied by measuring $K^{*0}/K$ ratio as a function of centrality or multiplicity. This study investigates how the size of the system and the chemical composition (meson-meson versus meson-baryon interaction) of the matter formed in heavy-ion collisions impact the process of hadronic rescattering. It is shown that existing calculation of $K^{*0}/K$ ratio, which considers the interaction of $K^{*0}$ and $K$ mesons with only light mesons in the hadronic medium (neglecting interactions with baryons), fails to explain the measured $K^{*0}/K$ ratio at RHIC BES energies. To understand the multiplicity dependence of the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio at RHIC BES and SPS energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $&lt;$ 20 GeV), the Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed. UrQMD calculations suggest that for a given multiplicity, $K^{*0}/K$ is more suppressed in Au+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =7.7 GeV, compared to that in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV. This is possibly because of formation different type of QCD medium at 200 GeV and 7.7 GeV, and change in interaction cross-section between hadrons with change in particle type and energy.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars as a dense liquid drop at equilibrium within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The macroscopic model is formulated for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium. We use
  the leptodermic approximation $a/R\ll 1$, where $a$ is the crust thickness of the effective NS surface (ES), and $R$ is the mean radius
  of the ES curvature. Within the approximate Schwarzschild metric solution to the general relativity theory equations for the spherically
  symmetric systems, the macroscopic gravitation is taken into account in terms of the total separation particle energy and incompressibility.
  Density distribution $\rho$ across the ES in the normal direction to the ES was obtained analytically for a general form of the energy density
  $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$. For the typical crust thickness, and effective radius, one finds the leading expression for the density $\rho$. NS masses
  are analytically calculated as a sum of the volume and surface terms, taking into account the radial curvature of the metric space, in reasonable
  agreement with the recently measured masses for several neutron stars. We derive the simple macroscopic equation of state (EoS) with the surface
  correction. The analytical and numerical solutions to Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the pressure are in good agreement with the volume
  part of our EoS.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of an $N$-Component Gas Mixture using the Chapman--Enskog Method under Anisotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytical Chapman-Enskog formula for calculating the shear viscosity $\eta$ of a relativistic ideal gas, such as a massless quark-gluon plasma, has consistently demonstrated good agreement with the numerical results obtained using the Green-Kubo relation under both isotropic and anisotropic two-body scatterings. However, past analyses of massless, multicomponent quark-gluon plasma have focused on an effective single-component "gluon gas." The Chapman-Enskog formula for multicomponent mixtures with nonzero yet adjustable masses was previously developed for simpler cases of isotropic scatterings. This study aims to obtain the Chapman-Enskog shear viscosity formula for a massless, multicomponent mixture under general anisotropic scatterings. Since the shear viscosity depends on a linearized collision kernel, an approximation formula for the linearized collision kernel is derived under elastic and anisotropic $l+k\rightarrow l+k$ scatterings. This derived approximation agrees very well with the isotropic two-body kernels provided in previous works for both like and different species. Furthermore, for multicomponent mixtures beyond two species types, an alternative expansion method of the $N$-component Chapman-Enskog viscosity is presented. This is applied to a two-component "binary" mixture and compared with the conventional formula for binary viscosity. The agreement between the two, for interacting and noninteracting binary mixtures, varies from moderate to well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faddeev calculations of low-energy $\Lambda$-deuteron elastic scattering are performed up to $E_{cm}=20$ MeV across the deuteron threshold. Phase shifts of the $s$-wave with $J=1/2$ and $J=3/2$ are calculated using strangeness $S=-1$ hyperon-nucleon interactions in chiral effective field theory NLO13 and NLO19 parametrized by the J{\"u}lich-Bonn group. Effective range parameters, such as a scattering length and an effective range, are determined through the calculated phase shifts. $\Lambda$-deuteron momentum correlation functions are evaluated using the $\Lambda$-deuteron relative wave function constructed from half-off-shell $t$-matrices. They are compared with those evaluated using an approximate formula.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Collider-Produced QCD Matter I: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the ``modified'' $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory for collider-produced QGP. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures relevant for collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generator Coordinate Method: eGCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generator coordinate method (GCM) was introduced in nuclear physics by Wheeler and his collaborators in 1950's and it is still one of the mostly used approximations for treating nuclear large amplitude collective motion (LACM). GCM was inspired by similar methods introduced in molecular and condensed matter physics in the late 1920's, after the Schr\"odinger equation became the tool of choice to describe quantum phenomena. The interest in the 1983 extension of GCM suggested by Reinhard, Cusson and Goeke, which includes internal excitations, was revived in recent years, but unfortunately this new time-dependent GCM (TDGCM) framework has a serious flaw, which prevents it from describing correctly many anticipated features in a properly formulated TDGCM framework, such as interference and entanglement. I present here an alternative formulation, the enhanced GCM (eGCM), which is free of difficulties encountered in previous TDGCM implementations and relevant for fission and many-nucleon transfer in heavy-ion reactions.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>On Two Nucleons Near Unitarity with Perturbative Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the expansion of two-nucleon S-wave scattering phase shifts and pole parameters about Unitarity in Chiral Effective Field Theory with Perturbative Pions at N2LO: the only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO adds scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); N2LO adds once-iterated OPE. We take advantage of the high degree of symmetry of the nontrivial fixed point at Unitarity, where Physics is universal and invariant under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. Both are explicitly but weakly broken in the Unitarity Expansion, including by OPE. This version applies in the Unitarity Window (45deg&lt;delta(k)&lt;135deg), including around k=mpi. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k&gt;100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. In the resulting $\chi$EFT with Perturbative Pions in the Unitarity Expansion, both channels describe PWAs and empirical pole parameters well within several mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k&gt;mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}$=300MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore hypothesise: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence, i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO. We also speculate that this may resolve a conflict with the strength of the tensor interaction in the large-Nc expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the impact parameter dependence of the background field's effect on the coupling constant of the $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-} \gamma$ process in heavy-ion collisions. The peripheral electric fields of heavy ions collide, and after photon annihilation into lepton pairs, the subsequent emission of radiation photons will be affected by the background field. Numerical estimates indicate that the dependence of this effect on the impact parameter is significant during this process.</description>

      <title>The $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ pentaquark and its partners in the molecular picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has detected a new hidden-charm pentaquark with the quantum numbers of a $\Lambda$ baryon: the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$. This pentaquark will be interpreted as a $\bar{D}_s \Lambda_c$-$\bar{D} \Xi_c$ resonance within a contact-range theory. Here we briefly comment on the relation of the new $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ with the $P^{\Lambda}_{\psi s}(4459)$. We find that the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ and $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ both accept a common description in terms of the same parameters, which predicts the existence of a few additional $P_{\psi}^N$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}$ and $P_{\psi s s}^{\Xi}$ molecular pentaquarks composed of a charmed antimeson and an antitriplet charmed baryon. The most robust of these predicted pentaquarks is a $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$ with a mass in the $(4235-4255)\,{\rm MeV}$ range, while other two interesting ones are a $P_{\psi}^{N}(4150)$ and a $P_{\psi}^{\Sigma}(4335)$, the latter basically at the same mass as the $P_{\psi}^{\Lambda}(4338)$, with which it might mix owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the $P_c(4457)^+$ as the $P_{\psi}^{\Delta^+}(4457)$ isoquartet $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the $P_{c}(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ pentaquarks is a fascinating theoretical question. Within the molecular picture their more usual interpretation is that of $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound states. Here we argue in favor of interpreting the $P_c(4457)$ pentaquark as a $I=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound state (with spin $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$) instead. Owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects, with this identification the partial decay width of the $P_c(4457)^+$ into $J/\psi p$ will be of the same order of magnitude as the $P_{c}(4312)^+$ and $P_c(4440)^+$, in contrast with the considerably larger partial decay width in the $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ scenario. In turn, this leads to a different hidden-charm molecular pentaquark spectrum, in which there are only four or five $P_{\psi}^N$ bound states instead of the usual seven, which might explain why the predicted $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{3}{2}$ ($I=\tfrac{1}{2}$) $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ molecular partners of the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)$ have not been observed.</description>

      <title>Heavy- and light-flavor symmetry partners of the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$, the $X(3872)$ and the $X(3960)$ from light-meson exchange saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the charmed meson-(anti)meson system is a fundamental tool for disentangling the nature of a few exotic hadrons, including the recently discovered $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ tetraquark, the $X(3960)$, or the $X(3872)$, the nature of which is still not clear after almost two decades of its discovery. Here we consider that the charmed meson-(anti)meson short-range interaction is described by the exchange of light-mesons ($\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). The effects of light-meson exchanges are recast into a simple contact-range theory by means of a saturation procedure, resulting in a compact description of the two-hadron interaction. From this, if the $T_{cc}^+$ were to be an isoscalar $D^* D$ molecule, then there should exist an isoscalar $J=1$ $D^* D^*$ partner, as constrained by heavy-quark spin symmetry. Yet, within our model, the most attractive two charmed meson configurations are the isovector $J=0$ $D^* D^*$ molecule and its sextet $D_s^* D^*$ and $D_s^* D_s^*$ flavor partners. Finally, we find a tension between the molecular descriptions of the $T_{cc}^+$ and that of the $X(3872)$ and $X(3960)$, where most parameter choices suggest that if the $T_{cc}^+$ is purely molecular then the $X(3872)$ overbinds (or conversely, if the $X(3872)$ is a molecule the $T_{cc}^+$ does not bind). This might be consequential for determining the nature of these states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the $c qq$ baryons contains a few states whose nature is not clearly a three-quark composite and which might have a sizable baryon-meson component. Examples include the $\Sigma_c(2800)$ or the $\Lambda_c(2940)$. Here we explore the spectrum of two-body systems composed of a light, octet baryon and a charmed meson (or antimeson) within a simple contact-range theory in which the couplings are saturated by light-meson exchanges. This results in the prediction of a series of composite anticharmed pentaquarks ($\bar{c} q qqq $) and singly-charmed baryons ($c \bar{q} qqq $). Among the later we find $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\Xi D$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\Xi D^*$ bound states with masses matching those of the recently observed $\Omega_c(3185)$ and $\Omega_c(3327)$ baryons.</description>

      <title>Candidate toroidal electric dipole mode in the spherical nucleus $^{58}$Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dipole toroidal modes appear in many fields of physics. In nuclei, such a mode was predicted more than 50 years ago, but clear experimental evidence was lacking so far. Using a combination of high-resolution inelastic scattering experiments with photons, electrons and protons, we identify for the first time candidates for toroidal dipole excitations in the nucleus $^{58}$Ni and demonstrate that transverse electron scattering form factors represent a relevant experimental observable to prove their nature.</description>

      <title>Causal fermion states in magnetic field in a relativistic rotating frame and electromagnetic radiation by a rapidly rotating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Two-gluon one-photon vertex in a magnetic field and its explicit one-loop approximation in the intermediate field strength regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the general structure for the two-gluon one-photon vertex in the presence of a constant magnetic field. We show that, when accounting for the symmetries satisfied by the strong and electromagnetic interactions under parity, charge conjugation and gluon interchange, and for gluons and photons on mass-shell, there exist only three possible tensor structures that span the vertex. These correspond to external products of the polarization vectors for each of the particles in the vertex. We also explicitly compute the one-loop approximation to this vertex in the intermediate field strength regime, which is the most appropriate one to describe possible effects of the presence of a magnetic field to enhance photon emission during pre-equilibrium in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the most favored direction for the photon to propagate is in the plane transverse to the field, which is consistent with a positive contribution to $\nu_2$ and may help to understand the larger than expected elliptic flow coefficient measured in this kind of reactions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting,we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. This application to the timelike region assumes an approximation based on unitarity and analyticity that is valid only in the large $q^2$ region. Using the recent data from BESIII we establish the regime of validity of this approximation. We report here that our results for the effective form factor (combination of $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$) are in good agreement with the data already for $q^2$ values above 15 GeV$^2$. In addition, a more conservative onset of the validity of the approximation is provided by the newly available $|G_E/G_M|$ data which suggest that our predictions may be compared against data for $q^2 \ge $ 20 GeV$^2$. This is expected in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Stars and quark stars in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model.</description>
