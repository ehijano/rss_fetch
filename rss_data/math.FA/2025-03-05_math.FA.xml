      <title>Algebras of analytic functionals and homological epimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proved by the author [arXiv: 2404.19433] that the Arens-Michael envelope of a solvable Lie algebra is a homological epimorphism. We show here that for algebras of analytic functionals on a connected complex Lie group the analogous statement is satisfied without the assumption of solvability, and furthermore the completion homomorphisms of a more general form are also homological epimorphisms, including the envelope with respect to the class of Banach PI-algebras.</description>

      <title>Derivations and Sobolev functions on extended metric-measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order differential calculus over extended metric-topological measure spaces. The latter are quartets $\mathbb X=(X,\tau,{\sf d},\mathfrak m)$, given by an extended metric space $(X,{\sf d})$ together with a weaker topology $\tau$ (satisfying suitable compatibility conditions) and a finite Radon measure $\mathfrak m$ on $(X,\tau)$. The class of extended metric-topological measure spaces encompasses all metric measure spaces and many infinite-dimensional metric-measure structures, such as abstract Wiener spaces. In this framework, we study the following classes of objects:
  - The Banach algebra ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$ of bounded $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions on $X$.
  - Several notions of Lipschitz derivations on $X$, defined in duality with ${\rm Lip}_b(X,\tau,{\sf d})$.
  - The metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$, defined in duality with Lipschitz derivations on $X$.
  Inter alia, we generalise both Weaver's and Di Marino's theories of Lipschitz derivations to the extended setting, and we discuss their connections. We also introduce a Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$ via an integration-by-parts formula, along the lines of Di Marino's notion of Sobolev space, and we prove its equivalence with other approaches, studied in the extended setting by Ambrosio, Erbar and Savar\'{e}. En route, we obtain some results of independent interest, among which are:
  - A Lipschitz-constant-preserving extension result for $\tau$-continuous ${\sf d}$-Lipschitz functions.
  - A novel and rather robust strategy for proving the equivalence of Sobolev-type spaces defined via an integration-by-parts formula and those obtained with a relaxation procedure.
  - A new description of an isometric predual of the metric Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\mathbb X)$.</description>

      <title>Strengthening of spectral radius, numerical radius, and Berezin radius inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{H}_n$ are arbitrary complex Hilbert spaces, and ${\bf A}=[A_{ij}]$ is an $n\times n$ operator matrix with $A_{ij}\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_j, \mathcal{H}_i).$ We show that $w({\bf A}) \leq w\left(\begin{bmatrix}
  a_{ij}
  \end{bmatrix}_{i,j=1}^n \right),$ where $w(\cdot)$ denotes the numerical radius and the entries $$ a_{ij}=\begin{cases}
  w(A_{ii}) &amp; \textit{if $i=j$},
  \sqrt{ \left( \|A_{ij}\|+\|A_{ji}\| \right)^2- \left(\|A_{ij}\| \|A_{ji}\|-w(A_{ji}A_{ij}) \right)}^{} &amp; \textit{if $i&lt;j$},
  0 &amp; \textit{if $i&gt;j$.} \end{cases}$$ This bound improves $w({\bf A}) \leq w\left(\begin{bmatrix}
  a'_{ij}
  \end{bmatrix}_{i,j=1}^n \right),$ where $a'_{ij}=w(A_{ii})$ if $i=j$ and $a'_{ij}=\|A_{ij}\|$ if $i\neq j$.
  We deduce an upper bound for the Kronecker products $A\otimes B$, where $A\in \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $B\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_1)$, which refines Holbrook's classical bound $w(A\otimes B)\leq w(A)\|B\|$, when all entries of $A$ are non-negative. Further, we obtain the Berezin radius inequalities for $n\times n$ operator matrices where the entries are reproducing kernel Hilbert space operators. We provide an example, which illustrates these inequalities for some concrete operators on the Hardy--Hilbert space. Applying the numerical radius bounds, we show that if $A_i \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_i, \mathcal{H}_1) $ and $B_i\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_i)$ for $i=1,2,$ then
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  r(A_1B_1+A_2B_2) \leq \frac{ 1 }{2 } \left(w(B_1A_1)+w(B_2A_2) \right)
  + \frac{ 1 }{2 } \sqrt{ \left(w(B_1A_1)-w(B_2A_2)\right)^2 + 3\|B_1A_2\|\|B_2A_1\| + \eta},
  \end{eqnarray*} where $\eta=w(B_2A_1 B_1A_2)$, and $r(\cdot)$ denotes the spectral radius. We also achieve a bound for the roots of an algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic regularity in the discrete log-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chain rule lies at the heart of the powerful Gamma calculus for Markov diffusions on manifolds, providing remarkable connections between several fundamental notions such as Bakry-\'Emery curvature, entropy decay, and hypercontractivity. For Markov chains on finite state spaces, approximate versions of this chain rule have recently been put forward, with an extra cost that depends on the log-Lipschitz regularity of the considered observable. Motivated by those findings, we here investigate the regularity of extremizers in the discrete log-Sobolev inequality. Specifically, we show that their log-Lipschitz constant is bounded by a universal multiple of $\log d$, where $d$ denotes the inverse of the smallest non-zero transition probability. As a consequence, we deduce that the log-Sobolev constant of any reversible Markov chain on a finite state space is at least a universal multiple of $\kappa/\log d$, where $\kappa$ is the Bakry-\'Emery curvature. This is a sharp discrete analogue of what is perhaps the most emblematic application of the Bakry-\'Emery theory for diffusions. We also obtain a very simple proof of the main result in \cite{MR4620718}, which asserts that the log-Sobolev constant and its modified version agree up to a $\log d$ factor. Our work consolidates the role of the sparsity parameter $\log d$ as a universal cost for transferring results from Markov diffusions to discrete chains.</description>

      <title>Zero-one law of orbital limit points for weighted shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.01641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chan and Seceleanu have shown that if a weighted shift operator on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, admits an orbit with a non-zero limit point then it is hypercyclic. We present a new proof of this result that allows to extend it to very general sequence spaces. In a similar vein we show that, in many sequence spaces, a weighted shift with a non-zero weakly sequentially recurrent vector has a dense set of such vectors; but an example on $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$ shows that such an operator is not necessarily hypercyclic. On the other hand, we obtain that weakly sequentially hypercyclic weighted shifts are hypercyclic. Chan and Seceleanu have moreover shown that if an adjoint multiplication operator on a Bergman space admits an orbit with a non-zero limit point then it is hypercyclic. We extend this result to very general spaces of analytic functions, including the Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>The lattice structure of negative Sobolev and extrapolation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\mathbb R^d)$ are vector lattices with respect to the pointwise almost everywhere order if $k \in \{0,1\}$, but not if $k \ge 2$. In this note, we consider negative $k$ and show that the span of the positive cone in $W^{k,p}(\mathbb R^d)$ is a vector lattice in this case.
  We also prove a related abstract result: if $(T(t))_{t \in [0,\infty)}$ is a positive $C_0$-semigroup on a Banach lattice $X$ with order continuous norm, then the span of the cone $X_{-1,+}$ in the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$ is a vector lattice. This complements results obtained by B\'atkai, Jacob, Wintermayr, and Voigt in the context of perturbation theory and provides additional context for the theory of infinite-dimensional positive systems.</description>

      <title>Differentiating a Linear Recursive Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of real-valued functions of a real variable given by a homogeneous linear recursion with differentiable coefficients. We show that if the functions in the sequence are differentiable, then the sequence of derivatives also satisfies a homogeneous linear recursion whose order is at most double the order of original recursion. Similarly to the well-known operations that determine the elementwise sum and product of two linear recursive sequences, the coefficient functions of our recursion for the derivatives are easily computable from the original coefficient functions and their derivatives by direct manipulation of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the recursion, without determining the roots. A simple application, computing linear recursions for derivatives of orthogonal polynomials, is presented.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal function and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal operator defined as \begin{align*} \mathcal{M}^{\#} _\beta f(x) := \sup_{Q} \inf_{c \in \mathbb{R}} \chi_{Q}(x) \frac{1}{\ell(Q)^\beta} \int_Q |f-c| \; d \mathcal{H}^{\beta}_\infty, \end{align*} where the supremum is taken over all cubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with sides pararell to the coordinate axes, $\ell(Q)$ is the length side of $Q$ and $\mathcal{H}^{\beta}_\infty$ is the Hausdorff content. In particular, we prove Fefferman-Stein inequality for $\mathcal{M}^{\#} _\beta f$ by giving a good lambda estimate for $\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal operator in the context of Hausdorff content. Additionally, we prove the Muckenhoupt-Wheeden inequality in this framework by establishing a good lambda inequality of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable groupoid with a fixed Haar system $\lambda=\{\lambda^{u}\}_{u\in G^{0}}$ and $(\Phi,\Psi)$ be a complementary pair of $N$-functions satisfying $\Delta_{2}$-condition. In this article, we introduce the continuous field of Orlicz space $(L^{\Phi}_{0},\Delta_{1})$ and provide a sufficient condition for the space of continuous sections vanishing at infinity, denoted $E^{\Phi}_{0}$, to be an Banach algebra under a suitable convolution. Further, the condition for a closed $C_{b}(G^{0})$-submodule $I$ of $E^{\Phi}_{0}$ to be a left ideal is established. Moreover, we provide a groupoid analogue of the characterization of the space of convolutors of Morse-Transue space for locally compact groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper aims to understand separability and entanglement in tensor cones, in the sense of Namioka and Phelps, that arise from the base cones of operator system tensor products. Of particular interest here are the Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems, which are, respectively, operator systems of Toeplitz matrices and Laurent polynomials of bounded degree (that is, trigonometric polynomials), and which are related in the operator system category through duality. Some additional categorical relationships established in this paper for Toeplitz and Fej\'er-Riesz operator systems. Of independent interest is a single matrix criterion, similar to the criterion involving the Choi matrix, for a linear map of the Fej\'er-Riesz operator system to be completely positive.</description>

      <title>A Pontryagin Maximum Principle for agent-based models with convex state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a first order optimality condition for a class of agent-based systems, as well as for their mean-field counterpart. A relevant difficulty of our analysis is that the state equation is formulated on possibly infinite-dimensional convex subsets of Banach spaces. This is a typical feature of many problems in multi-population dynamics, where a convex set of probability measures may account for the population, the degree of influence or the strategy attached to each agent. Due to the lack of a linear structure and of local compactness, the usual tools of needle variations and linearisation procedures used to derive Pontryagin type conditions have to be generalised to the setting at hand. This is done by considering suitable notions of differentials and by a careful inspection of the underlying functional structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that an inclusion of an algebra $A$ into a $C^*$-algebra $B$ has the ideal separation property if closed ideals in $B$ can be recovered by their intersection with $A$. Such inclusions have attractive properties from the point of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish several permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G) \subseteq C^*_{\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>On $p$-fractional weakly-coupled system with critical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following nonlocal system of equations: \begin{align}\tag{$\mathcal S$}\label{MAT1} (-\Delta_p)^s u = \frac{\alpha}{p_s^*}|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}+f(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \, (-\Delta_p)^s v = \frac{\beta}{p_s^*}|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}+g(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d},\, u,v &gt;0 \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \end{align} where $s\in(0,1)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$, $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha,\beta&gt;1$, $\alpha+\beta=dp/(d-sp)$, and $f,\, g$ are nonnegative functionals in the dual space of $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. When $f=g=0$, we prove a uniqueness result for the ground state solution of \eqref{MAT1}. On the other hand, when $f \not \equiv 0, g \not \equiv 0$, the primary objective is to present a global compactness result that offers a complete characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional associated with \eqref{MAT1}. Using this characterization, within a certain range of $s$, we establish the existence of a solution with negative energy for \eqref{MAT1} when $\ker(f)=\ker(g)$.</description>

      <title>Real operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C$^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>
