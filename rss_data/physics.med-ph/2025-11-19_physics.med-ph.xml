      <title>Contactless Monitoring of Muscle Vibrations During Exercise with a Chaos-Inspired Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to enable quantitative feedback on muscle fatigue during exercise to optimize exercise effectiveness while minimizing injury risk. We seek to capture fatigue by monitoring surface vibrations that muscle exertion induces. Muscle vibrations are unique as they arise from the asynchronous firing of motor units, producing surface micro-displacements that are broadband, nonlinear, and seemingly stochastic. Accurately sensing these noise-like signals requires new algorithmic strategies that can uncover their underlying structure. We present GigaFlex the first contactless system that measures muscle vibrations using mmWave radar to infer muscle force and detect fatigue. GigaFlex draws on algorithmic foundations from Chaos theory to model the deterministic patterns of muscle vibrations and extend them to the radar domain. Specifically, we design a radar processing architecture that systematically infuses principles from Chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics throughout the sensing pipeline, spanning localization, segmentation, and learning, to estimate muscle forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing exercises. Across a 23-participant study, GigaFlex estimates maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.9\%, and detects one to three Repetitions in Reserve (RIR), a key quantitative muscle fatigue metric, with an AUC of 0.83 to 0.86, performing comparably to a contact-based IMU baseline. Our system can enable timely feedback that can help prevent fatigue-induced injury, and opens new opportunities for physiological sensing of complex, non-periodic biosignals.</description>

      <title>Enabling Real-Time Volumetric Imaging in Interventional Radiology Suits via a Deep Learning Framework Robust to C-arm Tilt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary interventional imaging lacks the real-time 3D guidance needed for the precise localization of mobile thoracic targets. While Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) provides 3D data, it is often too slow for dynamic motion tracking. Deep learning frameworks that reconstruct 3D volumes from sparse 2D projections offer a promising solution, but their performance under the geometrically complex, non-zero tilt acquisitions common in interventional radiology is unknown. This study evaluates the robustness of a patient-specific deep learning framework, designed to estimate 3D motion, to a range of C-arm cranial-caudal tilts. Using a 4D digital phantom with a simulated respiratory cycle, 2D X-ray projections were simulated at five cranial-caudal tilt angles across 10 breathing phases. A separate deep learning model was trained for each tilt condition to reconstruct 3D volumetric images. The framework demonstrated consistently high-fidelity reconstruction across all tilts, with a mean Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) &gt; 0.980. While statistical analysis revealed significant differences in performance between tilt groups (p &lt; 0.0001), the absolute magnitude of these differences was minimal (e.g., the mean absolute difference in SSIM across all tilt conditions was ~0.0005), indicating they were not functionally significant. The magnitude of respiratory motion was found to be the dominant factor influencing accuracy, with the impact of C-arm tilt being a much smaller, secondary effect. These findings demonstrate that a patient-specific, motion-estimation-based deep learning approach is robust to geometric variations encountered in realistic clinical scenarios, representing a critical step towards enabling real-time 3D guidance in flexible interventional settings.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Super-Resolution Functional Ultrasound Imaging of Transient Brain-Wide Neurovascular Activity on a Microscopic Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient brain-wide neuroimaging on a microscopic scale is pivotal for brain research, yet current modalities face challenges in meeting such spatiotemporal requirements. Functional ultrasound (fUS) enables transient neurovascular imaging through red blood cell backscattering, but suffers from diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We hypothesize that deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction can break through this limitation, introducing super-resolution functional ultrasound (SR-fUS) which leverages ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) data to achieve super-resolution reconstruction of red blood cell dynamics. By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS achieves 25-{\mu}m spatial and 10-ms temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Properties of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ Nanopowders Tailored for X-Ray Photodynamic Therapy and Cathodoluminescence Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</description>
