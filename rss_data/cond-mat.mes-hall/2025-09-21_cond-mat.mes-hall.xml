      <title>Quantum oscillations in two-dimensional hole gases with competing cyclotron and Zeeman energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of critical bandstructure and quantum transport parameters in two-dimensional systems is challenging when competition emerges among different energy scales shaping quantum oscillations in a magnetic field. Here we overcome this challenge in low-disorder strained germanium quantum wells by evaluating self-consistently effective mass, g-factor, and quantum lifetime. As a result, we estimate a quantum mobility of 133(3)$\times$10$^3$ cm$^2$/Vs, setting a benchmark for 2D holes in group IV semiconductors. The high quality of the hole gas if further highlighted by observing clean fractional quantum Hall states at low magnetic field and low density.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes with non-local surface conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new framework that can be utilized for the electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with non-local surface conductivity (spatial dispersion) is presented. The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the Kubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the effective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT surface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an infinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to nonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local conductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the correct formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which are manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary conditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the exact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the Wiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of the EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a numerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its approximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing in the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved and analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the optical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for the design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out some future directions, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Absence of skewness in the voltage fluctuations of a tunnel junction in the quantum regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current fluctuations in a tunnel junction have a remarkable property: On the one hand, their variance corresponds to vacuum fluctuations at low voltage bias $V$, when the electron energy $eV$ is smaller than the photon detection energy $hf$ . On the other hand, their skewness, i.e. their third moment, is frequency independent, equal to $e^2I$ as if electron transport were simply Poissonian. We address the following question: Could it be that at low voltage, the vacuum fluctuations generated by the junction have a finite skewness, i.e. that the junction generates skewed vacuum ? To answer this question we calculate the effect of an arbitrary electromagnetic environment at zero temperature and show that the bispectrum of third moment of voltage fluctuations of any quantum conductor is always zero at frequencies larger than the voltage. We also show experimental data on tunnel junctions in the quantum regime that agree with our calculation.</description>

      <title>F\"orster transfer between quantum dots in a shared phonon environment: An exact approach, revealing the role of pure dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer has an important role in nature and technology, rendering its exact theoretical understanding significant. To this end, a system of two electronically decoupled quantum dots (QDs) is considered, interacting via dipole-dipole interaction and a common phonon bath. While the former leads to an oscillatory excitation transfer between the dots, the latter provide the dissipation resulting in directional F\"orster transfer. We present an exact microscopic treatment of the phonon-assisted transitions between hybridized exciton levels of the coupled QD system, going beyond the simple perturbative approaches commonly used in the literature. From our asymptotically exact results we extract population decay times $T_1$, dephasing times $T_2$, and resulting pure dephasing times $T_2^*$ of the states. We compare this treatment with an analytical model based on Fermi's golden rule, combining the most accurate elements of existing analytical treatments. The exact results show a significant deviation from this model in some parameter regimes, mainly due to the role of multi-phonon processes, which become important for comparable electron-phonon and dipolar coupling, realised at short distances between the QDs and at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and dynamics of quantum Hall bulk anyons in quadratic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-particle coherent states and their dynamics in the lowest Landau level (LLL) under the influence of quadratic potentials. We focus on generalized coherent states that describe Abelian anyons in the LLL and are associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We draw on parallels with quantum optics and symmetry properties of the coherent states considered here to analytically calculate quantities such as a bunching parameter, which depends on quantum statistics, as well as coherent state trajectories under the influence of generic quadratic potentials. Our results show that in unbounded saddle potentials, the bunching parameter governs the trajectories which show exponentially diverging behavior in a manner that depends on quantum statistics. In bounded elliptical potentials, the bunching parameter is oscillatory and its maximum magnitude depends on the eccentricity of the applied potential. We draw connections between our analyses and the key concepts that underlie anyon detection in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic Coupling-Driven Chiral Spin Textures: A Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion-Like Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetoelastic coupling can change the ground state of otherwise uniform spin systems to chiral spin configurations. More specifically, we show that, a periodic array of chiral spin textures can spontaneously emerge in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic system on a substrate-even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The resulting spin texture resembles a skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice, characterized by alternating scalar spin chirality and a nonuniform but sign-preserving out-of-plane spin profile. Our analysis reveals that such patterns form naturally when the magnetoelastic interaction is sufficiently strong, while the coupling between flexural phonons and the substrate is sufficiently weak. These findings uncover a previously unexplored mechanism for chiral spin texture formation driven purely by magnetoelastic coupling, signaling at potential utilities of materials with strong magnetoelastic responses.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Half-Quantized Chiral Edge Current in a C = 1/2 Parity Anomaly State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single massive Dirac surface band is predicted to exhibit a half-quantized Hall conductance, a hallmark of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state in quantum field theory. Experimental signatures of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state have been observed in semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) bilayers, yet whether it supports a half-quantized chiral edge current remains elusive. Here, we observe a robust half-quantized Hall conductance plateau in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown asymmetric magnetic TI trilayer under specific in-plane magnetic field regimes, corresponding to the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. Within this state, both nonlocal and nonreciprocal transport signals are greatly enhanced, which we identify as direct evidence for a half-quantized chiral edge current localized at the boundary of the top gapped surface. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this half-quantized chiral edge channel is the essential carrier of the observed half-quantized Hall conductance plateau, analogous to the quantized chiral edge channel in the C = 1 quantum anomalous Hall state. Our results provide experimental evidence for the half-quantized chiral edge transport in a C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. This work establishes asymmetric magnetic TI trilayers as a platform for probing single Dirac fermion physics and paves the way to explore a series of exciting phenomena in the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state, including the topological magnetoelectric effect and quantized magneto-optical response.</description>

      <title>Dynamic polarization of nuclear spins by optically-oriented electrons and holes in lead halide perovskite semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of dynamic polarization of the nuclear spin system via optically-oriented charge carriers in lead halide perovskites is developed and compared with the experiments performed on a FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ crystal. The spin Hamiltonians of the electron and hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins of lead and halogen are derived. The hyperfine interaction of the halogen spins with charge carriers is shown to be anisotropic and depending on the position of the halogen nucleus in the cubic elementary cell. The quadrupole splitting is absent for the lead spins, but plays an important role for the halogen spins and affects their dynamic polarization by charge carriers. The Overhauser fields of the dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated as functions of the tilting angle of an external magnetic field and compared with the experimentally measured angular dependence of the Hanle effect. The comparison of the theoretical model with the experimental data reveals an enhanced spin polarization of the lead nuclei, whose mean spin exceeds several times the mean spins of localized electrons and holes. This unexpectedly strong spin polarization is explained by the interaction of the lead nuclei with excitons having a high degree of spin orientation due to their short lifetime after excitation by circularly-polarized light. The dynamic polarization of the quadrupole-split halogen spins manifests itself via the magnetic field they produce at the lead nuclei. This field maintains the magnetization of the lead nuclei at zero external magnetic field. The dynamics of the nuclear spin polarization is measured under optical pumping and in the dark, yielding a nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time on the order of 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process, showing that it features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>A heat-resilient hole spin qubit in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal plasmons in one-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for nonreciprocal nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum theory of magnonic and magnetoelastic nonlinear dynamics in continuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electronic Crystal Phases in the Presence of Non-Uniform Berry Curvature and Tunable Berry Flux: The $\lambda_N$-Jellium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer graphene systems have rekindled interest in electronic crystal phases in two dimensions -- but now for phases enriched by non-trivial quantum geometry. In this work, we introduce a simple continuum model with tunable Berry curvature distribution and total flux, enabling systematic study of crystallization in geometrically nontrivial bands. In the noninteracting limit, the addition of a C6-symmetric periodic potential yields a rich phase diagram, for which we provide several analytical insights. Notably, we derive a general formula for the Chern number in the weak-potential regime that is broadly applicable to single-band projected models. Removing the periodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline states, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which localized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to depleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous Hall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We identify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and energetic considerations.

      <description>arXiv:2509.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</description>

      <title>Topology and Spectral Entanglement in Cavity-Mediated Photon Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a diagrammatic theory of cavity-mediated photon-photon interactions in a topological insulator using the SSH model. The fourth-order vertex $\Gamma^{(4)}(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ governs spectral entanglement and Kerr nonlinearity, leading to a nonlinear topological phase diagram. We also compute the electronic self-energy from vacuum photon exchange and identify symmetry-imposed limits on band renormalization. These results link band geometry to the emergence of light-matter correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation in periodic media is governed by energy-momentum relation and geometric phases characterizing band topology, such as Zak phase in one-dimensional lattices. We demonstrate that in the off-diagonal trimer lattices Zak phase carries quantized screw-type dislocations winding around degeneracies in parameter space. If the lattice evolves in time periodically, as in adiabatic Thouless pump, corresponding closed trajectory in parameter space is characterized by a Chern number equal the negative total winding number of Zak phase dislocations enclosed by the trajectory. We discuss correspondence between bulk Chern numbers and the edge-states in a finite system evolving along various pumping cycles.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology of transport in the quantum Hall phases in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that signatures of non-Hermitian topology can be realized in a conventional quantum Hall device connected to multiple current sources. These signatures manifest as robust current-voltage characteristics, dictated by the presence of a nontrivial, non-Hermitian topological invariant of the conductance matrix. Chiral edge states are believed to be responsible for this non-Hermitian response, similar to how they lead to a quantized Hall conductivity in the presence of a single current source. Here, we go beyond this paradigm, showing that multi-terminal conductance matrices can exhibit non-Hermitian topological phase transitions that cannot be traced back to the presence and directionality of a boundary-localized chiral mode. By performing quantum transport simulations in the quantum Hall regime of monolayer graphene, we find that when the chemical potential is swept across the zeroth Landau level, unavoidable device imperfections cause the appearance of an additional non-Hermitian phase of the conductance matrix. This highlights graphene as an ideal platform for the study of non-Hermitian topological phase transitions, and is a first step towards exploring how the geometry of quantum devices can be harnessed to produce robust, topologically-protected transport characteristics.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Brownian Ratchets for Directed Transport of Analytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlled long-range transport of micro- and nano-scale objects is a key requirement in lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic applications, enabling the efficient capture, concentration, manipulation, and detection of analytes. Traditional methods such as microfluidic pumps and optical trapping face challenges including high power consumption and limited range of action. This study introduces a plasmonic Brownian ratchet designed for the directed transport of dielectric nanometer-sized particles at low optical powers. Through numerical simulations, the ratchet geometry was optimized to enhance electric fields, optical forces, and trapping potentials. Experimentally, the plasmonic ratchet demonstrated the ability to rectify random thermal motion of 40 nm polysterene spheres over extended distances in a specific direction, achieving velocities up to 2.4 $\mu$m/s at excitation powers as low as 0.785 kW/cm^2. This plasmonic ratchet offers a robust and efficient solution for the targeted delivery and concentration of nanoscale analytes on chips, with significant implications for advancing applications in the life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Proposal for spin superfluid quantum interference device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In easy-plane magnets, the spin superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID), inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of an electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency shift of the harmonic modes induced by this magnonic Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological corner states in the continuum of extended kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is renowned for its exotic electronic properties, such as flat bands, Dirac points, and Van Hove singularities. These features have provided a fertile ground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we discover that a breathing kagome lattice with long-range hoppings can host multiple zero-energy corner states, which emerge as topologically protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). This result demonstrates that additional hopping control can induce further non-trivial physics of the kagome lattice. Since the zero-energy corner states in the continuum are intertwined with a substantial number of zero-energy bulk states, we also develop a momentum-space topological characterization theory to precisely quantify the number of corner states, revealing a general bulk-corner correspondence. Furthermore, we uncover three distinct types of topological phase transitions (TPTs) for the BICs driven by shifts in the spatial localization of zero-energy bulk and/or edge states. These TPTs are exactly captured by our characterization theory. This work provides deep insights into the topological physics of the kagome lattice and broadens the understanding of its electronic properties</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</description>

If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of $k_z$-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in a single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals by a special Floquet driving that preserves time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry</title>

Abstract: We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states of continuous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.</description>

      <title>Strong thermoelectric response of nanoconfined weak electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When dissolved, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in a temperature-dependent process. We show herein that such incomplete dissociation yields an enormous thermoelectric response in an electrolyte-filled nanochannel along which a temperature gradient is applied. For this purpose, an extended version of the Nernst-Planck equations is developed that takes into account the temperature-dependent dissociation-association equilibrium. The results indicate that in this way, Seebeck coefficients can be achieved that outperform all previously reported values.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work lays the foundation for studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ferroelectric Potential Landscape of 3R-MoS$_2$ through Optical Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</description>
