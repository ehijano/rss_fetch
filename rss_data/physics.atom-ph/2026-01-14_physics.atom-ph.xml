      <title>The 0.5 Ratio Limit and Geometry-Induced Missing Energy: Universal 3D Quantum Constraints on Fragment Distributions from Attosecond to Subatomic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sudden approximation is a fundamental tool for describing ultrafast quantum transitions, yet the relationship between the initial 3D wavefunction and the final kinetic energy release (KER) remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the observed fragment energy distribution $P(E)$ following a sudden Coulomb explosion is a direct manifestation of the initial state's 3D radial geometry. By applying a Bohmian-inspired local energy framework to Slater-type orbitals, we identify a universal \textbf{``0.5 Rule''}: for ground-state configurations, the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated average energy ($R_E = E_{peak}/\langle E \rangle$) is strictly bounded below 0.5. Our systematic parametric study reveals that this ratio is highly sensitive to the orbital exponent $\zeta$ and the principal quantum number $n$. Specifically, $R_E$ decreases significantly as $\zeta$ increases, suggesting that the kinetic energy of fragments from inner-shell orbitals is far more suppressed than that of valence electrons. We further show that for excited states ($n &gt; 1$), the emergence of secondary high-energy peaks provides a theoretical explanation for the structured KER spectra observed in $H_2^+$ ionization experiments. Finally, we propose that this geometric energy shift offers a new perspective on the ``missing energy'' problem in particle physics. Our findings suggest that a detected energy peak lower than the statistical mean may be an intrinsic signature of 3D quantum-spatial distribution ($r^2|\psi|^2$) rather than proof of undetected particles. This work provides a rigorous framework for recalibrating experimental energy signals across atomic, molecular, and subatomic scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin polarization of Rb atoms undergoing light-induced desorption from a spin-polarized Co (110) surface was investigated. Desorption induced by pulsed UV-light irradiation was driven by a non-thermal mechanism and the spins of the desorbed Rb atoms were polarized. This implies spin transfer between the surface and the adsorbate during desorption.</description>

      <title>Causality of ultrafast photoionization from argon 3s using an ab initio relativistic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real-time photoionization flux at the $3s$ Amusia-Cooper minimum (ACM) in argon using \textit{ab initio} simulations with the relativistic time-dependent configuration-interaction singles (RTDCIS) method in length (LG) and velocity (VG) gauges. A simple analytical model is used to interpret the results, and to construct Wigner delays and Wigner distributions for both gauges and relativistic channels of the photoelectron ($\epsilon p_j$ with $j=1/2$ and $3/2$). The two gauges are found to produce qualitatively different ionization dynamics, with LG having positive and VG having negative Wigner delays. The advancement of several femtoseconds, found for Wigner delays in VG, raises some concern for causality when atoms are ionized by attosecond pulses that are shorter than the absolute value of the Wigner delay. Reassuringly, numerical simulations of wave packets with RTDCIS show that the electrons behave in a causal way in both gauges. Weighted delays that take into account the temporal window of excitation (or the bandwidth of the pulses) are constructed from the Wigner distribution to reach agreement between the numerical simulations and our simple wave packet model. Furthermore, a strong effect of spin-orbit coupling of the photoelectron ($j$) is reported for ultrafast photoionization dynamics, and Schr\"odinger kitten and cat states are identified in the Wigner distributions as a result of the ACM. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast photoionization and the role of causality in systems with strong electron-electron correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Excluding Hypothetical Light Boson Interpretation of Yb King Plot Nonlinearity with the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ Isotope Shift Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precision spectroscopy and isotope shift measurement of the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ clock transition in neutral ytterbium ($\mathrm{Yb}$) atoms. By revealing a magic wavelength at $905.4(2)$ nm, we successfully achieve the atomic spectrum narrower than $100$ Hz. The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements. This work paves the way for the effective use of precision isotope shift data in the King plot analysis and stimulates further measurements in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and other elements.</description>

      <title>Portable Single-Beam Atomic Total-Field Magnetometer for Stand-off Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically pumped atomic magnetometers (OPAMs) offer high sensitivity at room temperature and are increasingly considered for portable magnetic sensing in geomagnetic-field environments. Here we report a handheld-scale, single-beam scalar $^{87}$Rb OPAM with a sensor-head volume of approximately 110 mL. The device operates in an all-optical Bell-Bloom configuration and uses digital lock-in, dispersive tracking of the $^{87}$Rb Larmor resonance, implemented with a hybrid electronics stack that combines in-house control hardware with commercial modules. A single frequency-modulated laser beam performs both pumping and probing without RF coils. In an unshielded indoor environment, the magnetometer exhibits a noise floor below 6 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ near 80 Hz and a measurement bandwidth of 200 Hz. In an unshielded Earth-field deployment, we detect repeatable transient magnetic signatures from a controlled elevator motion sequence and quantify standoff observability over sensor-elevator distances from 1.25 m to 10 m. These results show that compact scalar OPAMs can provide bandwidth and range-resolved event sensitivity suitable for field-deployable magnetic anomaly detection and infrastructure monitoring in realistic geomagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Point-enhanced Rydberg Atomic Electrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their large transition dipole moments and extreme sensitivity to electric fields, have attracted widespread attention as promising candidates for next-generation quantum precision electrometry. Meanwhile, exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems have opened new avenues for ultrasensitive metrology. Despite increasing interest in non-Hermitian physics, EP-enhanced sensitivity has rarely been explored in Rydberg atomic platforms. Here, we provide a new theoretical understanding of Autler-Townes (AT)-based Rydberg electrometry under non-Hermitian conditions, showing that dissipation fundamentally modifies the spectral response and enables sensitivity enhancement via EP-induced nonlinearity. Experimentally, we realize a second-order EP in a passive thermal Rydberg system without requiring gain media or cryogenics, and demonstrate the first EP-enhanced atomic electrometer. The EP can be tuned in real time by adjusting laser and microwave parameters, forming a flexible and scalable platform. Near the EP, the system exhibits a square-root response, yielding a nearly 20-fold enhancement in responsivity. Using amplitude-based detection, we achieve a sensitivity of $22.68~\mathrm{nV cm^{-1} Hz^{-1/2}}$ under realistic conditions. Our work establishes a practical, tunable platform for EP-enhanced sensing and real-time control, with broad implications for quantum metrology in open systems.</description>

      <title>Splitting of the three-body F\"orster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\"orster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the F\"orster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</description>

      <title>Control of valence-electron motion in Xe cations using the stimulated-Raman-adiabatic-passage technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussian envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>
