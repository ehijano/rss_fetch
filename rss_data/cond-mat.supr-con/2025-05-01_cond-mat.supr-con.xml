      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in X4H15compounds via hole-doping at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a computational investigation of X4H15 compounds (where X represents a metal) as potential superconductors at ambient conditions or under pressure. Through systematic density functional theory calculations and electron-phonon coupling analysis, we demonstrate that electronic structure engineering via hole doping dramatically enhances the superconducting properties of these materials. While electron-doped compounds with X4+ cations (Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) exhibit modest transition temperatures of 1-9 K, hole-doped systems with X3+cations (Y, Tb, Dy, Ho,Er, Tm, Lu) show remarkably higher values of approximately 50 K at ambient pressure. Superconductivity in hole-doped compounds originates from stronger coupling between electrons and both cation and hydrogen phonon modes. Although pristine X3+4H15compounds are thermodynamically unstable, we propose a viable synthesis route via controlled hole doping of the charge-compensated YZr3H15 compound. Our calculations predict that even minimal concentrations of excess Y could induce high-temperature superconductivity while preserving structural integrity. This work reveals how strategic electronic structure modulation can optimize superconducting properties in hydride systems, establishing a promising pathway toward practical high-temperature conventional super-conductors at ambient pressure</description>

Abstract: The pressure-temperature phase diagram of superconducting UTe$_2$ with three lines of the second-order phase transitions cannot be explained in terms of successive transitions to superconducting states with a decrease in symmetry. The problem is solved using a two-band description of the superconducting state of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topotactical hydrogen induced single-band $d$-wave superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of trivalent substituents for La. In this work, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provides theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Vortex flow anisotropy in nematic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the vortex flow anisotropy in the mixed state of nematic superconductors, focusing on the effects of nematic-superconducting coupling on vortex dynamics. Using numerical simulations within a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) approach, we analyze vortex viscosity in a model featuring an s-wave superconducting order parameter coupled to an Ising-like nematic order parameter, suitable for systems with $C_4$ symmetry. Our results indicate that nematicity induces a significant anisotropy in the flux-flow resistivity, which depends on both vortex core shape anisotropy and normal-phase conductivity anisotropy. These two effects can either compete or cooperate with each other. We discuss the implications of these findings for identifying nematic superconductivity in the superconducting phase. Our work provides new insights into the interplay between nematic and superconducting order parameters, leading to new possibilities for experimental and theoretical exploration of anisotropic transport properties in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Josephson effect in hybrid superconductor-hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider hybrid systems consisting of a hole-doped semiconductor coupled to electronic states of finite-size superconductors, where the opposite sign of the masses in the two subsystems give rise to insulating gaps at subband anticrossings. Consequently, increasing the coupling strength to the superconductor can paradoxically suppress the proximity-induced superconductivity in the semiconductor by enhancing these insulating gaps. We demonstrate that the presence of such induced insulating gaps leads to a characteristic anomalous behavior of the critical supercurrent in Josephson junctions based on these hybrid structures. Our findings provide important insights for the design of robust quantum computing platforms utilizing hybrid superconductor-hole systems.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Superconductivity at 18.2 K in CuIr2S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S4's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Revealing the loss mechanisms of a 3D superconducting microwave cavity for use in a dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but symmetric in respect of product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>
