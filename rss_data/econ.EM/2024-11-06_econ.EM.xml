      <title>Does Regression Produce Representative Causal Rankings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the challenges in ranking multiple treatments based on their estimated effects when using linear regression or its popular double-machine-learning variant, the Partially Linear Model (PLM), in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity. We demonstrate by example that overlap-weighting performed by linear models like PLM can produce Weighted Average Treatment Effects (WATE) that have rankings that are inconsistent with the rankings of the underlying Average Treatment Effects (ATE). We define this as ranking reversals and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for ranking reversals under the PLM. We conclude with several simulation studies conditions under which ranking reversals occur.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Traditional VIX: A Novel Approach to Identifying Uncertainty Shocks in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new identification strategy for uncertainty shocks to explain macroeconomic volatility in financial markets. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) measures market expectations of future volatility, but traditional methods based on second-moment shocks and time-varying volatility of the VIX often fail to capture the non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed nature of asset returns. To address this, we construct a revised VIX by fitting a double-subordinated Normal Inverse Gaussian Levy process to S&amp;P 500 option prices, providing a more comprehensive measure of volatility that reflects the extreme movements and heavy tails observed in financial data. Using an axiomatic approach, we introduce a general family of risk-reward ratios, computed with our revised VIX and fitted over a fractional time series to more accurately identify uncertainty shocks in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Randomly assigned first differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider treatment-effect estimation with a panel data with two periods, using a first difference regression of the outcome evolution $\Delta Y_g$ on the treatment evolution $\Delta D_g$. A design-based justification of this estimator assumes that $\Delta D_g$ is as good as randomly assigned. This note shows that if one posits a causal model in levels between the treatment and the outcome, then $\Delta D_g$ randomly assigned implies that $\Delta D_g$ is independent of $D_{g,1}$. This is a very strong, fully testable condition. If $\Delta D_g$ is not independent of $D_{g,1}$, the first-difference estimator can still identify a convex combination of effects if $\Delta D_g$ is randomly assigned and treatment effects do not change over time, or if the the treatment path $(D_{g,1},D_{g,2})$ is randomly assigned and either of the following conditions hold: i) $D_{g,1}$ and $D_{g,2}$ are binary; ii) $D_{g,1}$ and $D_{g,2}$ have the same variance; iii) $D_{g,1}$ and $D_{g,2}$ are uncorrelated or negatively correlated. I use these results to revisit Acemoglu et al (2016).</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis when the Number of Factors is Unknown' by S. Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter, D. Hosszejni, and H. Freitas Lopes written by Roberto Casarin and Antonio Peruzzi (Ca' Foscari University of Venice)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The techniques suggested in Fr\"uhwirth-Schnatter et al. (2024) concern sparsity and factor selection and have enormous potential beyond standard factor analysis applications. We show how these techniques can be applied to Latent Space (LS) models for network data. These models suffer from well-known identification issues of the latent factors due to likelihood invariance to factor translation, reflection, and rotation (see Hoff et al., 2002). A set of observables can be instrumental in identifying the latent factors via auxiliary equations (see Liu et al., 2021). These, in turn, share many analogies with the equations used in factor modeling, and we argue that the factor loading restrictions may be beneficial for achieving identification.</description>

      <title>Robust Market Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large differentiated oligopoly yields inefficient market equilibria. An authority with imprecise information about the primitives of the market aims to design tax/subsidy interventions that increase efficiency robustly, i.e., with high probability. We identify a condition on demand that guarantees the existence of such interventions, and we show how to construct them using noisy estimates of demand complementarities and substitutabilities across products. The analysis works by deriving a novel description of the incidence of market interventions in terms of spectral statistics of a Slutsky matrix. Our notion of recoverable structure ensures that parts of the spectrum that are useful for the design of interventions are statistically recoverable from noisy demand estimates.</description>

      <title>How to Detect Network Dependence in Latent Factor Models? A Bias-Corrected CD Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper Juodis and Reese (2022) (JR) show that the application of the CD test proposed by Pesaran (2004) to residuals from panels with latent factors results in over-rejection. They propose a randomized test statistic to correct for over-rejection, and add a screening component to achieve power. This paper considers the same problem but from a different perspective, and shows that the standard CD test remains valid if the latent factors are weak in the sense the strength is less than half. In the case where latent factors are strong, we propose a bias-corrected version, CD*, which is shown to be asymptotically standard normal under the null of error cross-sectional independence and have power against network type alternatives. This result is shown to hold for pure latent factor models as well as for panel regression models with latent factors. The case where the errors are serially correlated is also considered. Small sample properties of the CD* test are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and are shown to have the correct size for strong and weak factors as well as for Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors. In contrast, it is found that JR's test tends to over-reject in the case of panels with non-Gaussian errors, and has low power against spatial network alternatives. In an empirical application, using the CD* test, it is shown that there remains spatial error dependence in a panel data model for real house price changes across 377 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the U.S., even after the effects of latent factors are filtered out.</description>

      <title>Quantile Random-Coefficient Regression with Interactive Fixed Effects: Heterogeneous Group-Level Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantile random-coefficient regression with interactive fixed effects to study the effects of group-level policies that are heterogeneous across individuals. Our approach is the first to use a latent factor structure to handle the unobservable heterogeneities in the random coefficient. The asymptotic properties and an inferential method for the policy estimators are established. The model is applied to evaluate the effect of the minimum wage policy on earnings between 1967 and 1980 in the United States. Our results suggest that the minimum wage policy has significant and persistent positive effects on black workers and female workers up to the median. Our results also indicate that the policy helps reduce income disparity up to the median between two groups: black, female workers versus white, male workers. However, the policy is shown to have little effect on narrowing the income gap between low- and high-income workers within the subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Using Multiple Outcomes to Improve the Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When there are multiple outcome series of interest, Synthetic Control analyses typically proceed by estimating separate weights for each outcome. In this paper, we instead propose estimating a common set of weights across outcomes, by balancing either a vector of all outcomes or an index or average of them. Under a low-rank factor model, we show that these approaches lead to lower bias bounds than separate weights, and that averaging leads to further gains when the number of outcomes grows. We illustrate this via a re-analysis of the impact of the Flint water crisis on educational outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Approach with Marginals for Modeling Consumer Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06115v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given data on the choices made by consumers for different offer sets, a key challenge is to develop parsimonious models that describe and predict consumer choice behavior while being amenable to prescriptive tasks such as pricing and assortment optimization. The marginal distribution model (MDM) is one such model, which requires only the specification of marginal distributions of the random utilities. This paper aims to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for given choice data to be consistent with the MDM hypothesis, inspired by the usefulness of similar characterizations for the random utility model (RUM). This endeavor leads to an exact characterization of the set of choice probabilities that the MDM can represent. Verifying the consistency of choice data with this characterization is equivalent to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Since the analogous verification task for RUM is computationally intractable and neither of these models subsumes the other, MDM is helpful in striking a balance between tractability and representational power. The characterization is then used with robust optimization for making data-driven sales and revenue predictions for new unseen assortments. When the choice data lacks consistency with the MDM hypothesis, finding the best-fitting MDM choice probabilities reduces to solving a mixed integer convex program. Numerical results using real world data and synthetic data demonstrate that MDM exhibits competitive representational power and prediction performance compared to RUM and parametric models while being significantly faster in computation than RUM.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Deep Neural Networks with Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</description>
