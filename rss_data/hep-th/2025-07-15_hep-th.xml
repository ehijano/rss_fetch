      <title>Long-range to the Rescue of Yang-Baxter II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin chain model capturing the one-loop spectral problem of the simplest $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory in four dimensions, obtained from a marginal deformation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In Part I of this work \cite{Bozkurt:2024tpz}, we solved for the three-magnon eigenvector and found that it exhibits long-range behavior, despite the Hamiltonian being of nearest-neighbor type. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the four-magnon sector and construct explicit eigenvectors. These solutions are compatible with both untwisted and twisted periodic boundary conditions, and they allow for the computation of anomalous dimensions of single-trace operators of the gauge theory. We validate our results by direct comparison with brute-force diagonalization of the spin chain Hamiltonian. Additionally, we uncover a novel structural relation between eigenstates with different numbers of excitations. In particular, we show that the four-magnon eigenstates can be written in terms of the three-magnon solution, revealing a recursive pattern and hinting at a deeper underlying structure. Lastly, the four-magnon solution obeys an infinite tower of Yang-Baxter equations, as was the case for the three-magnon solution.</description>

      <title>Connecting boundary entropy and effective central charge at holographic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of intervals in $1+1$ interface CFTs is modified in two ways compared to a CFT without interface: there is a finite boundary entropy contribution, and, for an interval with an endpoint at the interface, the coefficient of the logarithmically divergent contribution -- which is usually proportional to the central charge of the CFT -- is modified to an effective central charge. We show that the latter modification can be understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs. Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant and Generic Formulation of Magnetic Translations and so(3,1) Curtright-Zachos Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic translation (GMT) operators, eliminating the gauge dependence that conventional definitions suffer from due to specific gauge choices. We extend this framework by incorporating so(3,1) conformal symmetry, demonstrating how GMT operators can be naturally embedded within this algebraic structure. We then show the fundamental role of sim(2) duality between pseudo-dilatation and pseudo-angular momentum operators in constructing GMT operators. A key result of this approach is the derivation of the Curtright-Zachos (CZ) generators from gauge-invariant so(3,1) operators, providing a novel perspective on their algebraic properties such as the relationship between FFZ internal symmetry and sim(2) duality.</description>

      <title>Adjustment of Faddeev-Popov quantization to reducible gauge theories: antisymmetric tensor fermion in $AdS_d$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the method adjusting the Faddeev-Popov factorization procedure for the quantization of generic reducible gauge theories with linearly dependent generators and apply it to the first stage reducible model of second rank antisymmetric fermion in d-dimensional AdS spacetime. The method consists in nested factorizations of the gauge group volume for the determination of the consistently defined delta function of reduced gauge conditions, group integration measure and gauge-fixed contribution of ghosts. It is compared to the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism of quantizing theories with linearly dependent generators and shown to be equivalent to it for first stage reducible theories. Nevertheless, the method under consideration, unlike the BV formalism, from the very beginning leads to the functional integral with fewer number of ghosts. Using this method we quantized the variant of fermionic totally antisymmetric tensor-spinor theory in AdS space and derived its effective action in terms of the functional determinants of special Dirac-type operators. Limitations of the method are also discussed along with the prospects of its extension to higher reducibility stages and higher rank models of antisymmetric fermions.</description>

      <title>Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</description>

      <title>Relationship between a $\Phi^4$ matrix model and harmonic oscillator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hermitian $\Phi^4$ matrix model with a Kontsevich-type kinetic term is studied. It was recently discovered that the partition function of this matrix model satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation of the $N$-body harmonic oscillator, and that eigenstates of the Virasoro operators can be derived from this partition function. We extend these results and obtain an explicit formula for such eigenstates in terms of the free energy. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger equation for the $N$-body harmonic oscillator can also be reformulated in terms of connected correlation functions. The $U(1)^N$-symmetry allows us to derive loop equations.</description>

      <title>2-loop scattering on superstring and supermembrane in flat space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the S-matrix of transverse scalar excitations on an infinite $D=10$ GS superstring and $D=11$ supermembrane in flat target space. We compute the 4-particle scattering amplitude in the 2-loop approximation and demonstrate that, like in the Nambu string case, the $D=10$ GS string S-matrix does not contain non-trivial 2d UV divergences (UV pole not accompanied by terms with logarithms of momenta is an artifact of dimensional regularization). This is consistent with underlying integrability of this model which is maintaining by adding appropriate local counterterms. In the supermembrane case there are no 1-loop divergences but we find a genuine 2-loop UV pole. This demonstrates non-renormalizability of the world-volume S-matrix of the M2 brane theory.</description>

      <title>A-type open $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain the eigenfunctions of the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter $\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral generalized to the complex field.</description>

      <title>Acyclonesto-cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally, an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby extending recent results for graph associahedra.
  Furthermore, just as Stasheff associahedra admit truncation into cosmohedra that encode the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, we show the acyclonestohedra also admit a truncation into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as sections of graph cosmohedra.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal relation of Schwinger pair production between $\textrm{dS}_2$ and $\textrm{AdS}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect with e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a sum of contour integrals of the frequency in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Backreaction of Dirac Matter in the Context of the SYK Model: Non-Gaussian Random Couplings and Bulk Mass Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate further on the backreaction of Dirac matter in the SYK framework, incorporating non-Gaussian coupling distributions and bulk fermion mass effects. Our study analyzes quartic matter couplings generated by a non-Gaussian distribution as an illustrative example. The introduction of bulk-fermion mass alters the boundary coupling between the Dirac and Majorana fermions. The averaged adjacent gap ratio is sensitive to the distribution of random couplings, which remains independent of the Hamiltonian's symmetry. The generalization of the SYK model to non-Gaussian distributions and the inclusion of bulk fermion mass remain qualitatively similar to the Gaussian and massless cases. Key deviations manifest only in the time scales for the linear ramp in the spectral form factor and entanglement entropy saturation.</description>

      <title>Character of the highest weight module of BMS algebra realized on codimensional-two boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the vacuum character of BMS$_3$ exactly agrees with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity distributions of the high frequency gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands, the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities (e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.</description>

      <title>Short range intervortex forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as $d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex. The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings $0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$ and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) approach is traditionally developed for a Euclidean path integral derivation of black hole entropy. In this work, we extend this approach to a static model of thin shell fixed outside a black hole. We compute the Euclidean action shift from a static thin shell outside the black hole, and find exact agreement with Casini's version of Bekenstein bound. We find a negative entropy deficit corresponding precisely to the apparent horizon area perturbation, which provides a holographic interpretation in terms of extremal surfaces.
  Therefore, we develop a Euclidean framework in which gravity emerges from a negative entropy gradient. This setup allows us to treat the configuration as a near-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Thus, we introduce Onsager reciprocity and a linear-response relation to clarify the entropic force conjecture. A dissipating external force is necessary in this setup and it generates a Hawking temperature gradient which encoding information responsible for entropy gradient. This confirms that the gravitational potential plays the role of an informational and ordering agent, rather than just driven by chaotic and disordering.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Hole with String Cloud Deformation: Entanglement and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a holographic analysis of several quantum information theoretic observables entanglement entropy (EE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS), butterfly velocity ($v_B$) and thermo mutual information (TMI) in the background of charged AdS black hole deformed by a homogeneous string cloud. This configuration is dual to a large $\mathcal{N}_c$ strongly coupled field theory at finite temperature and finite chemical potential, in presence of quark cloud. We study how the entanglement structure and chaotic dynamics in the boundary theory are affected by the charge and backreaction. We find that both EE and EWCS increase monotonically with charge and backreaction, indicating enhanced correlations due to additional bulk degrees of freedom. On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate dependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing charge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to scrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the presence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the system by reducing $v_B$. Furthermore, TMI exhibits a sharp transition under shockwave perturbations, with inter-boundary entanglement being entirely disrupted beyond a critical shock strength, which decreases with increasing charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a field theory with a $\mathbb Z_N$ $p$-form symmetry generically admits, in addition to a Higgs phase and a 'confining' phase, a Coulomb phase in which the infrared theory contains Abelian $p$-form electrodynamics, similar to the behaviour of Yang-Mills theory coupled to adjoint or fundamental matter. We illustrate our claim with continuum and lattice examples.</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonian and entanglement entropy in the BMS free fermion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian and the entanglement entropy of the BMS-invariant free fermion model. Starting from the modular Hamiltonian on a half-line interval, we calculate the modular Hamiltonian for a region consisting of two disjoint intervals using the uniformization map and a background field method. The resulting modular Hamiltonian contains a local term which generates a geometrical flow, and a bi-local term which mixes operators between the two intervals. We further derive a relation between Wightman functions and the modular Hamiltonian using both diagonalization and a coherent state method. This enables us to compute the entanglement entropy for multi-disjoint intervals. Our explicit results in the BMS free fermion model are compatible with earlier ones based on symmetry and holography.</description>

      <title>Resolving Degeneracies in Complex $\mathbb{R}\times S^3$ and $\theta$-KSW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentzian gravitational path integral for the Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $4D$ is studied in the mini-superspace ansatz for metric. The gauge-fixed path-integral for Robin boundary choice is computed exactly using {\it Airy}-functions, where the dominant contribution comes from No-boundary geometries. The lapse integral is further analysed using saddle-point methods to compare with exact results. Picard-Lefschetz methods are utilized to find the {\it relevant} complex saddles and deformed contour of integration thereby using WKB methods to compute the integral along the deformed contour in the saddle-point approximation. However, their successful application is possible only when system is devoid of degeneracies, which in present case appear in two types: {\bf type-1} where the flow-lines starting from neighbouring saddles overlap leading to ambiguities in deciding the {\it relevance} of saddles, {\bf type-2} where saddles merge for specific choices of boundary parameters leading to failure of WKB. Overcoming degeneracies using artificial {\it defects} introduces ambiguities due to choice of {\it defects} involved. Corrections from quantum fluctuations of scale-factor overcome degeneracies only partially (lifts {\bf type-2} completely with partial resolution of {\bf type-1}), with the residual lifted fluently by complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$. {\it Anti-linear} symmetry present in various forms in the lapse action is the reason behind all the {\bf type-1} degeneracies. Any form of {\it defect} or {\it deformation} breaking anti-linearity resolves {\bf type-1} degeneracies, indicating complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ as an ideal choice. Compatibility with the KSW criterion is analyzed after symmetry breaking. Complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ modifies the KSW criterion, imposing a strong constraint on the deformation if No-boundary geometries are required to be always KSW-allowed.</description>

      <title>Quark flavors in hot and dense holographic QCD: setup and comparison to data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a flavor dependent holographic framework for hot and dense QCD. To this end, we generalize a class of bottom-up holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano limit (V-QCD) by incorporating explicit flavor dependence. Specifically, we develop a $2+1$ flavor model characterized by two massless light quarks and a massive strange quark. Including the non-zero quark mass modifies the tachyon dependence of the model action, which yields a good agreement with the lattice data for thermodynamics in QCD in the low baryon number density and high temperature limit. We compare the model with various hadron resonance gas models at low temperature. We also compute the equation of state (EOS) at high density and low temperatures and found a smooth matching of this EOS with the nuclear matter EOS, suggesting significantly lower latent heat of the nuclear to quark matter transition than in earlier version of the V-QCD model. We observe that the smooth matching with the nuclear theory EOS is only applicable to a subset of potentials; furthermore, constraining the predictions of the model by limiting the potential parameters. We also identify the relevant fixed points of the model, particularly AdS$_2$ and AdS$_5$ fixed points.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of scalar field dynamics in modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a tanh-parametrized scalar field model in the framework of modified $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity by adopting the form $f(Q, L_{m})=\beta Q+\delta L_{m}$ along with a scalar field energy density $\rho_\phi = \rho_{c0} \tanh(A + Bz)$. Using MCMC methods and combining $31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$ Pantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain $H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and $B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift $z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent with a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further analyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder diagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter phase. Additionally, we study black hole mass accretion, showing its dependence on the scalar field dynamics. This work highlights the compatibility of tanh-scalar field forms with $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in describing cosmic acceleration and gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Out of the darkness: probing the inflationary era with dark photon dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent hint reported by the TASEH haloscope suggests the possible detection of dark photon dark matter with mass $19.5~{\rm \mu eV}$. Due to their production during inflation, dark photons act as unique messengers from this primordial epoch. We explore the implications that a confirmed detection would have in directly probing the inflationary era for the first time. To resolve the intrinsic degeneracy between the dark photon mixing parameter and its fractional relic abundance introduced by haloscope measurements, we motivate a next-generation light-shining-through-a-wall experiment. Combining these two experiences with cosmological data, particularly measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to reconstruct dark photon properties. We delineate a coherent strategy for simultaneously determining the dark photon kinetic coupling, abundance, and properties of the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Frozen states of charged boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study frozen states of charged boson stars. These solutions are globally regular and exist in a U(1) gauged scalar field model minimally coupled to gravity for suitable choices of the coupling constants. These configurations are field theoretical realizations of the Mazur-Mottola solution with a de Sitter interior, a black hole exterior and a thin shell that interpolates between the two and replaces the event horizon. We demonstrate that standard electrodynamics is sufficient to find these frozen states, but that the self-interaction of the scalar field is crucial. Adding Horndeski vector-tensor gravity to the model allows the frozen states to exist without self-interaction though. The frozen states possess one stable and one unstable lightring, the former inside the thin shell, the latter in the black hole exterior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Considering an action in F(G) modified gravity, the static spherically symmetric solutions are investigated. Introducing the Lagrangian multipliers {\alpha} we obtain the Lagrangian and equations of motion. we obtain two type solutions for these models. The first case leads to Schwarzschild-de Sitter (anti de Sitter) solution and the other one, results in a new metric. At last, the event horizon, the Hawking temperature and the generalized second law of thermodynamics in the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for this solution as a black hole are investigated.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological dynamics of scalar-tensor models of dark energy in teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar-tensor theory in teleparallel gravity where a general function of the scalar field, f(phi), is non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar T. First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we study the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and non-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We analyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The cosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma = f'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] / [V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi) proportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law potential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by mathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and show that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a radiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately 1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0. Moreover, small sigma^2 ensures radiation and matter dominance in the respective eras. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory in this setting.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a form of the local thermodynamic equilibrium density operator which is invariant under pseudo-gauge transformations of the stress-energy and the spin tensors. This operator is an excellent candidate to describe the dynamics of a system which is assumed to achieve local equilibrium from a pseudo-gauge invariant quantum state, a situation which is believed to occur, for instance, in nuclear collisions at very high energy. As a consequence of pseudo-gauge invariance, the ambiguity affecting the predictions of mean values of observables from a local equilibrium state can be removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive fermions produced through weak charged interactions possess a definite chirality, which is not conserved during free propagation, leading to chiral oscillations. Neutrinos also exhibit flavor oscillations. These phenomena have been extensively studied - both individually and within a unified framework - using the first quantization approach, but only separately in the context of quantum field theory. In this work, we address this gap by developing a quantum field theory treatment of flavor-chiral oscillations. Focusing on the case of two-flavor mixing, we compute the expectation values of the (non-conserved) chiral-flavor charges and recover the same oscillation formulas obtained in the first quantization formalism. These charges are diagonalized via Bogoliubov transformations in both the chiral and flavor sectors. Such transformations reveal a non-trivial structure of the chiral-flavor vacuum, which consists of a condensate of particles with definite masses and helicities.</description>

      <title>On the Infeasibility of Low-Energy Warp Drive via Metamaterial Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent ``low-energy'' warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ with a spatially varying scalar field $\kappa(x)$ set by an engineered metamaterial's electromagnetic response. We show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental grounds. A prescribed, non-dynamical $\kappa(x)$ in the field equation $G^{\mu\nu} = \kappa(x)T^{\mu\nu}$ clashes with the contracted Bianchi identity, $\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} \equiv 0$, forcing $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and thus violating local energy-momentum conservation. Making $\kappa(x)$ dynamical yields a scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that breaks the strong equivalence principle; Solar-System and pulsar-timing experiments already restrict $|\gamma - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, excluding any technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that any interface where $\kappa$ changes demands a $\delta$-function layer of stress-energy, while even steep continuous profiles are ruled out by torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements. Hence the concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and its scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data..</description>

      <title>Probing Right Handed Neutrino assisted Reheating with Gravitational Waves and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-instantaneous reheating period in the early Universe, where the inflaton field decays exclusively to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-like structure of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat Horndeski black holes is studied in detail. Focusing on the motion of massive neutral test particles, we construct the corresponding effective potential and classify the admissible types of orbits. The equations of motion are solved analytically, yielding trajectories expressed in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Multi-shell Dirac fermions in the Einstein--Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-fermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein--Dirac system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of previous studies of the Einstein--Dirac system are restricted to two neutral fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells, similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a spherically-symmetric system. Even single-shell multi-fermions exhibit a multi-peak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The behavior observed in our multi-shell model can be explained by interactions between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of inter-shell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Universal exponents of black hole phase transition in low-temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of black hole phase transitions in the low-temperature limit. Our results reveal that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$ represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions in low temperature and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Background as a Probe of the Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-point field-strength correlation $g^2 \langle G_{\mu\nu}^a(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s') \rangle$ in the Landau gauge in SU(2) and SU(3) quenched lattice QCD, as well as the gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\nu^b(s') \rangle$. The Landau-gauge gluon propagator $g^2 \langle A_\mu^a (s)A_\mu^a(s') \rangle$ is well described by the Yukawa-type function $e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ for $r=0.1-1.0~{\rm fm}$ in both SU(2) and SU(3) QCD. Next, motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in the QCD vacuum, we investigate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2\langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \perp)) \rangle$ ($\hat \perp$: unit vector on the $xy$-plane), and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r \hat \parallel) \rangle$ ($\hat \parallel$: unit vector on the $tz$-plane). These two quantities reproduce all the correlation of $g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries in the Landau gauge. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same-point correlation. In contrast, the parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region of $r \gtrsim 0.4~{\rm fm}$, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to a significant cancellation in the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} g^2\langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Finally, we decompose the field-strength correlation into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$ in the Landau gauge.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of circular unitary ensemble and their ratio: finite-size corrections and Riemann $\zeta$ zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for J\'{a}nossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs. Our result shows that the leading finite-$N$ correction in the gap-ratio distribution relative to the universal sine-kernel limit is of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4})$, reflecting a nontrivial cancellation of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ part present in the joint distributions of consecutive spacings. This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be given in completely distinct forms in different coordinates system. Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates transformation that connects the two metrics.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, the scotogenic model is constructed applying non invertible $Z_M$ symmetries. The stability of dark matter and the scotogenic structure of the neutrino mass matrix is achieved via the new non-group symmetry. The non-group Scotogenic model is given with minimalistic content giving a one-zero structure of the neutrino mass matrix, and numerical analysis of the lepton mixing angles and physics are presented. Other relevant constraints are also studied.</description>

      <title>Algebraically special perturbations of the Kerr black hole: a metric formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum mechanics can be considered to have begun with a search for wave equations corresponding to each intrinsic spin. However, relativistic quantum physics differs fundamentally from the non-relativistic wave mechanics. It requires a formalism allowing \ creation and destruction of particles. This gets proper treatment only in a framework called quantum field theory. This article is a semi-historic account of the intriguing new features which emerge as a part of quantum field theory. Such a discussion is impossible without a basic presentation of the formalism itself. Hence some mathematics is included in finer print. The article is directed mostly to those familiar with essential classical mechanics and basic quantum mechanics, though I strive to provide a flavour of the subject to the keenly interested non-physics reader.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.03780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study aspects of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) quantum gravity in two-dimensional nearly de Sitter (dS) spacetime, as well as pure de Sitter quantum gravity in three dimensions. These are each theories of boundary modes, which include a reparameterization field on each connected component of the boundary as well as topological degrees of freedom. In two dimensions, the boundary theory is closely related to the Schwarzian path integral, and in three dimensions to the quantization of coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. Using these boundary theories we compute loop corrections to the wavefunction of the universe, and investigate gravitational contributions to scattering. Along the way, we show that JT gravity in dS$_2$ is an analytic continuation of JT gravity in Euclidean AdS$_2$, and that pure gravity in dS$_3$ is a continuation of pure gravity in Euclidean AdS$_3$. We define a genus expansion for de Sitter JT gravity by summing over higher genus generalizations of surfaces used in the Hartle-Hawking construction. Assuming a conjecture regarding the volumes of moduli spaces of such surfaces, we find that the de Sitter genus expansion is the continuation of the recently discovered AdS genus expansion. Then both may be understood as coming from the genus expansion of the same double-scaled matrix model, which would provide a non-perturbative completion of de Sitter JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Emergent unitarity in de Sitter from matrix integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.12358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant as a model for de Sitter quantum gravity. We focus on the quantum mechanics of the model at past and future infinity. There is a Hilbert space of asymptotic states and an infinite-time evolution operator between the far past and far future. This evolution is not unitary, although we find that it acts unitarily on a subspace up to non-perturbative corrections. These corrections come from processes which involve changes in the spatial topology, including the nucleation of baby universes. There is significant evidence that this 1+1 dimensional model is dual to a 0+0 dimensional matrix integral in the double-scaled limit. So the bulk quantum mechanics, including the Hilbert space and approximately unitary evolution, emerge from a classical integral. We find that this emergence is a robust consequence of the level repulsion of eigenvalues along with the double scaling limit, and so is rather universal in random matrix theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct entangled microstates of a pair of holographic CFTs whose dual semiclassical description includes big bang-big crunch AdS cosmologies in spaces without boundaries. The cosmology is supported by inhomogeneous heavy matter and it partially purifies the bulk entanglement of two disconnected auxiliary AdS spacetimes. We show that the island formula for the fine grained entropy of one of the CFTs follows from a standard gravitational replica trick calculation. In generic settings, the cosmology is contained in the entanglement wedge of one of the two CFTs. We then investigate properties of the cosmology-to-boundary encoding map, and in particular, its non-isometric character. Restricting our attention to a specific class of states on the cosmology, we provide an explicit, and state-dependent, boundary representation of operators acting on the cosmology. Finally, under genericity assumptions, we argue for a non-isometric to approximately-isometric transition of the cosmology-to-boundary map for ``simple'' states on the cosmology as a function of the bulk entanglement, with tensor network toy models of our setup as a guide.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of codimension-one maximal volume and related geometric observables according to a pair of dynamical reference frames (i.e. observers) in asymptotically de Sitter universes in the presence of axion matter. This sources a Euclidean wormhole entangling the two universes, thereby changing the spacetime topology. The system is prepared in a two-copy Hartle-Hawking state by slicing a Euclidean wormhole. We derive the evolution of codimension-one observables anchored to the worldline reference frame in each universe. We investigate how the axion charge competes with the cosmological constant in the evolution of the observables. The maximal volume increases nearly exponentially for low axion charge, while it decreases to a vanishing value for the maximal axion charge allowed by de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid admits a natural modification that incorporates a chiral gravitational anomaly (also known as a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly) alongside the chiral current anomaly. This modification introduces in parallel a gravitational and gauge Chern-Simons terms in a manner analogous to the Jackiw-Pi Chern-Simons modification of gravity, and features an axion in fluid mechanics. As a result, flows of a spinless perfect fluid acquire spin through motion, with the spin being equal to the fluid helicity. Furthermore, spacetime curvature induces an analogue of the Mathisson-Papapetrou force and a geometric counterpart of the chiral magnetic effect.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>On the physical and mathematical foundations of quantum physics via functional integrals</title>

Abstract: In order to preserve the leading role of the action principle in formulating all field theories one needs quantum field theory, with the associated BRST symmetry, and Feynman-DeWitt-Faddeev-Popov ghost fields. Such fields result from the fibre-bundle structure of the space of histories, but the physics-oriented literature used them formally because a rigorous theory of measure and integration was lacking. Motivated by this framework, this paper exploits previous work of Gill and Zachary, where the use of Banach spaces for the Feynman integral was proposed. The Henstock-Kurzweil integral is first introduced, because it makes it possible to integrate functions like the exponential of (i times x squared). The Lebesgue measure on R(infinity) is then built and used to define the measure on every separable Hilbert space. The subsequent step is the construction of a new Hilbert space KS2, which contains square-integrable functions on R**n as a continuous dense embedding, and contains both the test functions and their dual, the Schwartz space of distributions, as continuous embeddings. This space allows us to construct the Feynman path integral in a manner that maintains its intuitive and computational advantages. We also extend this space to KS2[H], where H is any separable Banach space. Last, the existence of a unique universal definition of time, tau(h), that we call historical time, is proved. We use tau(h) as the order parameter for our construction of Feynman's time ordered operator calculus, which in turn is used to extend the path integral in order to include all time dependent groups and semigroups with a kernel.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo with Neural Network Quantum States for Yang-Mills Matrix Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the variational Monte Carlo method based on neural network quantum states, using a neural autoregressive flow architecture as our ansatz, to determine the ground state wave function of the bosonic SU($N$) Yang-Mills-type two-matrix model at strong coupling. Previous literature hinted at the inaccuracy of such an approach at strong coupling. In this work, the accuracy of the results is tested using lattice Monte Carlo simulations: we benchmark the expectation value of the energy of the ground state for system sizes $N$ that are beyond brute-force exact diagonalization methods. We observe that the variational method with neural network states reproduces the right ground state energy when the width of the network employed in this work is sufficiently large. We confirm that the correct result is obtained for $N=2$ and $3$, while obtaining a precise value for $N=4$ requires more resources than the amount available for this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate pure geometric $f(R)$ cosmology branes embedded in five-dimensional spacetime. The form of $f(R)$ is chosen as a polynomial. The Five-dimensional scalar curvature $R$ is assumed to be constant. Based on the value of the four-dimensional cosmological constant $\lambda_4$, the branes can be classified into Minkowski, de Sitter, and de anti-de Sitter cases. Solutions for each case can be calculated. These solutions are stable against linear tensor perturbations in all cases. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero mode of gravity can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode and one massive Kaluza-Klein mode can be localized on the brane. In the anti-de Sitter brane case, all massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be localized on the brane. The results of the analysis of tensor fluctuations are the same in both the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Effective Field Theory Approach to Entanglement Harvesting, Quantum Discord and Bell's Nonlocality Bound Near a Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes, as characterized by the Hawking effect and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can be treated as a compact object carrying nontrivial quantum information obscured behind the event horizon. Thus, the black hole may convey and retract its quantum information to the nearby quantum probes via the surrounding mediator fields. In this paper, we investigate the effects of a quantum black hole on the reduced states of a pair of static qubit-type Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors acting as a probe, using three complementary quantum information measures: concurrence characterizing entanglement harvesting, quantum discord, and Bell's nonlocality bound. This sheds light on the nature of the quantum state of the black holes. By treating the black hole as a tidally deformable thermal body under the quantum fluctuation of the mediator fields as observed in \cite{Goldberger:2019sya, goldberger2020virtual, biggs2024comparing}, we employ a post-Newtonian effective field theory (PN-EFT) to derive the reduced states of the UDW probes analytically. Based on this, we can easily obtain all three quantum information measures without encountering the complicated Matsubara sum of infinite thermal poles, as in the conventional approach based on quantum fields in curved spacetime. By tuning the relative strengths in the action of PN-EFT, we can extract the effects of the black hole on the entanglement, quantum correlation, and nonlocality bound of the UDW probe systems. Our PN-EFT approach can be extended to include the backreaction on the black holes in future studies by taking the higher-order PN corrections into account.</description>

      <title>Dependence of scalar matter vacuum energy, induced by a magnetic topological defect, on the coupling to space-time curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a topological defect modeled by a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter, and a generalized boundary condition of the Robin type is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature, only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the consistency of heterotic supergravity, where the $B$-field gauge transformation becomes anomalous due to the Green-Schwarz mechanism, under T-duality transformations. We establish that preserving T-duality necessitates an infinite tower of higher-derivative couplings proportional to $e^{-2\Phi}$. For spacetimes featuring a Killing self-dual circle, these couplings remain immune to quantum corrections. Leveraging S-duality in heterotic/type I string theory, we then identify the corresponding couplings in type I theory. Notably, our analysis reveals that standard S-duality transformations do not involve higher-derivative corrections. Building on this insight, we derive the explicit form of the effective action for type I theory at the $\alpha'$ order, adhering to a scheme that omits derivatives of the dilaton.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubbled-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time-scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the generalized Bondi-Sachs framework. We show that the Einstein equation is reduced to Laplacian equation on the celestial sphere. The solutions consist of two pairs of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes. We prove that the higher modes of one pair of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspectives of the asymptotic supertranslation charges. We verify that different modes of the soft hairs are distinct solutions which cannot be connected by diffeomorphism from the Weyl invariants associated to the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we proceed to investigate the Thurston geometries from the point of view of their Poisson-Lie (PL) T-dualizability. First of all, we find all subalgebras of Killing vectors that generate group of isometries acting freely and transitively on the three-dimensional target manifolds, where the Thurston metrics are defined. It is shown that three-dimensional Lie subalgebras are isomorphic to the Bianchi type algebras. We take the isometry subgroup of the metric as the first subgroup of Drinfeld double. In order to investigate the non-Abelian T-duality, the second subgroup must be chosen to be Abelian. Accordingly, the non-Abelian target space duals of these geometries are found via PL T-duality approach in the absence of $B$-field. We also comment on the conformal invariance conditions of the T-dual $\sigma$-models under consideration.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT), multi-stress tensor exchanges between probe operators give rise to the Virasoro identity conformal block, which is fixed by symmetry. The analogous object, and the corresponding organizing principles, in higher dimensions are less well understood. In this paper, we study the Virasoro identity OPE block, which is a bilocal operator that projects two primaries onto the conformal family of multi-stress tensor states. Generalizing a known construction of global OPE blocks, our formalism uses integrals over nested causal diamonds associated with two timelike-separated insertions. We argue that our construction is adaptable to higher dimensions, and use it to provide a new derivation of the single-stress tensor exchange contribution to a four-point correlator in both three and four dimensions, to leading order in the lightcone limit. We also comment on a potential description using effective reparametrization modes in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation VIII. P(Phi,2) quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential, called P(Phi,2). We consider only the finite volume case.
  The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonian renormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Stretched Horizon Dissipation and the Fate of Echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the dissipation of infalling particles near black holes under the assumption that the equivalence principle breaks down at the stretched horizon. This violation allows partial reflection of particles just outside the event horizon, as suggested by models such as the fuzzball and firewall proposals. We show that scattering with blue-shifted Hawking radiation leads to moderate dissipation when the particle energy is comparable to the Hawking temperature. The decay rate is independent of the Planck mass, and therefore gravitational wave echoes-arising from such partial reflection-may survive despite the presence of quantum gravitational effects. Our result is universal and does not rely on the detailed microphysics of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Assisted Fibre Inflation in Perturbative LVS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-field fibre inflation scenario in type IIB perturbative large volume compactifications, showing that the multi-field dynamics suppresses trans-Planckian displacements of the canonical inflaton. Considering a concrete K3-fibred Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold with $h^{1,1}({\rm CY})=3$ and having certain underlying symmetries, we show that the presence of multi-fibre moduli creates an assisted inflation scenario where multiple moduli collectively help in producing the cosmological observables consistent with the current experimental bounds. We further argue that individual field range excursions $(\Delta\phi_n)$ corresponding to each of the inflaton fields can be estimated as $\Delta\phi_n = \Delta\phi/\sqrt{n}$, where $\Delta\phi$ denotes the effective single-field inflaton range needed to generate the desired cosmological observables, and $n$ is the number of moduli assisting the multi-fibre inflation. We also present various numerical benchmark models consistently producing cosmological observables in light of the recent ACT experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider scenarios where Jackiw-Teitelboim black holes are attached to baths whose temperatures can be manipulated externally.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously identified integrable boundary states in ABJM theory are exclusively achiral. This paper presents the first chiral integrable boundary states in the $SU(4)$ alternating spin chain from the planar two-loop dilatation operator in the scalar sector. Utilizing a sufficient condition for the untwisted integrable condition, we identify specific two-site and four-site basis boundary states as chiral integrable states. Numerical evidence indicates that other basis states are unlikely to be chiral integrable. Furthermore, we compute the overlaps between these chiral integrable basis states and on-shell Bethe eigenstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the wavefunction coefficients for conformally coupled scalars in an FRW cosmology have been presented as a sum over amplitude-like functions known as {\it amplitubes}. In this work we extend this analysis to full {\it correlation functions}. Remarkably, the amplitube expansion of the correlator exhibits many vanishing contributions that are otherwise present in the expansion of the wavefunction. Moreover, while the wavefunction coefficients suffer from relative minus signs between terms, the surviving terms in correlation function do not. These observations point to a hidden simplicity in the structure of the correlation function compared to that of the wavefunction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and operators in $T\bar{T}$ deformed CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs are known to possess nonlocal conformal symmetries that do not act tractably on the undeformed local operators. In this paper, we explicitly construct two distinct classes of operators: (i) dressed operators, which are primary operators with respect to the nonlocal conformal symmetries, and (ii) physical operators, a new type of local operator we introduce. While the dressed operators preserve the conformal symmetry structure, they are themselves nonlocal. The physical operators, by contrast, are local and can be expressed in terms of the dressed operators. We calculate the two-point correlation functions of these operators in momentum space and find that our results align with both string theory predictions and field theory calculations. Additionally, we explore the relationship between physical operators and alternative operator definitions proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Zakharov stationary states for weak wave turbulence involve solving a leading-order kinetic equation. Recent calculations of higher-order corrections to this kinetic equation using the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral are reconsidered in terms of stationary states of a Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian. A non-perturbative relation closely related to the quantum mechanical Ehrenfest theorem is introduced and used to express the kinetic equation in terms of divergences of two-point expectation values in the limit of zero dissipation. Similar equations are associated to divergences in higher-order cumulants. It is additionally shown that the ordinary thermal equilibrium state is not actually a stationary state of the Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian, and a non-linear modification of dissipation is considered to remedy this.</description>

      <title>Extracting linear and nonlinear quasinormal modes from black hole merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, when two black holes merge they produce a rotating (Kerr) black hole remnant. According to perturbation theory, the remnant emits "ringdown" radiation: a superposition of exponentials with characteristic complex frequencies that depend only on the remnant's mass and spin. While the goal of the black hole spectroscopy program is to measure the quasinormal mode frequencies, a knowledge of their amplitudes and phases is equally important to determine which modes are detectable, and possibly to perform additional consistency checks. Unlike the complex frequencies, the amplitudes and phases depend on the properties of the binary progenitors, such as the binary mass ratio and component spins. In this paper we develop a fitting algorithm designed to reliably identify the modes present in numerical simulations and to extract their amplitudes and phases. We apply the algorithm to over 500 binary black hole simulations from the public SXS numerical relativity simulation catalog, and we present fitting formulas for the resulting mode amplitudes and phases as functions of the properties of the progenitors. Crucially, our algorithm allows for the extraction of not only prograde fundamental modes and overtones, but also retrograde modes and second-order modes. We unveil interesting relations for the amplitude ratios of different modes. The fitting code and interactive versions of some of the plots are publicly available. The results presented in this paper can be updated as more and better simulations become available.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued. As an application of our formula, we recover Sombra's bound on the height of resultants, in the classical case.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant (G) and the cosmological constant (\Lambda) flows with the momentum scale of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of inflaton decay rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}&lt;10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and set new targets for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors, provided that these achieve significantly enhanced experimental sensitivity, as current planned instruments do not yet possess sufficient sensitivity for detection.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Particles in finite volumes and a toy model of decaying neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the momentum spectra of particles confined to finite spatial volumes deviate from the continuous spectra used for unconfined particles. In this article, we consider real scalar particles confined to finite volumes with periodic boundary conditions, such that the particles' spectra are discrete. We directly compute the density matrices describing the decay processes $\phi \to \varphi^2$ and $\phi \to \varphi\chi\nu$, and subsequently derive expressions for the decay probabilities both for confined and unconfined particles. The latter decay process is used as a rough toy model for a neutron decaying into a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino. We propose that finite volume effects can have an impact on the outcomes of experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In addition, our findings at the toy model level suggest that taking into account possible initial correlations between neutrons and their daughter particles might be relevant as well.</description>

      <title>On the new way of symmetry breaking in scalar QED and the one-loop renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that single real scalar field does not allow gauge coupling to the Abelian vector field. Using the complex scalar model as a starting point, we construct the Abelian gauge model with two real scalars. The gauge transformations for the scalars look different (albeit equivalent) from the conventional sQED. Spitting the masses of the scalars, or the scalar self-couplings, or the nonminimal parameters of scalar-curvature interaction, we arrive at a qualitatively new way of gauge symmetry breaking. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique, we explore the one-loop renormalization of this new model in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions or interacting theories in spacetime dimensions lower than four. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting.
  The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow finds as fixed point those exact solution theories.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity $f_{\mathcal{R}}=1+c{\mathcal{R}} \phi^{n/2}$ with a kinetic mixing of the form $f_K = f_{\mathcal{R}}^m$ -- where $n=2$ and 4 and $0.5 \le m \le 10$ -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the $\phi^n$ potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of open confining strings in the large-Nc limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a thorough examination of the spectrum of the open confining string in 3+1 dimensions, commonly referred to as the open flux-tube, across various gauge groups of $SU(N_c)$. Our primary objective is to explore its behaviour as we approach the large-$N_c$ limit and the identification of possible world-sheet axion states. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis of the associated spectrum for $N_c=3, 4, 5, 6$. This marks the first systematic investigation of the open flux-tube spectrum within the context of the large-$N_c$ limit. More specifically, we analyse the spectra of flux-tubes that form between a static quark-antiquark pair, considering a significant number of radial excitations and eight irreducible representations characterized by the quantum numbers of angular momentum $\Lambda$, charge conjugation and parity $\eta_{CP}$ and the reflection symmetry $\epsilon$ for $\Lambda=0$. To this purpose we employ a diverse set of suitable operators, an anisotropic action, smearing techniques, and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. We compare our findings with predictions from the Nambu-Goto string model to assess potential tensions indicative of novel phenomena such as the existence of axion-like state along the flux-tube world-sheet. Notably, we provide undoubted evidence of the existence of a massive axion-like particle with the same mass as the corresponding axion extracted within the context of closed flux-tube. This strengthens the conjecture that the axion is a property of the world-sheet of the QCD string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>
