      <title>A new model of spontaneous scalarization of black holes induced by curvature and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model of black hole spontaneous scalarization that combines a scalar--Gauss--Bonnet interaction with a non-minimal coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field (a dark photon or an electromagnetic field). This construction generalizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature-induced and matter-induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to overcome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged, spherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially expands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair. Negative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with near-extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger scalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical procedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties of these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass thresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends sensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis also shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their Reissner--Nordstr\"om counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the usual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge behavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions that were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet models with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible configurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in strong gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmographical analysis of sign-switching dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>A mock data challenge for next-generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), a planned third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatory, will offer significantly improved sensitivity, introducing new challenges for data analysis and computing. To prepare for these demands, the ET community has initiated a series of Mock Data Challenges (MDCs) aimed at developing and testing analysis pipelines under realistic conditions. This paper presents the first ET MDC, providing an overview of the simulated dataset and the properties of the injected GW signals, with a focus on populations of compact binary coalescences and Gaussian noise. A tutorial is also included to guide users in accessing the data and performing basic analyses. This initial challenge establishes a baseline for future MDCs and supports collaborative efforts toward the successful scientific operation of the ET.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of metric theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional quantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low speed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian parameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among metric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as minimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that it is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory describes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to discriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single detection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination strategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper time corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between the energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed. It is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the success probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the highest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this, atomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ are independent of the model parameters that leads to unresolved degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

      <title>A covariant scalar-field framework for singularity resolution and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a covariant scalar-field framework that unifies the space-time singularity resolution with dynamic dark energy. The theory extends general relativity by introducing a scalar field $\Phi$ whose potential couples to the Lorentz-invariant quantity $X \equiv u_{\alpha} u_{\beta} T^{\alpha\beta}_{\mathrm{matter}}$, ensuring manifest covariance. The resulting density-responsive scalar energy $\rho_\Phi$ exhibits dual behavior: (i) in high-density regimes, it saturates at $\rho_\Phi \leq AM_P^4/2$, providing a Planck-scale upper bound on the total energy density that regularizes classical singularities; (ii) in low-density regimes, it approaches a constant $\rho_\Phi \to AM_U^4$, driving cosmic acceleration as dynamical dark energy. A natural renormalization group evolution with an anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.501$ connects the Planck scale to the meV dark energy scale without fine-tuning. The model makes distinctive, testable predictions: $w_0 \approx -0.99$ and $w_a \approx +0.03$, where the positive $w_a$ distinguishes it from $\Lambda$CDM and standard quintessence models. Despite the novel interaction terms, the fifth forces are suppressed by $\beta_{\rm eff} \propto 1/\rho_m^2$, yielding factors below $10^{-58}$ in laboratory environments, and ensuring compatibility with all precision gravity tests. This framework demonstrates how a single quantum field theory mechanism can simultaneously address UV singularities and IR dark energy, providing concrete predictions for future Stage-IV cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>From Explicit Diffeomorphism Breaking to Spontaneous Unimodularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution investigates modifications of General Relativity that allow or mimic energy nonconservation. We focus on Unimodular Gravity (UG), a theory that explicitly breaks diffeomorphism invariance, and show that it can lead to particle acceleration, opening the door to experimental constraints. We also argue that UG admits a well-posed initial value formulation, despite the presence of nondynamical structures. Finally, we introduce a simple model that spontaneously mimics UG, but in which a cosmological constant cannot arise as an integration constant.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Regular Spacetimes in the Effective Metric Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, significant effort has been directed towards developing various regularized models for compact objects. Recently, a new observable-based parametrization was introduced to account for black hole deformations in a model-independent fashion, referred to as the Effective Metric Description (EMD) \cite{Binetti:2022xdi, DelPiano:2023fiw, DelPiano:2024gvw, DelPiano:2024nrl}. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation of the regularity of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes by extending the EMD. We derive the conditions under which curvature scalars remain finite everywhere and the associated spacetime is geodesically complete. Our results are then used to classify the cores of regular spacetimes based on their asymptotic behavior near the origin. To illustrate our findings, we apply our regularity conditions to known black hole examples.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fisher information for a rotating BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic quantum metrology provides a framework within which we can quantify the quality of measurement and estimation procedures while accounting for both quantum and relativistic effects. The chief measure for describing such procedures is the Fisher information, which quantifies how sensitive a given estimation is to a variance of some underlying parameter. Recently, the Fisher information has been used to quantify the spacetime information accessible to two-level quantum particle detectors. We have previously shown that such a system is capable of discerning black hole mass for static black holes in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we extend these results to the astrophysically interesting case of rotating black holes and show that the Fisher information is also sensitive to the rotation of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the propagation properties of gravitational waves in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity theory. We introduce the scalar-tensor representation of the theory to make explicit the scalar degrees of freedom of the theory and obtain their equations of motion in a form decoupled from the metric tensor. Then, we introduce linear perturbations for the metric tensor and for the two scalar fields and obtain the propagation equations for these three quantities. We analyzed the theory both at non-linear and at linear level through the Newman-Penrose formalism so to find the polarization states. We show that the tensor modes propagate at the speed of light and feature the usual +- and x-polarization modes also present in General Relativity (GR), plus two additional polarization modes: a longitudinal mode and a breathing mode, described by the same additional degree of freedom. On the other hand, the theory features two additional scalar modes not present in GR. These modes are massive and, thus, propagate with a speed smaller than the speed of light in general. The masses of the scalar modes depend solely on the interaction potential between the two scalar fields in the theory, which suggests that one can always fine-tune the potential to make the scalar modes massless and reduce their propagation speed to the speed of light. Given the possibility of fine-tuning the theory to match the observational predictions of GR and in the absence of any measured deviations, these features potentially render the hybrid metric-Palatini theory unfalsifiable in the context of gravitational wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Enhanced Inertia in Curved Spacetimes: An ADM-Based Formalism with Multipole Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a covariant definition of an inertia tensor on spatial hypersurfaces in general relativity, constructed via integrals of geodesic distance functions using the exponential map. In the ADM 3+1 decomposition, we consider a spacelike slice (Sigma, gamma_ij) with induced metric gamma_ij, lapse N, shift N^i, and a mass-energy density rho(x) on Sigma. At each point p in Sigma, we define a Riemannian inertia tensor I_p(u,v) as an integral over Sigma involving geodesic distances and the exponential map. This reduces to the Newtonian inertia tensor in the flat-space limit. An expansion in Riemann normal coordinates shows curvature corrections involving the spatial Riemann tensor. We apply this to two cases: (i) for closed or open FLRW slices, a spherical shell of matter has an effective moment of inertia scaled by (chi_0 / sin(chi_0))^2 &gt; 1 or (chi_0 / sinh(chi_0))^2 &lt; 1, confirming that positive curvature increases and negative curvature decreases inertia; and (ii) for a slowly rotating relativistic star (Hartle--Thorne approximation), we recover the known result: I = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) exp(-(nu + lambda)/2) [omega_bar(r)/Omega] r^4 dr. In the Newtonian limit, this becomes I_Newt = (8 pi / 3) integral from 0 to R of rho(r) r^4 dr. We show that I_p reproduces these corrections and encodes post-Newtonian contributions consistent with Thorne's and Dixon's multipole formalisms. We also discuss the relation to Geroch--Hansen moments and propose an extension to dynamical slices involving extrinsic curvature. This work thus provides a unified, geometric account of inertia and multipole structure in general relativity, bridging Newtonian intuition and relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter's Gravitational Effects Locally with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to assist in the Earth's gravity or gravitational waves detection. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravity effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of a quantum-corrected RN black hole on the shadow using Perlick methodology and strong-field gravitational lensing using Tsukamoto's approach. Our analysis shows that even at extreme charge, the predicted shadow remains within the observational bounds set by the Event Horizon Telescope for both M87* and Sgr A*. The charge significantly influences the deflection angle near the photon sphere, while its effect diminishes at larger distances. In contrast, the quantum correction parameter, $\mathrm{a}$, exhibits negligible impact at the current observational scale. However, a slight increase in the shadow radius and a corresponding decrease in the strong deflection angle are observed as, $\mathrm{a}$, increases. These results underscore the subtle but theoretically consistent role of quantum corrections in black hole observables.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic and Strong Coupling Models in Weyl-Type $f(Q,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the cosmological implications of Weyl-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity, a modified gravitational theory formulated from Weyl geometry. The nonmetricity scalar $Q$ is coupled to the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor. We analyze two models based on the logarithmic and strong coupling form of the function $f(Q,T)$. The corresponding field equations are then solved numerically after reformulating the system in terms of redshift. We used combined dataset from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon$^+$ supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and performed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the model parameters. Using the constrained parameters, the geometrical and dynamical aspects of the models are analyzed. The results successfully describe a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion for both the models. The models mostly exhibit quintessence-like behavior and asymptotically approach the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at late times. The calculated age of the Universe from each model aligns with constraints from Planck and stellar age data. The violation of the strong energy condition and the satisfaction of null energy condition and dominant energy conditions are shown.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-rays are charged particles moving in magnetic fields. They not only emit well-known synchrotron photons but also gravitational radiation. We clarify the characteristics of the gravitational wave signal in this specific situation and underline some unexpected features. A phenomenological approximation for the radiated power is given. We derive the shape and peaking frequency of the associated stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves for both electrons and protons, either of galactic or extra-galactic origin.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Analysis of $f(R,\Sigma, T)$ Gravity via $O_m(z)$ Reconstruction: Implications into Dark Energy Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the cosmological implications of $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity by reconstructing the Hubble parameter from a logarithmic parameterization of the $O_m(z)$ diagnostic. Our approach offers a model-independent way to probe the nature of dark energy and differentiate it from a cosmological constant. We derive the field equations for $f(R,\Sigma,T) = R + \Sigma + 2\pi\eta T$ within the homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. A comprehensive analysis of key physical parameters, including the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega(z)$, the $(\omega-\omega')$-plane, the squared sound speed $\vartheta^2$, and various energy conditions (Null, Dominant, Strong), is presented. Our findings reveal a dynamic EoS parameter that consistently remains within the quintessence regime ($-1 &lt; \omega &lt; -1/3$), approaching $\omega = -1$ in the far future, thereby avoiding phantom behavior and maintaining the weak energy condition. The model successfully reproduces the cosmic transition from deceleration to acceleration, as indicated by the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ crossing zero. While the model aligns well with observational data for cosmic expansion, the analysis of $\vartheta^2$ indicates classical instability, a point requiring further theoretical refinement. Overall, this work demonstrates the viability of $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity as a framework capable of describing the universe's accelerated expansion, consistent with current cosmological observations, while offering a dynamic alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation signatures in the low-energy sector of Ho\v{r}ava gravity from black hole shadow observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Ho\v{r}ava gravity model and EHT observations of supermassive black holes (BHs) to investigate signatures of Lorentz violation in real astrophysical environments. The Lorentz violation in the rotating Ho\v{r}ava BH spacetime are confined to the strong gravitational field region, being induced by the BH's rotation. Due to the non-separability of the photon motion equations in this spacetime, we employed a numerical backward ray-tracing method to generate shadow images for various BH parameters. Subsequently, we extracted coordinate positions characterizing the shadow shape from high-pixel images to evaluate the parameter space of the BH. When evaluating M87*, Lorentz violation can occur with arbitrary strength. However, for Sgr A*, we can impose certain parameter constraints on Lorentz violation. These constraints depend on the BH's spin. If future observations confirm Sgr A*'s spin parameter less than 0.81 at maximum inclination, current EHT results would challenge general relativity and support Lorentz violation in low-energy regimes.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Origins of Gravitational Potentials in Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most astrophysical systems (except for very compact objects such as, e.g., black holes and neutron stars) in our universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness parameter. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of the compactness -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant G. It then follows that large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with virialized systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where the compactness is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. This observation, largely overlooked in the literature, explains why the universe is not dominated by relativistic, compact objects and connects the low entropy of the observable universe to underlying microphysics. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of compactness from G applies specifically to entire, virialized, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium through self-gravity and microphysical processes. In contrast, arbitrary non-virialized subsystems (e.g., a piece cut from a planet) do not exhibit this property.</description>

      <title>Regular Power-Maxwell Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of regular, spherically symmetric spacetimes in nonlinear electrodynamics that are asymptotically dynamical but not de Sitter, exhibiting power-law Maxwell behavior at infinity. Starting from magnetic solutions, we demonstrate that the weak energy condition is satisfied, while the dominant energy condition is also fulfilled. These configurations are extended to include regular black holes, with their existence conditions and global structures analyzed via novel Penrose diagrams. Through FP duality, we obtain corresponding electric solutions and establish uniqueness criteria. However, in square-root--Maxwell theory, electric duals are absent; we address this by introducing an auxiliary scalar field formulation that restores duality and yields a generalized transformation. We further investigate the effective metric governing light propagation, finding that it remains regular for some magnetic cases (in the absence of black holes) but becomes singular for electric ones. Furthermore, we identify spacelike photon trajectories in these spacetimes, signaling the existence of causality issues. Finally, we derive the first law and Smarr formula, showing the existence of thermodynamically stable black holes with positive heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production sourced by spectator scalar fields during inflation. These fields, while not driving cosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally satisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power spectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum spans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with amplitudes ranging from $\Omega_{\text{GW}}h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$ depending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy spectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale $H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and ground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints on spectator field parameters. GW-induced limits on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$) require $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.61 H_I$, stronger than CMB isocurvature bounds alone ($m_\chi \gtrsim 0.54 H_I$). The non-observation of primordial B-modes by \textit{Planck} provides stronger constraints $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.66 H_I$, with projected LiteBIRD sensitivity potentially reaching $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.70 H_I$. This mechanism enables a unique multi-messenger probe of beyond the Standard Model physics during inflation, providing simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through current and next-generation GW experiments.</description>

Abstract: Some recent work has postulated the existence of an "observer" for a consistent definition of subregion algebras in gravitational universes. The subregion algebras consist of operators dressed to this "observer" and are typically Type II von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless, as opposed to standard physical systems, such an "observer" was postulated to have a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\text{obs}}$ linear in phase space variable. This linear form suggests that the complete dynamics of such an "observer" should also be controlled by an external system or some underlying degrees of freedom within the system. In this paper, we show that this is exactly the case in the island model. In the island model, we have a gravitational asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime coupled with a non-gravitational bath, and the diffeomorphism symmetries in the gravitational AdS are spontaneously broken due to the bath coupling. In this setup, the "observer" is constructed using the Goldstone vector field associated with the spontaneously broken diffeomorphism symmetry, and the external system that also controls the dynamics of the "observer" is the non-gravitational bath. The basic consistency of the entanglement wedge reconstruction requires operators in the entanglement island to be dressed to this "observer". Thus, we establish the result that entanglement islands correspond to emergent Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebras from the holographic dual perspective. This result relies on assuming the geometric modular flow conjecture. Our study also raises a question for earlier constructions of Type II$_{1}$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Mass of a Hypothetical Secondary Black Hole in M87 with the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers, each hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are thought to form SMBH binaries. Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about 11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass of a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To constrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary black hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \leq 1$, and the length of the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three constraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is expected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can induce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$. If either of the EAVN-detected periods ($T$) corresponds to the binary's orbital period, the allowed range of $q$ is $6.9 \times 10^{-3} \le q \le 4.2 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 11$ years, and $3.7\times 10^{-2} \le q \le 1$ for $T \approx 0.9$ years. VLBI astrometric monitoring of the jet base of M87 is essential to explore the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Relativistic Strings Propagate Without Geometric Baggage?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal and dynamically consistent formulation of non-relativistic bosonic string theory in a Newton-Cartan (NC) background. Starting from a reparametrization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, we develop the Hamiltonian framework and perform a complete Dirac constraint analysis. The resulting structure exhibits first-class constraints that generate worldsheet diffeomorphisms, confirming the internal gauge consistency of the model. Using an interpolating Lagrangian, we derive a Polyakov-type action that enables a direct comparison with symmetry-based constructions known as gauging the algebra (GTA) approaches, which promote non-relativistic symmetry algebras to local symmetries. In contrast to GTA formulations, which require additional background fields to achieve algebraic closure, our model derives all necessary geometric data dynamically from the string evolution itself. This establishes that standard Newton-Cartan geometry is sufficient to support consistent non-relativistic string dynamics. Our results provide a conceptually transparent and technically robust foundation for future studies of non-relativistic string theory in curved backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\Lambda$CDM extensions in light of re-analyzed CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last years with the increasing precision in cosmological observations we have been able to establish an standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM, but also find some tensions between cosmological probes that are difficult to explain within the context of this model. We tested several phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM with the newest datasets from the chain CMB+BAO+SNIa, to see whether they are able to alleviate the aforementioned tensions. We find that when the updated version of the Planck CMB likelihood (PR4 LoLLiPoP and HiLLiPoP), with respect to the more used likelihoods (PR4 CamSpec and PR3), is considered, the lensing anomaly is reduced, and the preference for $A_L&gt;1$ and $\Omega_k&lt;0$ is less significant. From the CMB+BAO+SNIa dataset, in the context of the parameterization $w_0w_a$CDM we find a preference for a time-evoling dark energy over the rigid cosmological constant which is consistent with the most recent results from DESI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Metric-affine cosmological models and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. Part II: Variational bootstrapping of the $\Lambda$CDM model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The method of variational bootstrapping, based on canonical variational completion, allows one to construct a Lagrangian for a physical theory depending on two sets of field variables, starting from a guess of the field equations for only one such set. This setup is particularly appealing for the construction of modified theories of gravity, since one can take lessons from GR for an "educated guess" of the metric field equations; the field equations for the other fields are then fixed by the obtained Lagrangian (up to terms that are completely independent from the metric tensor). In the present paper, we apply variational bootstrapping to determine metric-affine models which are, in a variational sense, closest to the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. Starting from an "educated guess" that formally resembles the Einstein field equations with a cosmological "constant" (actually, a scalar function built from the metric and the connection) and a dark matter term, the method then allows to find "corrected" metric equations and to "bootstrap" the connection field equations. Lagrangians obtained via this method, though imposing some restricting criteria, still encompass a wide variety of metric-affine models. In particular, they allow for a subclass of quadratic metric-affine theories restricted to linear terms in the curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schr\"odinger wavefunction representation which we argue to be less appealing. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity, plausibly with a quantum Einstein equation suggested.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity effects on particle creation and evaporation in a non-commutative black hole via mass deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a gravitational non-commutative black hole by gauging the de Sitter SO(4,1) group and employing the Seiberg-Witten map. Specifically, we examine modifications of non-commutativity represented through mass deformation. Initially, we address modifications to Hawking radiation for bosonic particle modes by analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetimes. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, showing how $\Theta$ introduces a correction to the amplitude associated with particle creation. Additionally, we derive the power spectrum and the Hawking temperature within this framework. We also derive Hawking radiation from a tunneling perspective, leading to expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density. A similar analysis is performed for fermion particles. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical expression for black hole evaporation lifetime and compare our results with recent estimates of non-commutativity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Determining parameters of Kerr-Newman black holes by shadow observation from finite distance and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass $M$, specific angular momentum $a$, electric charge $Q$, inclination angle $i$, and distance $r_o$. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters $(a/M, Q/M, i)$ can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance $r_o$ is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, gravitational memory describes the lasting change in the separation and relative velocity of freely falling detectors after the passage of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we elucidate the relation between Bondi-Metzner-Sachs transformations at future null infinity and the description of gravitational memory in local synchronous coordinates, commonly used in GW detectors like LISA. We show that gravitational memory corresponds to large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, such as volume-preserving spatial rescalings. We reproduce the associated soft theorems for scattering amplitudes. Finally, we derive novel soft theorems for equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, which are recognized as the flat space analogues of inflationary consistency relations with a soft tensor mode. These relations provide a pathway toward uncovering deeper connections between gravitational memory and cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter, and the science potential will be greatly enhanced by the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, which are expected to detect BNS signals with order-of-magnitude improvements in duration, detection rates, and signal strength. However, the resulting computational demands for analyzing such prolonged signals pose a critical challenge that existing Bayesian methods cannot feasibly address in the 3G era. To bridge this critical gap, we demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compression of the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inference that can deliver results in seconds. The optimized computational cost of BNS signal analysis with our framework shows that machine learning has the potential to be an indispensable tool for future catalog-level BNS analyses, paving the way for large-scale investigations of BNS-related physics across the 3G observational landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures beyond Newton: exploring hierarchical three-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical three-body systems offer a compelling framework to explore the subtle interplay between Newtonian and relativistic gravitational effects in astrophysical environments. In this work, we investigate post-Newtonian corrections to the periastron shift within such systems, focusing on the impact of orbital eccentricity and relativistic modifications to the center of mass. Modeling the secondary body's influence as a quadrupolar perturbation, we rigorously compare Newtonian, Schwarzschild, and post-Newtonian quadrupolar contributions to orbital precession. Our analysis demonstrates that Newtonian quadrupolar effects could be observable in the orbit of the S87 star around Sagittarius A* if an intermediate-mass black hole is present. Additionally, post-Newtonian quadrupolar corrections, though subtle, may notably influence the dynamics of small Solar System bodies in the presence of massive companions. These findings provide critical insights into detecting relativistic corrections in astrophysical systems with current high-precision instruments, such as GRAVITY. By bridging classical and relativistic dynamics, this study enhances our understanding of gravitational interactions in multi-body systems and paves the way for testing general relativity in the complex gravitational fields of galactic nuclei and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Dyonic regular black bounce solutions in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores dyonic black bounce (BB) solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields (SFs). Previous research has employed NLED and SFs to obtain BB solutions in GR; however, these solutions typically assume the presence of either magnetic monopoles or electric charges exclusively as components of the Maxwell-Faraday tensor. In this study, we examine static and spherically symmetric BB solutions that incorporate both magnetic and electric components, forming what are known as dyon solutions. A dyon is a particle characterized by the coexistence of both magnetic and electric charges. We determine the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential that produce these solutions and analyze the associated gravitational configurations, focusing on horizons, the behavior of the metric function, and spacetime regularity as described by the Kretschmann scalar. Notably, we present the first BB solution derived from the coupling of a linear electromagnetic Lagrangian and a scalar field with an associated potential as the matter source. This work broadens the class of non-singular geometries in the literature and opens new avenues for investigating dyonic BB solutions within the context of other modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We present a new exact solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations which represents a rotating black hole with both electric and magnetic charges immersed in a universe which itself is also rotating and magnetized, i.e. the dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe. We show that the solution is completely regular and free of any type of singularity; then we analyze its physical properties, such as the ergoregions and the shape of the event horizons. Finally we present the extremal near horizon geometry of the metric and study its entropy via the Kerr/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>A parametrized spin-precessing inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for tests of general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs) provides a unique arena to test general relativity (GR) in the dynamical, strong-field regime. To this end, we present pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform model for BBHs in quasicircular orbits, built within the effective-one-body formalism. Compared to its predecessor, pSEOBNRv4HM, our model introduces parametrized deviations from GR not only in the plunge-merger-ringdown stages, but also in the inspiral phase through modifications to the conservative dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates, for the first time, spin-precession effects. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR using current and future gravitational-wave observations. We validate pSEOBNRv5PHM through Bayesian parameter estimation, focusing on the quasinormal-mode frequency and damping time of the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$ mode. Our analysis of synthetic signals from numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of highly precessing BH mergers shows that, while pSEOBNRv5PHM correctly recovers consistency with GR, neglecting spin precession can lead to false detections of deviations from GR even at current detector sensitivity. Conversely, when analyzing a synthetic signal from a NR simulation of a binary boson-star merger, the model successfully identifies a deviation from a GR BBH signal. Finally, we reanalyze 12 events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Using a hierarchical combination of these events, we constrain fractional deviations in the frequency and damping time of the $(2,2,0)$ quasinormal-mode to $\delta f_{220}=0.00_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ and $\delta \tau_{220}=0.15_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ at 90% credibility. These results are consistent with those from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, which did not account for spin-precession effects.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity with DESI DR2 BAO and GRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $f\left( Q\right) $-theory for the description of dark energy with a non-trivial connection defined in the non-coincident gauge. The resulting field equations form a two-scalar-field, quintom-like gravitational model. For the power-law model $f\left( Q\right) \simeq Q^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$, we construct an analytic expression for the dynamical evolution of dark energy, which depends on the parameter $n$. We constrain this dark energy model using the the baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and gamma-ray bursts. The cosmological data provides $n\simeq0.33$. The $f\left( Q\right) $-model challenges the $\Lambda$CDM by providing a smaller value for $\chi_{\min}^{2}$. Although the Akaike Information Criterion indicates that the two cosmological models fit the data from the Pantheon+, the cosmic chronometers and the baryonic acoustic oscillators in a similar way, when the gamma-ray bursts are introduced there is weak evidence in favor of the $f\left( Q\right) $-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that one can derive consistent thermodynamical expressions in the Lorentzian Taub--NUT spacetime keeping the Misner-string singularities and taking into account their contributions in the Komar integrals. We show how the same results are obtained when the Mister-string singularities are removed by using Misner's procedure because, even though the complete spacetime has no such singularities anymore, they are unavoidable in all spacelike hypersurfaces which are used in the Komar integrals. Different choices of hypersurfaces may contain different strings and lead to different physics, though.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian equations of motion of quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute explicitly the equations of motion of the Hamiltonian formulation of quadratic gravity. This is the theory with the most general Lagrangian with terms of quadratic order in the curvature tensor. We employ the symbolic computational tool Cadabra. We present the linearized version of the equations of motion, performing the longitudinal-transverse decomposition. We compare the linear equations with the covariant field equations, finding that, if general-relativity terms are active, the linear Hamiltonian formulation is valid only if the perturbative spatial metric is traceless, a condition that can be freely imposed by recurring to an arbitrary function. We apply the equations of motion on homogeneous and isotropic configurations, finding explicit solutions.</description>

      <title>A viable wormhole model in a five-dimensional spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper generalizes two of the author's earlier wormhole solutions that are characterized by an extra spatial dimension. This paper adds the assumption that the components of the line element are functions not only of the radial coordinate $r$ but of the extra coordinate $l$ as well, resulting in a significant generalization. It is shown that the throat of the wormhole can be threaded with ordinary matter and that the unavoidable violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the extra dimension. To be consistent with string theory, we also assume that this extra dimension has a small magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild perturbations in higher derivative gravity theories in $D$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Kerr-Schild perturbations of the ghost-free generic non-local gravity theory constructed infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we present, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>HBAR entropy of Infalling Atoms into a GUP-corrected Schwarzschild Black Hole and equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by a two-level atom freely falling into a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP)-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We derive analytic expressions for the atom's excitation probability with simultaneous emission of a scalar quantum and observe that it satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle when compared to the excitation probability induced by a uniformly accelerating mirror, motivated by studies [10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.071301] and [10.1073/pnas.1807703115]. We further demonstrate that this equivalence persists for a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Adopting an open-quantum-system framework, we then compute the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for the GUP-corrected spacetime and find that it reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, with corrections characteristic of GUP effects. These results underline the robustness of thermal radiation processes near horizons and the universality of entropy corrections in quantum-improved black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is intended to serve as a reference for conventions used in the literature on string compactifications, and how to move between them, collected in a single and easy-to-find place, using type IIB as an illustrative example. We hope it may be useful to beginners in the field and busy experts. E.g. string constructions proposed to address the moduli stabilisation problem are generically in regions of parameter space at the boundaries of control, so that consistent use of $2\pi$'s and frame conventions can be pivotal when computing their potentially dangerous corrections.</description>

      <title>Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomaly and gravitational pair production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter\textendash dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and, for the first time, numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions, improving upon earlier works that relied on approximations. We perform a comprehensive MCMC analysis using a combination of datasets including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results show a clear preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling, overcoming previous upper-bound-only constraints due to improved numerical accuracy and data precision. This preference is primarily driven by the late-time ISW effect. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$_0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields strong statistical support over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta{\rm AIC} = -0.75, -2.41$ respectively. If future data further supports a fifth force in the dark sector, non-linear structure formation could offer additional observational tests of such long-range interactions. This work also remains consistent with recent DESI observations of evolving dark energy, with the effective dark energy equation of state crossing the phantom divide around redshift $z \sim 0.5$, a feature that emerges naturally in our framework due to the scalar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Entanglement Mediated By General Relativistic Frame Dragging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects make the potential bias between the true and false vacua dependent on the temperature and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $\sigma$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $\sigma$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense.</description>

      <title>Instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces from initial data set symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\tilde{\Sigma},h_{ab},K_{ab})$ be an initial data set and let $x^a$ be a symmetry vector of $\tilde{\Sigma}$. Consider a MOTS $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$ and let the symmetry vector be decomposable along the unit normal to $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$, and along $\mathcal{S}$. In this note we present some basic results with regards to the stability of $\mathcal{S}$. The vector decomposition allows us to characterize the instability of $\mathcal{S}$ by the nature of the zero set of the normal component to $\mathcal{S}$ and the divergence of the component along $\mathcal{S}$. Further observations are made under the assumption of $\mathcal{S}$ having a constant mean curvature, and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ being an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Graviton Scattering on Gravitational Atoms: Relic Graviton Shot Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of a graviton on a gravitational atom. By gravitational atom we mean a quantum mechanical system of a gravitational (bound) state of two massive particles, with possibly some boundary conditions (such as bouncing on a table or hanging as a pendulum). We demonstrate the unexpected fact, that the total absorption cross section is universal, it is independent of both the mass of the gravitationally bound particle or of the mass providing the binding potential. We find that the total absorption cross-section is simply proportional to the Planck area, multiplied by a dimensionless, numerical factor. We speculate about the potential for detection of relic gravitons shot noise.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Singularities from Holographic Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a second law of complexity, we prove a black hole singularity theorem. By introducing the notion of trapped extremal surfaces, we show that their existence implies null geodesic incompleteness inside globally hyperbolic black holes. We also demonstrate that the vanishing of the growth rate of the volume of extremal surfaces provides a sharp diagnostic of the black hole singularity. In static, uncharged, spherically symmetric spacetimes, this corresponds to the growth rate of spacelike extremal surfaces going to zero at the singularity. In charged or rotating spacetimes, such as the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, we identify novel timelike extremal surfaces that exhibit the same behavior at the timelike singularity.</description>

      <title>Holographic Conformal Anomaly and a-Theorem in 5D Scalar-Tensor Theories from Heterotic Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories-one Lovelock-Horndeski type and one Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet-obtained via a unified mechanism for Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional heterotic string effective action. In the Lovelock-Horndeski case, we also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles and establish a holographic a-theorem. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms, and show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic explorations of regular black holes in pure gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently established in \textit{Phys.Lett.B 861 (2025) 139260} that regular, asymptotically flat black holes exist in pure gravity theories in dimension greater than four. We extend this result to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes and perform bottom-up holographic explorations: Hawking-Page phase transitions, quasinormal modes of black holes providing decay times of excitations in the finite temperature conformal field theory and U-shaped string probes leading to the quark-antiquark potential in the dual field theory. The gravitational action contains a bared, negative cosmological constant and an Einstein-Hilbert term, supplemented by an infinite series of higher-curvature terms of the family known as Quasi-topological (QT) Lagrangians, leading to a lapse function in terms of infinite series which can be resumed to an analytic function for different coupling choices. The QT terms are defined as those satisfying a Birkhoff's theorem and possessing a holographic c-function, and exist at all orders in the curvature, for arbitrary dimension greater than four. Besides presenting the general formulae, we explore the physics of three specific cases leading to Hayward, Dymnikova and Bardeen-like regular black holes. We also found the field redefinition that permits recasting the $\alpha'^3 W^4$ correction of Type IIB supergravity on $\mathcal{A}_5\times S^5$ as a series of QT terms. Before finishing, beyond holography, we also provide an extended thermodynamic setup, that via variations of the dimensionful $\alpha$ and $L$, allow obtaining the Euler relation between finite thermodynamical quantities for the black hole of the theory.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Quantum Gravity in a Closed Lorentzian Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how meaningful physical predictions can arise in nonperturbative quantum gravity in a closed Lorentzian universe. In such settings, recent developments suggest that the quantum gravitational Hilbert space is one-dimensional and real for each $\alpha$-sector, as induced by spacetime wormholes. This appears to obstruct the conventional quantum-mechanical prescription of assigning probabilities via projection onto a basis of states. While previous approaches have introduced external observers or augmented the theory to resolve this issue, we argue that quantum gravity itself contains all the necessary ingredients to make physical predictions. We demonstrate that the emergence of classical observables and probabilistic outcomes can be understood as a consequence of partial observability: physical observers access only a subsystem of the universe. Tracing out the inaccessible degrees of freedom yields reduced density matrices that encode classical information, with uncertainties exponentially suppressed by the environment's entropy. We develop this perspective using both the Lorentzian path integral and operator formalisms and support it with a simple microscopic model. Our results show that quantum gravity in a closed universe naturally gives rise to meaningful, robust predictions without recourse to external constructs.</description>

      <title>Can metric-affine gravity be saved?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons in the spectrum of propagating particle states, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>
