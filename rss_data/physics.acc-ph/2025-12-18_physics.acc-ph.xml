      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Modern UX Design and Particle Accelerator Control Room Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerator control systems often represent relatively complex and safety-sensitive human-machine interfaces within process control industries. These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools.</description>

      <title>3D Printing as a Rapid Prototyping Approach for Novel RF Cavity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D-printing of radiofrequency (RF) cavity resonators could provide a cost-effective solution that enables rapid prototyping and design flexibility compared to traditional fabrication of full-metal cavities. In this work, the feasibility of fabrication of a useful multi-mode GHz cavity is explored. Two kinds of plastics, two slicing approaches and two metal coating techniques were used to build a series of clamped cavities with thin inner copper surface on otherwise 3D printed plastic surface. The cavities were then bench-tested to identify spatial field distributions, operating frequencies and quality factors (Q-factor). Pros and cons of the used fabrication approaches were identified and understood, and the performance of longitudinally sliced painted cavity design demonstrated considerable practicality of 3D-printing approach in designing rf systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based prediction of magnet errors in storage ring light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnet errors in storage rings significantly degrade beam performance, impacting the brightness and stability of the light source. Therefore, beam-based correction is crucial for the safe operation of machines and the stability of radiated photons. Unlike traditional correction methods such as linear optics from closed orbit, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) framework to directly predict quadrupole/sextupole gradient errors and misalignment from beam position monitor-measured optics functions and closed-orbit distortion data. Based on a four-bend achromat storage ring lattice, we generate training datasets through ELEGANT numerical simulations and compare regression performance of Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Densely Connected Convolutional Network. Results demonstrate that ML models can effectively predict magnet errors and reconstruct ideal optics. This approach offers a novel strategy for accelerating storage ring commissioning and optimization, online diagnostics, and dynamic compensation for next-generation diffraction-limited rings.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Pressure Control in MuVacAS via Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of nuclear fusion requires materials that can withstand extreme conditions. The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the inferred beam energy.</description>
