      <title>How fast extinction occurs in bisexual populations with size-depending mating dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that extinction in a bisexual population is certain, we study a way to approximate the time when this extinction occurs. Our study is based on standard tools from Extreme Value Theory, which in practice are very easy to implement. We present the theoretical results derived from our study and provide a few numerical examples of such results.</description>

      <title>Impact of complex spatial population structure on early and long-term adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exploration of rugged fitness landscapes by spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph, connected by migrations. In the rare migration regime, we find that finite structures can adapt more efficiently than very large ones, especially in high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Furthermore, we show that, in most landscapes, migration asymmetries associated with some suppression of natural selection allow the population to reach higher fitness peaks first. In this sense, suppression of selection can make early adaptation more efficient. However, the time it takes to reach the first fitness peak is then increased. We also find that suppression of selection tends to enhance finite-size effects. We extend our study to frequent migrations, suggesting that our conclusions hold in this regime. We then investigate the impact of spatial structure with rare migrations on long-term evolution by studying the steady state of the population. For this, we define an effective population size for the steady-state distribution. We find that suppression of selection is associated to reduced steady-state effective population sizes, and reduced average steady-state fitnesses.</description>

      <title>Biological barriers to forest pest invasions: A novel host tree slows mountain pine beetle range expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following widespread outbreaks across western North America, mountain pine beetle recently expanded its range from British Columbia into Alberta. However, mountain pine beetle's eastward expansion across Canada has stalled unexpectedly, defying predictions of rapid spread through jack pine, a novel host tree. This study investigates the underlying causes of this deceleration using an integrative approach combining statistical modeling, simulations, and experimental data. We find that the slow spread is primarily due to mountain pine beetle's difficulty in finding and successfully attacking jack pine trees, rather than issues with reproduction or larval development. The underlying mechanism impeding beetle range expansion has been hypothesized to be lower pine volumes in eastern forests, which are primarily a consequence of lower stem density. However, our analysis suggests that jack pine's phenotype itself is the primary impediment. We propose that jack pine's smaller size, thinner phloem, and lower monoterpene concentrations result in weaker chemical cues during the host-finding and mass-attack stages of MPB's life cycle, ultimately leading to fewer successful attacks. These findings suggest a reduced risk of further eastward spread, but should be interpreted cautiously due to enormous policy implications and the inherent limitations of ecological forecasting.</description>

      <title>An assessment of Alberta's strategy for controlling mountain pine beetle outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Canadian province of Alberta spent over 500 million dollars on controlling mountain pine beetle populations, but did it work? Using a statistical modeling framework coupled with long-term field data, we examined how direct control measures, severe winters, and host-tree depletion shaped the trajectory of Alberta's mountain pine beetle outbreak between 2009 and 2020. Simulations suggest that control efforts reduced total tree mortality by 79% (95% predictive interval: 58--89%) and prevented 1.8 (0.91--4.1) trees per hectare from being killed from 2010--2020. Although cold winters had little effect on overall damage, they acted synergistically with control to end the outbreak, causing population collapse circa 2020. This synergy supports a "wait it out" strategy of mountain pine beetle management, where moderate control effort is applied until an extreme weather event delivers the final blow. Any effects of host-tree depletion via beetle attack were negligible. From an economic perspective, removing one infestation tree -- at an approximate cost of 320 CAD -- prevented the loss of roughly six (2.6--15) trees, demonstrating the potential for long-term cost-effectiveness. Our results further indicate that future outbreaks may vary widely in severity due to environmental stochasticity, with potential damage in a no-control scenario ranging from 0.41 to 9.7 trees per hectare killed (over a hypothetical 11-year period). An alternative model predicts an even wider range of outcomes: 1--40 trees per hectare. These findings highlight not only the potential of sustained control efforts in mitigating forest pest outbreaks, but also the inherent uncertainty in long-term ecological forecasting.</description>
