      <title>Cortical network reconfiguration aligns with shifts of basal ganglia and cerebellar influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammalian functional architecture flexibly adapts, transitioning from integration where information is distributed across the cortex, to segregation where information is focal in densely connected communities of brain regions. This flexibility in cortical brain networks is hypothesized to be driven by control signals originating from subcortical pathways, with the basal ganglia shifting the cortex towards integrated processing states and the cerebellum towards segregated states. In a sample of healthy human participants (N=242), we used fMRI to measure temporal variation in global brain networks while participants performed two tasks with similar cognitive demands (Stroop and Multi-Source Inference Task (MSIT)). Using the modularity index, we determined cortical networks shifted from integration (low modularity) at rest to high modularity during easier i.e. congruent (segregation). Increased task difficulty (incongruent) resulted in lower modularity in comparison to the easier counterpart indicating more integration of the cortical network. Influence of basal ganglia and cerebellum was measured using eigenvector centrality. Results correlated with decreases and increases in cortical modularity respectively, with only the basal ganglia influence preceding cortical integration. Our results support the theory the basal ganglia shifts cortical networks to integrated states due to environmental demand. Cerebellar influence correlates with shifts to segregated cortical states, though may not play a causal role.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent VAE for Building Latent Factor from Visual Neural Activity with Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seeking high-quality neural latent representations to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimulation has attracted much interest. Currently, some deep latent variable models rely on behavioral information (e.g., movement direction and position) as an aid to build expressive embeddings while being restricted by fixed time scales. Visual neural activity from passive viewing lacks clearly correlated behavior or task information, and high-dimensional visual stimulation leads to intricate neural dynamics. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Dependent SwapVAE, following the approach of separating content and style spaces in Swap-VAE, on the basis of which we introduce state variables to construct conditional distributions with temporal dependence for the above two spaces. Our model progressively generates latent variables along neural activity sequences, and we apply self-supervised contrastive learning to shape its latent space. In this way, it can effectively analyze complex neural dynamics from sequences of arbitrary length, even without task or behavioral data as auxiliary inputs. We compare TiDe-SwapVAE with alternative models on synthetic data and neural data from mouse visual cortex. The results show that our model not only accurately decodes complex visual stimuli but also extracts explicit temporal neural dynamics, demonstrating that it builds latent representations more relevant to visual stimulation.</description>

      <title>Confidence-weighted integration of human and machine judgments for superior decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various domains. Recent studies have shown that LLMs can surpass humans in certain tasks, such as predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated in a neuroscience forecasting task that, even when humans were inferior to LLMs, their combination with one or more LLMs consistently improved team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.</description>
