      <title>Estimates of transport distance in the central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be $d$-dimensional independent random vectors bounded with probability one. For simplicity, we assume that they have zero mean values: \begin{equation} \mathbf{P}\{\|X_{j}\|\le\tau\}=1,\quad\mathbf{E}\,X_{j}=0,\quad j=1,\ldots, n.\nonumber \end{equation} We study the distribution behavior of the sum $S=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$ as a function of the bounding value $\tau$.
  From the non-uniform Bikelis estimate in the one-dimensional central limit theorem it follows that $$ W_1(F,\Phi_{\sigma})\le c\tau. $$ with an absolute constant $c$, where $W_1$ is the Kantorovich--Rubinstein--Wasserstein transport distance, $F$ is the distribution of the sum $S$, and $\Phi_{\sigma}$ is the corresponding normal distribution. The main result of the paper is significantly stronger and more precise. It is claimed that $$ \rho(F,\Phi_{\sigma}) =\inf\int\exp(|x-y|/c\tau)\,d\pi(x,y)\le c, $$ where the infimum is taken over all bivariate probability distributions $\pi$ with marginal distributions $F$ and $\Phi_{\sigma}$. The result has also been generalized to distributions with sufficiently slowly growing cumulants from the class $\mathcal{A}_{1}(\tau )$, introduced in the author's 1986 paper. The possibility of generalizing the result to the multivariate case is discussed.</description>

      <title>Non Asymptotic Mixing Time Analysis of Non-Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing mixing times of finite-state ergodic Markov chains that applies to both reversible and non-reversible dynamics. The central object in our analysis is the projected transition operator $PU_{\perp 1}$, where $P$ is the transition kernel and $U_{\perp 1}$ is orthogonal projection onto mean-zero subspace in $\ell^{2}(\pi)$, where $\pi$ is the stationary distribution. We show that explicitly computable matrix norms of $(PU_{\perp 1})^k$ gives non-asymptotic mixing times/distance to stationarity, and bound autocorrelations at lag $k$. We establish, for the first time, submultiplicativity of pointwise chi-squared divergence in the general non-reversible case. We provide for all times $\chi^{2}(k)$ bounds based on the spectrum of $PU_{\perp 1}$, i.e., magnitude of its distinct non-zero eigenvalues, discrepancy between their algebraic and geometric multiplicities, condition number of a similarity transform, and constant coming from smallest atom of stationary distribution(all scientifically computable). Furthermore, for diagonalizable $PU_{\perp 1}$, we provide explict constants satisfying hypocoercivity phenomenon for discrete time Markov Chains. Our framework enables direct computation of convergence bounds for challenging non-reversible chains, including momentum-based samplers for V-shaped distributions. We provide the sharpest known bounds for non-reversible walk on triangle. Our results combined with simple regression reveals a fundamental insight into momentum samplers: although for uniform distributions, $n\log{n}$ iterations suffice for $\chi^{2}$ mixing, for V-shaped distributions they remain diffusive as $n^{1.969}\log{n^{1.956}}$ iterations are sufficient. The framework shows that for ergodic chains relaxation times $\tau_{rel}=\|\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}P^{k}U_{\perp 1}\|_{\ell^{2}(\pi)}$.</description>

      <title>Mixing of general biased adjacent transposition chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the general biased adjacent transposition shuffle process, which is a well-studied Markov chain on the symmetric group $S_n$. In each step, an adjacent pair of elements $i$ and $j$ are chosen, and then $i$ is placed ahead of $j$ with probability $p_{ij}$. This Markov chain arises in the study of self-organizing lists in theoretical computer science, and has close connections to exclusion processes from statistical physics and probability theory. Fill (2003) conjectured that for general $p_{ij}$ satisfying $p_{ij} \ge 1/2$ for all $i&lt;j$ and a simple monotonicity condition, the mixing time is polynomial. We prove that for any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, as long as $p_{ij} &gt;1/2+\varepsilon$ for all $i&lt;j$, the mixing time is $\Theta(n^2)$ and exhibits pre-cutoff. Our key technical result is a form of spatial mixing for the general biased transposition chain after a suitable burn-in period. In order to use this for a mixing time bound, we adapt multiscale arguments for mixing times from the setting of spin systems to the symmetric group.</description>

      <title>Finite free probability and $S$ transforms of Jacobi processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $S$ transforms of Jacobi processes in the frameworks of free and finite free probability theories. We begin by deriving a partial differential equation satisfied by the free $S$ transform of the free Jacobi process, and we provide a detailed analysis of its characteristic curves. We turn next our attention to the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian Jacobi process and to the dynamic of its roots, referred to as the frozen Jacobi process. In particular, we prove, for a specific set of parameters, that the former aligns up to a Szeg\"o variable transformation with the Hermite unitary polynomial. We also provide an expansion of the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian process in the basis of Jacobi polynomials. Finally, we establish the convergence of the frozen Jacobi process to the free Jacobi process in high dimensions by using the finite free S transform. In doing so, we prove a general result, interesting in its own, on the convergence of the finite differences of the finite free $S$ transform.</description>

      <title>The Cayley-Moser problem with Poissonian arrival of offers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a version of the classical Cayley-Moser optimal stopping problem, in which a seller must sell an asset by a given deadline, with the offers, which are independent random variables with a known distribution, arriving at random times, as a Poisson process. This continuous-time formulation of the problem is much more analytically tractable than the analogous discrete-time problem which is usually considered, leading to a simple differential equation that can be explicitly solved to find the optimal policy. We study the performance of this optimal policy, and obtain explicit expressions for the distribution of the realized sale price, as well as for the distribution of the stopping time. The general results are used to explore characteristics of the optimal policy and of the resulting bidding process, and are illustrated by application to several specific instances of the offer distribution.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Risk Sensitive Control of Diffusions under a General Structural Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infinite-horizon average (ergodic) risk sensitive control problem for diffusion processes under a general structural hypothesis: there is a partition of state space into two subsets, where the controlled diffusion process satisfies a Foster-Lyapunov type drift condition in one subset, under any stationary Markov control, while the near-monotonicity condition is satisfied with the running cost function being inf-compact in its complement. Under these conditions, we completely characterize the optimal stationary Markov controls. To prove this, we consider an inf-compact perturbation to the running cost over the entire space such that the resulting ergodic risk sensitive control problem is well-defined and then use the corresponding existing results. The heart of the analysis lies in exploiting the variational formula of exponential functionals of Brownian motion and applying it to the objective exponential cost function of the controlled diffusion. This representation facilitates us to view the risk sensitive cost for any stationary Markov control as the optimal value of a control problem of an extended diffusion involving a new auxiliary control where the optimal criterion is to maximize the associated long-run average cost criterion that is a difference of the original running cost and an extra term that is quadratic in the auxiliary control. The main difficulty in using this approach lies in the fact that tightness of mean empirical measures of the extended diffusion is not a priori implied by the analogous tightness property of the original diffusion. We overcome this by establishing a priori estimates for the extended diffusion associated with the nearly optimal auxiliary controls.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models and Estimation of Undetected Infections in the Transmission of Zika Virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zika fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease with potential severe neurological complications and birth defects, remains a significant public health concern. The epidemiological models often oversimplify the dynamics of Zika transmission by assuming immediate detection of all infected cases. This study provides an enhanced SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model to incorporate partial information by distinguishing between detected and undetected Zika infections (also known as "dark figures"). By distinguishing the compartments, the model captures the complexities of disease spread by accounting for uncertainties about transmission and the number of undetected infections. This model implements the Kalman filter technique to estimate the hidden states from the observed states. Numerical simulations were performed to understand the dynamics of Zika transmission and real-world data was utilized for parameterization and validation of the model. The study aims to provide information on the impact of undetected Zika infections on disease spread within the population, which will contribute to evidence-based decision making in public health policy and practice.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent in High-Dimensional Single-Layer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the high-dimensional scaling limits of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for single-layer networks. Building on the seminal work of Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits of SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on the critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain conditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls sample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling limit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlations and limit theorems for random intermittent maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of polynomial memory loss and the central limit theorem for time-dependent LSV maps. More precisely, we show that for random LSV maps corresponding to a random parameter beta() we obtain quenched memory loss, decay of correlations, central limit theorems with rates, moment bounds and almost sure invariance principles (ASIP) when the essential infimum of beta() is less than 1/5 and the driving process (i.e. random environment) is mixing sufficiently fast. In [59, Corollary 3.8] the ASIP was obtained for ergodic driving systems when the essential supremum of \b{eta} is less than 1/2. As will be elaborated in Section 1, restrictions on the essential infimum are more natural in our context. Our results have an abstract form which we believe could be useful in other circumstances, as will be elaborated in a future work</description>

      <title>Average Precision at Cutoff k under Random Rankings: Expectation and Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems and information retrieval platforms rely on ranking algorithms to present the most relevant items to users, thereby improving engagement and satisfaction. Assessing the quality of these rankings requires reliable evaluation metrics. Among them, Mean Average Precision at cutoff k (MAP@k) is widely used, as it accounts for both the relevance of items and their positions in the list.
  In this paper, the expectation and variance of Average Precision at k (AP@k) are derived since they can be used as biselines for MAP@k. Here, we covered two widely used evaluation models: offline and online. The expectation establishes the baseline, indicating the level of MAP@k that can be achieved by pure chance. The variance complements this baseline by quantifying the extent of random fluctuations, enabling a more reliable interpretation of observed scores.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Blockchain Architecture Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging applications of blockchains, such as grocery supply chains, require frequent updates to the data structure. This is in contrast with typical analyses of the Bitcoin blockchain, in which updates occur infrequently. With more frequent updates, the spread of blocks among participants in the blockchain protocol becomes complicated; thus, the structure of the blockchain data structure itself can differ significantly from the structure without the presence of network delays. In addition, emerging blockchain applications such as internet-of-things or supply chain warrant different architectures of the blockchain data structure, and so one needs a general understanding of how the data structure works rather than focusing on the specific architecture of Bitcoin. In this paper, we develop a new model to study the dynamics of the blockchain data structure in the presence of i.i.d.~network delays. Specifically, we consider an asymptotic design criterion called one-endedness, which should be satisfied by all blockchain architectures. We develop techniques to show that the one-endedness property holds for some of the leading blockchain architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove optimal convergence results of a stochastic particle method for computing the classical solution of a multivariate McKean-Vlasov equation, when the measure variable is in the drift, following the classical approach of [BT97, AKH02]. Our method builds upon adaptive nonparametric results in statistics that enable us to obtain a data-driven selection of the smoothing parameter in a kernel type estimator. In particular, we generalise the Bernstein inequality of [DMH21] for mean-field McKean-Vlasov models to interacting particles Euler schemes and obtain sharp deviation inequalities for the estimated classical solution. We complete our theoretical results with a systematic numerical study, and gather empirical evidence of the benefit of using high-order kernels and data-driven smoothing parameters.</description>

      <title>Monotone duality of interacting particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duality theory for monotone interacting particle systems was initiated by Gray (1986) and further developed by Sturm and Swart (2018). It contains the better known additive duality as a special case but differs in the sense that the dual process contains not only single particles but also pairs, triples, and general $n$-tuples of particles, which correspond to the fact that in the forward process sometimes several particles are needed to create one particle at a later time. In earlier work, the dual process was constructed for finite initial states only, but, assuming that the empty state is a trap for the forward process, we show that the dual process can be started in infinite initial states and has an upper invariant law. It can therefore be viewed as some sort of interacting particle system in its own right. For the monotone dual of a cooperative contact process, we show that the upper invariant law is the long-time limit started from any nontrivial homogeneous invariant law. We use this to prove continuity of the survival probability of the forward process as a function of its parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a method to exactly sample the trajectories of inverse subordinators (in the sense of the finite-dimensional distributions), jointly with the undershooting or overshooting process, is provided. The method applies to general strictly increasing subordinators. The (random) running times of these algorithms have finite moments and explicit bounds for the expectations are provided. Additionally, the Monte Carlo approximation of functionals of subdiffusive processes (in the form of time-changed Feller processes) is considered where a central limit theorem and the Berry-Esseen bounds are proved. The approximation of time-changed It\^o diffusions is also studied. The strong error, as a function of the time step, is explicitly evaluated demonstrating the strong convergence, and the algorithm's complexity is provided. The Monte Carlo approximation of functionals and its properties for the approximate method is studied as well. An application of our algorithms in the context of weak ergodicity breaking of subdiffusion is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Convex order and increasing convex order for McKean-Vlasov processes with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish results on the conditional and standard convex order, as well as the increasing convex order, for two processes $ X = (X_t)_{t \in [0, T]} $ and $ Y = (Y_t)_{t \in [0, T]} $, defined by the following McKean-Vlasov equations with common Brownian noise $ B^0 = (B_t^0)_{t \in [0, T]} $: $$ dX_t=b(t, X_t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))d t+\sigma(t, X_t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))d B_t+\sigma^0 (t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))d B^0_t$$ $$dY_t=\,\beta(t, Y_t, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t\,))d t+\,\theta(t, Y_t\,, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t\,))d B_t\,+\,\theta^0 (t, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t\,))d B^0_t,$$ where $ \mathcal{L}^1(X_t) $ (respectively $ \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t) $) denotes a version of the conditional distribution of $ X_t $ (resp. $ Y_t $) given $ B^0 $. These results extend those established for standard McKean-Vlasov equations in [Liu-Pag\`es, 2023] and [Liu-Pag\`es, 2021]. Under suitable conditions, for a (non-decreasing) convex functional $F$ on the path space with polynomial growth, we show $ \mathbb{E}[F(X) | B^0] \leq \mathbb{E}[F(Y) | B^0] $ almost surely. Moreover, for a (non-decreasing) convex functional $G$ defined on the product space of paths and their marginal distributions, we establish $$ \mathbb{E} \Big[\,G\big(X, (\mathcal{L}^1(X_t))_{t\in[0, T]}\big)\,\Big| \, B^0\,\Big]\leq \mathbb{E} \Big[\,G\big(Y, (\mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))_{t\in[0, T]}\big)\,\Big| \, B^0\,\Big] \quad \text{almost surely}. $$ Similar convex order results are also established for the corresponding particle system. Finally, we explore applications of these results to stochastic control problems and to the interbank systemic risk model introduced in [Carmona-Fouque-Sun, 2015].</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition IV: Toward Ballistic Acceleration for Log-Concave Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acceleration is a celebrated cornerstone of convex optimization, enabling gradient-based algorithms to converge sublinearly in the condition number. A major open question is whether an analogous acceleration phenomenon is possible for log-concave sampling. Underdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) has long been conjectured to be the natural candidate for acceleration, but a central challenge is that its degeneracy necessitates the development of new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. Although recent breakthroughs established ballistic acceleration for the (continuous-time) ULD diffusion via space-time Poincare inequalities, (discrete-time) algorithmic results remain entirely open: the discretization error of existing analysis techniques dominates any continuous-time acceleration.
  In this paper, we give a new coupling-based local error framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical discretizations in KL divergence. This extends the framework in Shifted Composition III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate diffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to sophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity. Applying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD establishes the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave sampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number). Along the way, we also obtain the first $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total variation error in dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for functionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained to the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal law. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartlsensitivityadapted} by introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with respect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit characterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging strategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Error bounds in a smooth metric for Brownian approximation of dynamical systems via Stein's method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method of diffusion approximations, developed by Barbour, to the study of chaotic dynamical systems. We establish an error bound in the functional central limit theorem with respect to an integral probability metric of smooth test functions under a functional correlation decay bound. For systems with a sufficiently fast polynomial rate of correlation decay, the error bound is of order $O(N^{-1/2})$, under an additional condition on the linear growth of variance. Applications include a family of interval maps with neutral fixed points and unbounded derivatives, and two-dimensional dispersing Sinai billiards.</description>

      <title>Random time-shift approximation enables hierarchical Bayesian inference of mechanistic within-host viral dynamics models on large datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus' biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method for this class of models by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the sensitivity properties of backward stochastic differential equations and reflected backward stochastic differential equations, which naturally arise in the context of optimal control and optimal stopping problems. Motivated by issues of sensitivity analysis in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) control and optimal stopping problems, we establish explicit formulas for the corresponding sensitivities under drift reference measure uncertainty. Our work is closely related to \citeauthor{bartl2023sensitivity} \cite{bartl2023sensitivity}. In contrast to the existing literature, our analysis is carried out within a general non-Markovian framework.</description>
