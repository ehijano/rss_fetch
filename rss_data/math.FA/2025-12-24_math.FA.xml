      <title>Titchmarsh theorems for H\"older-Lipschitz functions on fundamental domains of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with applications to boundedness of Fourier multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Titchmarsh theorems to the Fourier transform of two types of H\"older-Lipschitz functions - additive and multiplicative - defined on fundamental domains of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our approach is based on generalizations of Duren's lemma, which we first illustrate in the classical Euclidean setting. As an application of the second Titchmarsh theorem, we obtain boundedness results for Fourier multipliers between H\"older-Lipschitz spaces, from which we deduce Lipschitz-Sobolev regularity for Bessel potential operators on fundamental domains of lattices in the additive case. These results provide a natural generalization of classical one-dimensional theorems on the real line and on the torus to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Homological framework of noncommutative complex analytic geometry and functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we propose topological homology framework of noncommutative complex analytic geometries of Fr\'echet algebras, and investigate the related functional calculus and spectral mapping properties. It turns out that an ideal analytic geometry of a Fr\'echet algebra A can be described in terms of a \v{C}ech category over A. The functional calculus problem within a particular \v{C}ech A-category, and a left Fr\'echet A-module X is solved in term of the homological spectrum of X with respect to that category. As an application, we use the formal q-geometry of a contractive operator q-plane, and solve the related noncommutative holomorphic functional calculus problem. The related spectrum is reduced to Putinar spectrum of a Fr\'echet q-module. In the case of a Banach q-module we come up with the closure of its Taylor spectrum.</description>

      <title>Maximal functions, conjugations and multipliers between Toeplitz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toeplitz kernels can be defined by Riemann-Hilbert problems, by maximal functions, or by multipliers acting on model spaces. In this paper we study those different characterisations and their relations, highlighting, on the one hand, the crucial role played by symbol factorisation in obtaining multipliers from a model space onto a Toeplitz kernel, in particular isometric multipliers, and, on the other hand, a deep connection of maximal functions with a naturally defined conjugation on the Toeplitz kernel.</description>

      <title>Polynomial numerical index with respect to a norm-one polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the polynomial numerical index of a pair of Banach spaces with respect to a norm-one polynomial. This index generalizes the concept of polynomial numerical index defined by Y. S. Choi et al. in 2006 and extends to polynomials the notion of numerical index with respect to an operator, introduced by M. A. Ardalani in 2014. We investigate several properties of this index and present examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the set of points where the blow-up, in the sense of Preiss, of a signed Radon measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is unique and its invariant subspace has dimension $k$ is $k$-rectifiable. As simple applications, we obtain a rectifiability criterion for signed Radon measures and the extension of a result, due to Mattila, on measures having unique blow-up almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>On Radial Distribution and Quasi-exact Solvability of Brioschi-Halphen Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brioschi-Halphen equation (BHE) is a second order complex differential equation obtained by a two step transformation of the Lam\'e equation. The Lam\'e equation is an equation in Astronomical physics used in the study of motion of planetary bodies. In this seminar, the radial part of the BHE for sufficiently large $r$ and the argument limit $2\pi$ is obtained. The asymptotic radial wave function associated with BHE is obtained in terms of canonical polynomials $\mathscr{P}_{n+1},$ and spherical function in $L^{2}(G,{\rm d}\mu), G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ using point canonical transformation and distributional solution in $\mathscr{C}_{c}^{\infty}(\Omega)$ using Fourier transform method are obtained.</description>

      <title>Stability of mathematical quasicrystals under statistical convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that if a uniformly separated sequence in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is uniformly quasicrystalline and converges rapidly enough to a discrete set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having the same separation radius as the sequence, then $X$ is also a quasicrystal. The convergence is addressed for a distance that quantifies the statistical closeness between two uniformly discrete point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, motivated by the robustness of quasicrystals under random perturbations, we establish the continuity, for this distance, of the Fourier Transform of quasicrystals. This continuity result, in turn, allows us to rigorously demonstrate that established robustness properties of quasicrystals against random errors remain stable under the statistical convergence considered.</description>

Abstract: We show that on a standard non-atomic probability space the set of all invertible measure-preserving transformations is residual in the set of all measure-preserving transformations with respect to the strong (=weak) operator topology. This implies that all properties which are generic for invertible transformations are also generic for general ones.</description>

      <title>Macroscopically distinguishable superposition in infinitely many degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of macroscopically distinguishable superpositions within an infinite array of boson sites. Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in new index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>A note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first give a note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. It is already known that if a tuple of bilateral weighted shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, is disjoint hypercyclic, then non of the weighted shifts is invertible. We show that as for pseudo-shifts which is a generalization of weighted shifts, this fact is not true. We give an example of invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, which are disjoint hypercyclic and whose inverses are also disjoint hypercyclic. Next we partially answer to the open problem posed by Martin, Menet and Puig (2022)\cite{MMP22} concerned with disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, that is, we show that as for the operators on a reflexive Banach space, reiteratively hypercyclic ones are disjoint hypercyclic if and only if they are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak sharp bounds for Neural Network Operators in Sobolev-Orlicz spaces and their quantitative extensions to Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish sharp bounds for a family of Kantorovich-type neural network operators within the general frameworks of Sobolev-Orlicz and Orlicz spaces. We establish both strong (in terms of the Luxemburg norm) and weak (in terms of the modular functional) estimates, using different approaches. The strong estimates are derived for spaces generated by $\varphi$-functions that are $N$-functions or satisfy the $\Delta^\prime$-condition. Such estimates also lead to convergence results with respect to the Luxemburg norm in several instances of Orlicz spaces, including the exponential case. Meanwhile, the weak estimates are achieved under less restrictive assumptions on the involved $\varphi$-function. To obtain these results, we introduce some new tools and techniques in Orlicz spaces. Central to our approach is the Orlicz Minkowski inequality, which allows us to obtain unified strong estimates for the operators. We also present a weak (modular) version of this inequality holding under weaker conditions. Additionally, we introduce a novel notion of discrete absolute $\varphi$-moments of the hybrid type, and we employ the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator within Orlicz spaces for the asymptotic analysis. Furthermore, we introduce the new space $\mathcal{W}^{1,\varphi}(I)$, which is embedded in the Sobolev-Orlicz space $W^{1,\varphi}(I)$ and modularly dense in $L^\varphi(I)$. This allows to achieve asymptotic estimates for a wider class of $\varphi$-functions, including those that do not meet the $\Delta_2$-condition. For the extension to the whole Orlicz-setting, we generalize a Sobolev-Orlicz density result given by H. Musielak using Steklov functions, providing a modular counterpart.</description>

      <title>Non-strict singularity of optimal Sobolev embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the operator-theoretic property of strict singularity for optimal Sobolev embeddings within the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces (r.i. spaces).
  More specifically, we focus on studying the ``quality'' of non-compactness for optimal Sobolev embeddings $V^m_0X(\Omega)\to Y_X(\Omega)$, where $X$ is a given r.i. space and $Y_X$ is the corresponding optimal target r.i. space (i.e., the smallest among all r.i. spaces).
  For the class of sub-limiting norms (i.e., the norms whose fundamental function satisfies $\varphi_{Y_X}(t)\approx t^{-m/n}\varphi_X(t)$ as $t\to0^+$), we construct suitable spike-function sequences that establish a general framework for proving non-strict singularity of optimal (and thus non-compact) sublimiting Sobolev embeddings.
  As an application, we show that optimal sublimiting Sobolev embeddings are not strictly singular in a rather large subclass of r.i. spaces, namely weighted Lambda spaces $X=\Lambda^q_w$, $q\in[1, \infty)$. Except for the endpoint case $X=L^{n/m,1}$, our spike-function construction enables us to construct a subspace of $V^m_0X$ that is isomorphic to $\ell_q$, which we then leverage to prove the non-strict singularity of the corresponding optimal Sobolev embedding.</description>

Abstract: Consider the following approximation problem of a continuous function of three variables by the sum of three continuous functions of one variable:
  \[ E(f,\Omega)=\inf||f(x,y,z)-\phi(x)-\psi(y)-\omega(z)||_{\infty}=? \]
  where $f(x,y,z)$ is a given continuous function defined on $\Omega=[0,1]^3$ and the infimum runs over all triplets of continuous functions $\phi(x),\psi(y),\omega(z)$ defined on the unit interval $[0,1]$. In this paper, we will prove a formula to calculate the error $E(f,\Omega)$ under certain conditions.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we investigate the localizations in the sense of J. L. Taylor of the Arens-Michael-Fr\'echet algebras associated with noncommutative analytic spaces of a contractive q-plane representing its formal geometry. It turns out that all noncommutative Fr\'echet algebras obtained by the Fr\'echet algebra structure sheaves over open subsets from the topology bases are indeed localizations. That topological homology property of the structure sheaves results in the key properties of Taylor and Putinar spectra of the left Banach q-modules over the algebras of global sections.</description>

Abstract: Given $N$ geodesic caps on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and whose total normalized surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? In this work, we provide an asymptotically sharp upper bound for an antipodal partial covering of the sphere by $N \in (\omega(1),e^{o(\sqrt{d})})$ congruent caps, showing that the maximum proportion covered approaches $1 - e^{-1}$ as $d\to\infty$. We discuss the relation of this result to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions, the limitations of our technique via the Gaussian surface area bounds of K. Ball and F. Nazarov, and its applications in computer science theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure, which generalizes hyperbolicity to nonlinear dynamics in Banach spaces. The main novelties are that we allow the hyperbolic splitting to be discontinuous, and that in the invariance condition we assume only inclusions rather than equalities for both the stable and unstable subspaces. This allows us to cover Morse-Smale systems and generalized hyperbolicity. We suggest that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure for infinite-dimensional dynamics plays a role analogous to that of ``Axiom A and the strong transversality condition'' for dynamics on compact manifolds. For diffeomorphisms of a reflexive Banach space, we show that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure implies Lipschitz (periodic) shadowing and is robust under $C^1$-small perturbations. Assuming that generalized $(C, \lambda)$-structure is continuous for diffeomorphisms on an arbitrary Banach space we obtain a weak form of structural stability: the diffeomorphism is semi-conjugate in both directions with any of its $C^1$-small perturbation.</description>

      <title>The Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality for asymptotically flat, axisymmetric initial data satisfying the dominant energy condition with vacuum in the exterior region. This inequality establishes a lower bound for the total mass (ADM mass) in terms of the area and angular momentum of an outermost strictly stable marginally outer trapped surface. Equality holds if and only if the data arises from a slice of the Kerr spacetime.
  The proof introduces a four-stage method combining the Jang equation, conformal deformations, and Inverse Mean Curvature Flow techniques. The key innovation is the introduction of an angular-momentum-modified Hawking mass, which is shown to be monotonically non-decreasing along the flow and converges to the ADM mass at infinity.
  As a methodological application, we also outline a new proof strategy for the Charged Penrose Inequality for non-rotating Einstein-Maxwell data, demonstrating the versatility of this framework.</description>
