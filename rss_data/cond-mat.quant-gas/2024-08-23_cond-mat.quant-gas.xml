      <title>General hydrodynamic approach for a cold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive the hydrodynamics for a cold Bose gas from the microscopic platform based on the many-body Schrodinger equation and general assumptions of the hydrodynamic approach (HA) applicable to any dimension. We develop a general HA for a cold spatially inhomogeneous Bose gas assuming two different temporal and spatial scales and obtain the energy as a functional of both fast inner quantum mode and slow macroscopic mode. The equations governing the fast and slow modes are obtained from this functional by their independent variations. The fast mode is the wave function in the stationary state at local density which can be ground, excited with a nonzero atom momenta, or a superposition of more than one states. The energy eigenvalue (or expectation value) of this local wave function universally enters the hydrodynamic equation for the slow mode in the form of the local chemical potential which incorporates the inner local momentum. For zero inner momenta and particular choices of this eigenvalue as a function of gas density, this equation reduces to the known equations based on the local density approximation. If however the inner momenta are nonzero, the equation includes the interaction between these momenta and the slow mode velocity. Relation between this general HA and the standard local density approximation is elaborated. Two effects of the local momenta and their density dependence on the soliton solutions are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons induced by the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs with the combination of the magnetic flux, staggered single-particle loss, and strong two-particle loss. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization and reversal features of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Third-Quantized Master Equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process and its Entropy Production Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which facilitates a clear definition of the entropy production and heat dissipation rate in quantum systems. As an example, we investigate the entropy production rate of a harmonic oscillator in a squeezed thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Seeding decay of the false vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of false vacuum decay induced by spherical seeds. The type of seed considered has a boundary characterised by surface energy terms. The theory applies to false vacuum decay at zero and finite temperatures. Seeded nucleation may be important for enabling future false vacuum decay experiments on analogue systems using Bose Einstein Condensates (BEC). We show that our theory of seeded nucleation at finite temperature applied to a potassium BEC in two spatial dimensions agrees with numerical, real-time, simulations.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and dynamical transition in multimode Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spread complexity in two-mode Bose-Einstein condensations and unveil that the long-time average of the spread complexity $\overline{C}_{K}$ can probe the dynamical transition from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. When the parameter $\omega$ increases over a critical value $\omega_{c}$, we reveal that the spread complexity exhibits a sharp transition from lower to higher value, with the corresponding phase space trajectory changing from self-trapping to Josephson oscillation. Moreover, we scrutinize the eigen-spectrum and uncover the relation between the dynamical transition and the excited state quantum phase transition, which is characterized by the emergence of singularity in the density of states at critical energy $E_{c}$. In the thermodynamical limit, the cross point of $E_{c}(\omega)$ and the initial energy $E_{0}(\omega)$ determines the dynamical transition point $\omega_{c}$. Furthermore, we show that the different dynamical behavior for the initial state at a fixed point can be distinguished by the long-time average of the spread complexity, when the fixed point changes from unstable to stable. Finally, we also examine the sensitivity of $\overline{C}_{K}$ for the triple-well bosonic model which exibits the transition from chaotic dynamics to regular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing Using Bose-Einstein Condensate with Damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a type of machine learning in which the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems contributes to performance. In this study, we employ the Bose-Einstein condensate of dilute atomic gas as a reservoir to examine the effect of reduction in the number of condensed particles, damping, and the nonlinearity of the dynamics. It is observed that for the condensate to function as a reservoir, the physical system requires damping. The nonlinearity of the dynamics improves the performance of the reservoir, while the reduction in the number of condensed particles degrades the performance.</description>

      <title>Mean-chiral displacement in coherently driven photonic lattices and its application to synthetic frequency dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing topologically nontrivial photonic lattices by measuring their topological invariants is crucial in topological photonics. In conservative one-dimensional systems, a widely used observable to extract the winding number is the mean-chiral displacement. In many realistic photonic systems, however, losses can hardly be avoided, and little is known on how one can extend the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context. Here we theoretically propose an experimentally viable method to directly detect the topological winding number of one-dimensional chiral photonic lattices. The method we propose is a generalization of the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context with coherent illumination. By integrating the mean-chiral displacement of the steady state over the pump light frequency, one can obtain the winding number with a correction of the order of the loss rate squared. We demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to lattices along synthetic frequency dimensions.</description>

      <title>System-environment entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical description to relate the universal term to the effective ground-state degeneracy known as the $g$ function in a boundary conformal field theory, and use the renormalization group method to determine its value. We show that the universal contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement. Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no postselections, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>
