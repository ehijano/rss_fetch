      <title>Exact Biclique Partition number of Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biclique partition number of a graph \(G\), denoted \( \operatorname{bp}(G)\), is the minimum number of biclique subgraphs that partition the edge set of \(G\). The Graham-Pollak theorem states that the complete graph on \( n \) vertices cannot be partitioned into fewer than \( n-1 \) bicliques. In this note, we show that for any split graph \( G \), the biclique partition number satisfies \( \operatorname{bp}(G) = \operatorname{mc}(G^c) - 1 \), where \( \operatorname{mc}(G^c) \) denotes the number of maximal cliques in the complement of \( G \). This extends the celebrated Graham-Pollak theorem to a broader class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Word-Representability of Split Graphs with Independent Set of Size 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pair of letters $x$ and $y$ are said to alternate in a word $w$ if, after removing all letters except for the copies of $x$ and $y$ from $w$, the resulting word is of the form $xyxy\ldots$ (of even or odd length) or $yxyx\ldots$ (of even or odd length). A graph $G = (V (G), E(G))$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V(G)$, such that any two distinct vertices $x, y \in V (G)$ are adjacent in $G$ (i.e., $xy \in E(G)$) if and only if the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. A split graph is a graph in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. Word-representability of split graphs has been studied in a series of papers [2, 5, 7, 9] in the literature. In this work, we give a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization of word-representable split graphs with an independent set of size 4, which is an open problem posed by Kitaev and Pyatkin in [9]</description>

      <title>H-Planarity and Parametric Extensions: when Modulators Act Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a series of graph decompositions based on the modulator/target scheme of modification problems that enable several algorithmic applications that parametrically extend the algorithmic potential of planarity. In the core of our approach is a polynomial time algorithm for computing planar H-modulators. Given a graph class H, a planar H-modulator of a graph G is a set X \subseteq V(G) such that the ``torso'' of X is planar and all connected components of G - X belong to H. Here, the torso of X is obtained from G[X] if, for every connected component of G-X, we form a clique out of its neighborhood on G[X]. We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G has a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable, and decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial time. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by defining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which generalize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the class H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various H-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By combining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we know that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar treewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring and polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings. Furthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes (EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.</description>

      <title>On the Constant-Factor Approximability of Minimum Cost Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimum cost constraint satisfaction problems (MinCostCSP) through the algebraic lens. We show that for any constraint language $\Gamma$ which has the dual discriminator operation as a polymorphism, there exists a $|D|$-approximation algorithm for MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ where $D$ is the domain. Complementing our algorithmic result, we show that any constraint language $\Gamma$ where MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ admits a constant-factor approximation must have a \emph{near-unanimity} (NU) polymorphism unless P = NP, extending a similar result by Dalmau et al. on MinCSPs. These results imply a dichotomy of constant-factor approximability for constraint languages that contain all permutation relations (a natural generalization for Boolean CSPs that allow variable negation): either MinCostCSP$(\Gamma)$ has an NU polymorphism and is $|D|$-approximable, or it does not have any NU polymorphism and is NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor. Finally, we present a constraint language which has a majority polymorphism, but is nonetheless NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, showing that the condition of having an NU polymorphism is in general not sufficient unless UGC fails.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bound for Multicolor Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following asymptotically tight lower bound for $k$-color discrepancy: For any $k \geq 2$, there exists a hypergraph with $n$ hyperedges such that its $k$-color discrepancy is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This improves on the previously known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n/\log k})$ due to Caragiannis et al. (arXiv:2502.10516). As an application, we show that our result implies improved lower bounds for group fair division.</description>

      <title>Reducing Sensor Requirements by Relaxing the Network Metric Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source localization in graphs involves identifying the origin of a phenomenon or event, such as an epidemic outbreak or a misinformation source, by leveraging structural graph properties. One key concept in this context is the metric dimension, which quantifies the minimum number of strategically placed sensors needed to uniquely identify all vertices based on their distances. While powerful, the traditional metric dimension imposes a stringent requirement that every vertex must be uniquely identified, often necessitating a large number of sensors. In this work, we relax the metric dimension and allow vertices at a graph distance less than k to share identical distance profiles relative to the sensors. This relaxation reduces the number of sensors needed while maintaining sufficient resolution for practical applications like source localization and network monitoring. We provide two main theoretical contributions: an analysis of the k-relaxed metric dimension in deterministic trees, revealing the interplay between structural properties and sensor placement, and an extension to random trees generated by branching processes, offering insights into stochastic settings. We also conduct numerical experiments across a variety of graph types, including random trees, random geometric graphs, and real-world networks. The results show that the relaxed metric dimension is significantly smaller than the traditional metric dimension. Furthermore, the number of vertices indistinguishable from any given target vertex always remains small. Finally, we propose and evaluate a two-step localization strategy that balances the trade-off between resolution and the number of sensors required. This strategy identifies an optimal relaxation level that minimizes the total number of sensors across both steps, providing a practical and efficient approach to source localization.</description>

      <title>Closure property of contraction-depth of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction$^*$-depth is a matroid depth parameter analogous to tree-depth of graphs. We establish the matroid analogue of the classical graph theory result asserting that the tree-depth of a graph $G$ is the minimum height of a rooted forest whose closure contains $G$ by proving the following for every matroid $M$ (except the trivial case when $M$ consists of loops and coloops only): the contraction$^*$-depth of $M$ plus one is equal to the minimum contraction-depth of a matroid containing $M$ as a restriction.</description>

      <title>Extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected graph, on four or more vertices, is matching covered (aka 1-extendable) if every edge is present in some perfect matching. An ear decomposition theorem exists for bipartite matching covered graphs due to Hetyei. From the results and proofs of Lov\'asz and Plummer, that rely on Hetyei's theorem, one may deduce that any minimal bipartite matching covered graph has at least $2(m-n+2)$ vertices of degree two (where minimal means that deleting any edge results in a graph that is not matching covered); such a graph is said to be extremal if it attains the stated lower bound.
  In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of the class of extremal minimal bipartite matching covered graphs. In particular, we prove that every such graph $G$ is obtained from two copies of a tree devoid of degree two vertices, say $T$ and $T'$, by adding edges -- each of which joins a leaf of $T$ with the corresponding leaf of $T'$.
  Apart from the aforementioned bound, there are four other bounds that appear in, or may be deduced from, the work of Lov\'asz and Plummer. Each of these bounds leads to a notion of extremality. In this paper, we obtain a complete characterization of all of these extremal classes and also establish relationships between them. Two of our characterizations are in the same spirit as the one stated above. For the remaining two extremal classes, we reduce each of them to one of the already characterized extremal classes using standard matching theoretic operations.
  A connected graph is k-extendable if it has a matching of cardinality $k$ and each such matching extends to a perfect matching. We also discuss bounds proved by Lou (1999) for minimal k-extendable bipartite graphs. We conjecture stronger bounds and provide evidence for our conjectures by constructing tight examples that are straightforward generalizations of the ones that appear in the 1-extendable case.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.
