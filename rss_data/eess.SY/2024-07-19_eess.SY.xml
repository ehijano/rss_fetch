      <title>Trajectory Planning Using Tire Thermodynamics for Automated Drifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicles need to estimate tire-road friction information, as it plays a key role in safe trajectory planning and vehicle dynamics control. Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</description>

      <title>Geometric Data Fusion for Collaborative Attitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the collaborative attitude estimation problem for a multi-agent system. The agents are equipped with sensors that provide directional measurements and relative attitude measurements. We present a bottom-up approach where each agent runs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) locally using directional measurements and augments this with relative attitude measurements provided by neighbouring agents. The covariance estimates of the relative attitude measurements are geometrically corrected to compensate for relative attitude between the agent that makes the measurement and the agent that uses the measurement before being fused with the local estimate using the convex combination ellipsoid (CCE) method to avoid data incest. Simulations are undertaken to numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solving the Model Unavailable MARE using Q-Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the discrete-time modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE) is solved when the system model is completely unavailable. To achieve this, firstly a brand new iterative method based on the standard discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE) and its input weighting matrix is proposed to solve the MARE. For the single-input case, the iteration can be initialized by an arbitrary positive input weighting if and only if the MARE has a stabilizing solution; nevertheless a pre-given input weighting matrix of a sufficiently large magnitude is used to perform the iteration for the multi-input case when the characteristic parameter belongs to a specified subset. Benefit from the developed specific iteration structure, the Q-learning (QL) algorithm can be employed to subtly solve the MARE where only the system input/output data is used thus the system model is not required. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results and the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Predictive control for nonlinear stochastic systems: Closed-loop guarantees with unbounded noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic predictive control framework for nonlinear systems subject to unbounded process noise with closed-loop guarantees. First, we first provide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general probabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide a tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state and a simple constraint tightening. Both formulations ensure recursive feasibility, satisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the resulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for probabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear systems using stochastic contraction metrics. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method through a simulation of a chain of mass-spring-dampers with nonlinear Coulomb friction. Overall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable stochastic predictive control approaches with closed-loop guaranteed for nonlinear systems with unbounded noise.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Data Availability on Machine Learning-augmented MPC for a Building Energy Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in the development of Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based energy management systems (EMSs) for buildings is the availability of an accurate model. One approach to address this is to augment an existing gray-box model with data-driven residual estimators. The efficacy of such estimators, and hence the performance of the EMS, relies on the availability of sufficient and suitable training data. In this work, we evaluate how different data availability scenarios affect estimator and controller performance. To do this, we perform software-in-the-loop (SiL) simulation with a physics-based digital twin using real measurement data. Simulation results show that acceptable estimation and control performance can already be achieved with limited available data, and we confirm that leveraging historical data for pretraining boosts efficacy.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Optimization: Enhancing Wind Turbine Energy Generation while Mitigating Noise Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a torque-pitch control framework using deep reinforcement learning for wind turbines to optimize the generation of wind turbine energy while minimizing operational noise. We employ a double deep Q-learning, coupled to a blade element momentum solver, to enable precise control over wind turbine parameters. In addition to the blade element momentum, we use the wind turbine acoustic model of Brooks Pope and Marcolini. Through training with simple winds, the agent learns optimal control policies that allow efficient control for complex turbulent winds. Our experiments demonstrate that the reinforcement learning is able to find optima at the Pareto front, when maximizing energy while minimizing noise. In addition, the adaptability of the reinforcement learning agent to changing turbulent wind conditions, underscores its efficacy for real-world applications. We validate the methodology using a SWT2.3-93 wind turbine with a rated power of 2.3 MW. We compare the reinforcement learning control to classic controls to show that they are comparable when not taking into account noise emissions. When including a maximum limit of 45 dB to the noise produced (100 meters downwind of the turbine), the extracted yearly energy decreases by 22%. The methodology is flexible and allows for easy tuning of the objectives and constraints through the reward definitions, resulting in a flexible multi-objective optimization framework for wind turbine control. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of RL-based control strategies to improve wind turbine efficiency while mitigating noise pollution, thus advancing sustainable energy generation technologies</description>

      <title>The Construction of a Soft Gripper Based on Magnetorheological Elastomer with Permanent Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, magnetorheological elastomers have become an interesting smart material with many new designs for robotics. A variety of applications have been built with magnetorheological elastomers, such as vibration absorbers, actuators, or grippers, showing that this material is promising for soft robotics. In this work, the novel concept of a gripper is proposed, exploring the features of a magnetorheological elastomer and permanent magnet. The gripper uses the energy of a permanent magnet to provide a self-closing gripping mechanism. The usage of flexible material enables one to hold delicate objects of various shapes. This paper presents the rolling effect of magnetorheological elastomer and permanent magnet, the design process, and the features of the soft gripper. The effectiveness of the soft gripper was validated in a series of experiments that involved lifting different objects.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Mapping with Adaptive High-Intensity Region Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research is motivated by a scenario where a group of UAVs is assigned to map an unknown scalar field, with the imperative of maintaining a safe distance from the sources of the field to evade detection or damage. The location of the sources is unknown a priori, so the UAVs rely on measurements of the field intensity to gauge safety. The UAVs estimate the unknown scalar field using Gaussian process (GP) regression and use the estimate to generate a map of high-intensity regions using Hough transform (HT), updated online based on the field measurements. A convergence analysis shows the boundedness of the error between the actual scalar field and the learned scalar field. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn scalar fields with multiple high-intensity regions while reducing the number of measurements taken inside the high-intensity regions.</description>

      <title>Managing Risk using Rolling Forecasts in Energy-Limited and Stochastic Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study risk-aware linear policy approximations for the optimal operation of an energy system with stochastic wind power, storage, and limited fuel. The resulting problem is a sequential decision-making problem with rolling forecasts. In addition to a risk-neutral objective, this paper formulates two risk-aware objectives that control the conditional value-at-risk of system cost and the buffered probability of exceeding a predefined threshold of unserved load. The resulting policy uses a parameter-modified cost function approximation that reduces the computational load compared to the direct inclusion of those risk measures in the problem objective. We demonstrate our method on a numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Tire Force Modeling for Automated Drifting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated drifting presents a challenge problem for vehicle control, requiring models and control algorithms that can precisely handle nonlinear, coupled tire forces at the friction limits. We present a neural network architecture for predicting front tire lateral force as a drop-in replacement for physics-based approaches. With a full-scale automated vehicle purpose-built for the drifting application, we deploy these models in a nonlinear model predictive controller tuned for tracking a reference drifting trajectory, for direct comparisons of model performance. The neural network tire model exhibits significantly improved path tracking performance over the brush tire model in cases where front-axle braking force is applied, suggesting the neural network's ability to express previously unmodeled, latent dynamics in the drifting condition.</description>

      <title>A Formal Analysis of Iterated TDD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we formally analyze the software methodology called (iterated) Test Driven Development (TDD). We formally define Specification, Software, Testing, Equivalence Partitions, Coupling, to argue about the nature of the software development in terms of TDD. We formalize Iterative TDD and find a context in which iterated TDD ``provably produce'' ``provably correct code'' from ``specifications'' while being stable in terms of iterated code churns. We demonstrate that outside this context iterated TDD will exhibit chaotic behavior, implying unpredictable messy amount of code churn. We argue that the research finding of ``ineffective'' iterated TDD found by earlier researches are due to missing this context, while the findings of ``effective'' iterated TDD is due to accidentally falling into the context or simply placebo.</description>

The paper gives a systematic overview of UATs starting from the preliminary results on function approximation, such as Taylor's theorem, Fourier's theorem, Weierstrass approximation theorem, Kolmogorov - Arnold representation theorem, etc. Theoretical and numerical aspects of UATs are covered from both arbitrary width and depth.</description>

      <title>A Master-Follower Teleoperation System for Robotic Catheterization: Design, Characterization, and Tracking Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Observer for Estimating Coupled Disturbances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision control for nonlinear systems is impeded by the low-fidelity dynamical model and external disturbance. Especially, the intricate coupling between internal uncertainty and external disturbance is usually difficult to be modeled explicitly. Here we show an effective and convergent algorithm enabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control and learning philosophies. Specifically, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures depending on system state and external disturbance respectively. A Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix by using historical time-series data. Finally, a higher-order disturbance observer (HODO) is developed to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations. We believe this work can offer a new option to merge learning schemes into the control framework for addressing existing intractable control problems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Robot Trajectory Planning -- A Comparative Analysis of Algorithms And Software Implementations in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory Planning is a crucial word in Modern &amp; Advanced Robotics. It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning. The paper primarily focuses on getting a better understanding of these unpredictable environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for operation and planning in energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. However, due to data collection costs and privacy concerns, such data is often unavailable or insufficient for downstream tasks. Data synthesis is a potential solution for this data scarcity. With the recent development of generative AI, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. Additionally, EnergyDiff consistently generates high-quality time series data across diverse energy domains, time resolutions, and at both customer and transformer levels with reduced computational need.</description>

      <title>Convergence result for the gradient-push algorithm and its application to boost up the Push-DIging algorithm</title>

Abstract: The gradient-push algorithm is a fundamental algorithm for the distributed optimization problem \begin{equation} \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n f_j (x), \end{equation} where each local cost $f_j$ is only known to agent $a_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and the agents are connected by a directed graph. In this paper, we obtain convergence results for the gradient-push algorithm with constant stepsize whose range is sharp in terms the order of the smoothness constant $L&gt;0$. Precisely, under the two settings: 1) Each local cost $f_i$ is strongly convex and $L$-smooth, 2) Each local cost $f_i$ is convex quadratic and $L$-smooth while the aggregate cost $f$ is strongly convex, we show that the gradient-push algorithm with stepsize $\alpha&gt;0$ converges to an $O(\alpha)$-neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$ for a range $\alpha \in (0, c/L]$ with a value $c&gt;0$ independent of $L&gt;0$. As a benefit of the result, we suggest a hybrid algorithm that performs the gradient-push algorithm with a relatively large stepsize $\alpha&gt;0$ for a number of iterations and then go over to perform the Push-DIGing algorithm. It is verified by a numerical test that the hybrid algorithm enhances the performance of the Push-DIGing algorithm significantly. The convergence results of the gradient-push algorithm are also supported by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Governance for Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the potential for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to be governed in a decentralised manner, whereby blockchain-based infrastructure facilitates the communication between digital and physical domains through self-governing and self-organising principles. Decentralised governance paradigms that integrate computation in physical domains (such as 'Decentralised Autonomous Organisations' (DAOs)) represent a novel approach to autono-mous governance and operations. These have been described as akin to cybernetic systems. Through the lens of a case study of an autonomous cabin called "no1s1" which demonstrates self-ownership via blockchain-based control and feedback loops, this research explores the potential for blockchain infrastructure to be utilised in the management of physical systems. By highlighting the considerations and challenges of decentralised governance in managing autonomous physical spaces, the study reveals that autonomy in the governance of autonomous CPS is not merely a technological feat but also involves a complex mesh of functional and social dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of developing continuous feedback loops and adaptive governance frameworks within decentralised CPS to address both expected and emergent challenges. This investigation contributes to the fields of infra-structure studies and Cyber-Physical Systems engineering. It also contributes to the discourse on decentralised governance and autonomous management of physical spaces by offering both practical insights and providing a framework for future research.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40{\deg} to 43{\deg} over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20{\deg}. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32{\deg} to 50{\deg} when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25{\deg}. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40{\deg} to 40{\deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{\deg} across the operational frequency range.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Path Integral Methods with Reach-Avoid Tasks and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of robotics necessitates robust tools for developing and testing safe control architectures in dynamic and uncertain environments. Ensuring safety and reliability in robotics, especially in safety-critical applications, is crucial, driving substantial industrial and academic efforts. In this context, we extend CBFkit, a Python/ROS2 toolbox, which now incorporates a planner using reach-avoid specifications as a cost function. This integration with the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controllers enables the toolbox to satisfy complex tasks while ensuring formal safety guarantees under various sources of uncertainty using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). CBFkit is optimized for speed using JAX for automatic differentiation and jaxopt for quadratic program solving. The toolbox supports various robotic applications, including autonomous navigation, human-robot interaction, and multi-robot coordination. The toolbox also offers a comprehensive library of planner, controller, sensor, and estimator implementations. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of CBFkit in different robotic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Application of Data-Driven Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicle Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of autonomous driving technology, there are increasing demands for vehicle control, and MPC has become a widely researched topic in both industry and academia. Existing MPC control methods based on vehicle kinematics or dynamics have challenges such as difficult modeling, numerous parameters, strong nonlinearity, and high computational cost. To address these issues, this paper adapts an existing Data-driven MPC control method and applies it to autonomous vehicle steering control. This method avoids the need for complex vehicle system modeling and achieves trajectory tracking with relatively low computational time and small errors. We validate the control effectiveness of the algorithm in specific scenario through CarSim-Simulink simulation and perform comparative analysis with PID and vehicle kinematics MPC, confirming the feasibility and superiority of it for vehicle steering control.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</description>
