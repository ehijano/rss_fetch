      <title>Design of DNA Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA strand displacement (SD) reactions are central to the operation of many synthetic nucleic acid systems, including molecular circuits, sensors, and machines. Over the years, a broad set of design frameworks has emerged to accommodate various functional goals, initial configurations, and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, key challenges persist, particularly in reliably predicting reaction kinetics. This review examines recent approaches to SD reaction design, with emphasis on the properties of single reactions, including kinetics, structural factors, and limitations in current modelling practices. We identify promising innovations while analysing the factors that continue to hinder predictive accuracy. We conclude by outlining future directions for achieving more robust and programmable behaviour in DNA-based systems.</description>

      <title>MODE: Learning compositional representations of complex systems with Mixtures Of Dynamical Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.</description>
