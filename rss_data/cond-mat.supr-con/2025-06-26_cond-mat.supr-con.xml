      <title>Pair density modulation from glide symmetry breaking and nematic superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair density modulation is a superconducting state, recently observed in exfoliated iron-based superconductor flakes, in which the superconducting gap oscillates strongly with the same periodicity as the underlying crystalline lattice. We propose a microscopic model that explains this modulation through a combination of glide-mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of nematic superconductivity. The first ingredient results in a sublattice texture on the Fermi surface, which is aligned with the anisotropic superconducting gap of the nematic $s_\pm+d$ state. This gives rise to distinctive gap maxima and minima located on the two inequivalent iron sublattices while still being a zero-momentum pairing state. We discuss how further investigation of such modulations can give insight into the nature of the superconducting pairing, such as the signs of the order parameters and visualization of a phase transition to a mixed two-component state using local probes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution of coupled self--consistency and linearised Usadel equations for the dirty finite--sized superconductor at critical temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we analytically investigate the linearised Usadel equation and the self--consistency equation, defining the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition of a finite--sized superconductor in the dirty limit. This is a system of coupled differential and integral equations for the anomalous Green function and the order parameter of the superconductor. The formal solution of the system is found for the general case of the linearised boundary conditions, reducing the solution to the solution of an eigenvalue problem. The latter defines the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition and the spatial distributions of the anomalous Green function and the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional transition metal selenides family M2Se: A platform for superconductivity, band topology, and charge density waves</title>

Abstract: MXenes and MBenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides and borides, have been extensively studied for their impressive properties. Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Ionic-bond-driven atom-bridged room-temperature Cooper pairing in cuprates and nickelates: a theoretical framework supported by 32 experimental evidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates and nickelates. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in oxides, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.</description>

      <title>Very strong coupling limit of Eliashberg-McMillan theory and the upper limit for superconducting transition temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. We discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants. Finally we also briefly discuss some pessimistic estimates for $T_c$ of metallic hydrogen obtained in ``jellium'' model.</description>

      <title>Buckyballs directly probe inter-valley coherence in moire heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire materials like twisted bilayer graphene have emerged as a rich playground of strongly correlated physics, where the effect of interactions can be drastically enhanced by tuning the non-interacting density of states via twist angle. A key feature of bilayer graphene at small twist angles is that the two valleys of graphene are effectively decoupled at the non-interacting level, leading to an emergent U(1) symmetry corresponding to the conservation of valley-charge. Theoretical studies invariably find that short-ranged interactions tend to break this symmetry, leading to inter-valley coherence (IVC). Here, I propose an experimental signature of IVC order by coupling with a closely related system where valley-mixing is guaranteed - the pentagonal disclinations of graphene. Such disclinations are naturally found in fullerenes. The tunneling current between twisted bilayer graphene and an appropriately oriented large buckyball has a sharp signature of the onset of IVC order. Successfully integrating these fullerenes in a scanning tunneling microscope would allow spatial resolution of the IVC order parameter on a sub-moire scale. Experimentally constraining the broken symmetries and order parameters in the multitude of emerging correlated insulators is a crucial first step to understanding the superconductivity that develops on doping these exotic `normal' states.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.Atiyah and R.Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</description>
