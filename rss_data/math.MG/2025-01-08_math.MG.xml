      <title>Two-point dilation-homogeneous metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of the paper is to give a full classification (up to isometry) of all metric spaces X with the following two properties: X contains a compact set with non-empty interior; and for any three distinct points a, b and c of X there exists a (bijective) dilation on X that fixes a and sends b to c. As a consequence, we obtain a new characterisation of the Euclidean spaces: these are (up to isometry) precisely all metric spaces that have the above two properties, and (in addition) contain three distinct points x, y, z that are metrically collinear (that is, for which d(x,z) = d(x,y)+d(y,z)).</description>

      <title>Spherical friezes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in spherical distance geometry aims to recover an $n$-tuple of points on a 2-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, viewed up to oriented isometry, from $O(n)$ input measurements. We solve this problem using algorithms that employ only the four arithmetic operations. Each algorithm recursively produces output data that we arrange into a new type of frieze pattern. These frieze patterns exhibit glide symmetry and a version of the Laurent phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, which were conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object that we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known exact solutions, with the numerical work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of inequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If $K$ is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of $K$, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

      <title>Dual metrics on the boundary of strictly polyhedral hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16971v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact oriented 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of surfaces of genii $&gt;1$ such that the interior of $M$ is hyperbolizable. We show that for each spherical cone-metric $d$ on $\partial M$ such that all cone-angles are greater than $2\pi$ and the lengths of all closed geodesics that are contractible in $M$ are greater than $2\pi$ there exists a unique strictly polyhedral hyperbolic metric on $M$ such that $d$ is the induced dual metric on $\partial M$.</description>

      <title>The Torus of Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the 2-torus $\mathbb T$, an abelian linear algebraic group, is a fine moduli space of labeled, oriented, possibly-degenerate inscribable similarity classes of triangles, where a triangle is {\it inscribable} if it can be inscribed in a circle. A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines a quotient stack $[\mathbb T/D_6]$, which is the stack of absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) possibly-degenerate inscribable classes. We show the main triangle types form distinguished algebraic substructures: subgroups, cosets, and elements of small order, and we apply the natural metric on $\mathbb T$ to compare them.</description>

Abstract: We call a norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ intuitive if for every points $p_1,\ldots,p_m$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, one of the geometric medians of the points over the norm is in their convex hull. We characterize all intuitive norms.</description>

      <title>Universal Differentiability Sets in Laakso Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists a family of mutually singular doubling measures on Laakso space with respect to which real-valued Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable. This implies that there exists a measure zero universal differentiability set in Laakso space. Additionally, we show that each of the measures constructed supports a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Critical level set percolation for the GFF in $d&gt;6$: comparison principles and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ has been the subject of much recent activity. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this article, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>
