      <title>IKFST: IOO and KOO Algorithms for Accelerated and Precise WFST-based End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition has become the dominant paradigm in both academia and industry. To enhance recognition performance, the Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) is widely adopted to integrate acoustic and language models through static graph composition, providing robust decoding and effective error correction. However, WFST decoding relies on a frame-by-frame autoregressive search over CTC posterior probabilities, which severely limits inference efficiency. Motivated by establishing a more principled compatibility between WFST decoding and CTC modeling, we systematically study the two fundamental components of CTC outputs, namely blank and non-blank frames, and identify a key insight: blank frames primarily encode positional information, while non-blank frames carry semantic content. Building on this observation, we introduce Keep-Only-One and Insert-Only-One, two decoding algorithms that explicitly exploit the structural roles of blank and non-blank frames to achieve significantly faster WFST-based inference without compromising recognition accuracy. Experiments on large-scale in-house, AISHELL-1, and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art recognition accuracy with substantially reduced decoding latency, enabling truly efficient and high-performance WFST decoding in modern speech recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Latent Flow Matching for Expressive Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)-based singing voice synthesis provides efficient inference and strong audio quality by learning a score-conditioned prior and a recording-conditioned posterior latent space. However, because synthesis relies on prior samples while training uses posterior latents inferred from real recordings, imperfect distribution matching can cause a prior-posterior mismatch that degrades fine-grained expressiveness such as vibrato and micro-prosody. We propose FM-Singer, which introduces conditional flow matching (CFM) in latent space to learn a continuous vector field transporting prior latents toward posterior latents along an optimal-transport-inspired path. At inference time, the learned latent flow refines a prior sample by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) before waveform generation, improving expressiveness while preserving the efficiency of parallel decoding. Experiments on Korean and Chinese singing datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, including lower mel-cepstral distortion and fundamental-frequency error and higher perceptual scores on the Korean dataset. Code, pretrained checkpoints, and audio demos are available at https://github.com/alsgur9368/FM-Singer</description>

      <title>Timed text extraction from Taiwanese Kua-\'a-h\`i TV series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taiwanese opera (Kua-\'a-h\`i), a major form of local theatrical tradition, underwent extensive television adaptation notably by pioneers like I\^unn L\=e-hua. These videos, while potentially valuable for in-depth studies of Taiwanese opera, often have low quality and require substantial manual effort during data preparation. To streamline this process, we developed an interactive system for real-time OCR correction and a two-step approach integrating OCR-driven segmentation with Speech and Music Activity Detection (SMAD) to efficiently identify vocal segments from archival episodes with high precision. The resulting dataset, consisting of vocal segments and corresponding lyrics, can potentially supports various MIR tasks such as lyrics identification and tune retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/z-huang/ocr-subtitle-editor .</description>

      <title>Investigating the Viability of Employing Multi-modal Large Language Models in the Context of Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong generalisation in detecting image and video deepfakes, their use for audio deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of MLLMs for audio deepfake detection. Combining audio inputs with a range of text prompts as queries to find out the viability of MLLMs to learn robust representations across modalities for audio deepfake detection. Therefore, we attempt to explore text-aware and context-rich, question-answer based prompts with binary decisions. We hypothesise that such a feature-guided reasoning will help in facilitating deeper multimodal understanding and enable robust feature learning for audio deepfake detection. We evaluate the performance of two MLLMs, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and SALMONN, in two evaluation modes: (a) zero-shot and (b) fine-tuned. Our experiments demonstrate that combining audio with a multi-prompt approach could be a viable way forward for audio deepfake detection. Our experiments show that the models perform poorly without task-specific training and struggle to generalise to out-of-domain data. However, they achieve good performance on in-domain data with minimal supervision, indicating promising potential for audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>MR-DAW: Towards Collaborative Digital Audio Workstations in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.</description>

      <title>A Language-Agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE Architecture for CTC-based Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR (mASR) models such as Whisper achieve strong performance but incur high computational and latency costs, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we propose a lightweight and language-agnostic multilingual ASR system based on a CTC architecture with domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a Language-agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE (HLoRA) framework integrated into an mHuBERT-CTC model, enabling end-to-end decoding via LID-posterior-driven LoRA routing. The hierarchical design consists of a multilingual shared LoRA for learning language-invariant acoustic representations and language-specific LoRA experts for modeling language-dependent characteristics. The proposed routing mechanism removes the need for prior language identity information or explicit language labels during inference, achieving true language-agnostic decoding. Experiments on MSR-86K and the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge datasets demonstrate that HLoRA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art two-stage inference methods using only single-pass decoding, significantly improving decoding efficiency for low-resource mASR applications.</description>
