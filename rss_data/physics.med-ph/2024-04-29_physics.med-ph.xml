      <title>Volumic deformation of human cornea under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cornea, as the outer element of the human eye, plays a pivotal role in vision. Any defects in its shape can result in visual impairments. Mechanical defect manifest as shape defects, as the cornea is under to pressure. Our study presents the first comprehensive observation of human corneal deformation throughout its entire thickness during an inflation test, through Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Horizontal deformation reveals depth-dependent heterogeneity, suggesting that the cornea's posterior part is softer than the anterior part. Vertical deformation was observed at levels significantly higher than expected and exhibited depth-dependent heterogeneity, delineating three distinct regions. The central region of the cornea initially experienced rapid swelling, possibly due to osmotic effects, followed by increasing compressions as pressure rose. Conversely, the anterior and posterior regions showed no sign of swelling, and a difference in the compressive response, possibly due to difference in stiffness. Our study shows the complexity of human corneal mechanics, highlighting strong anisotropy and depth-dependent behavior, and implicating osmotic and poroelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Deep Evidential Learning for Dose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel application of an uncertainty-quantification framework called Deep Evidential Learning in the domain of radiotherapy dose prediction. Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity, compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Rotary Excitation of non-sinusoidal pulsed magnetic fields: Towards non-invasive direct detection of cardiac conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: In the recent past, spin-locking MRI experiments were successfully applied for the direct detection of sinusoidal magnetic field oscillations in the sub-nT range. In the present study, this detection approach was extended to non-sinusoidal pulsed magnetic fields based on the Rotary Excitation (REX) mechanism. Methods: The new detection concept was examined by means of Bloch simulations, evaluating the interaction effect of spin-locked magnetization and low-frequency pulsed magnetic fields. The REX detection approach was validated under controlled conditions in phantom experiments at 3T. Gaussian and Sinc-shaped stimuli were investigated. In addition, the detection of artificial fields resembling a cardiac QRS complex, which is the most prominent peak visible on a Magnetocardiogram, was tested. Results: Bloch simulations demonstrated that the REX method has a high sensitivity to pulsed fields in the resonance case, which is met when the spin-lock frequency coincides with a non-zero Fourier component of the stimulus field. In the experiments, we found that magnetic stimuli of different durations and waveforms can be distinguished by their characteristic REX response spectrum. The detected REX amplitude was proportional to the stimulus peak amplitude (R2&gt;0.98) and the lowest field detection was 1 nT. Furthermore, the detection of QRS-like fields with varying QRS durations yielded significant results in a phantom setup (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: REX detection can be transferred to non-sinusoidal pulsed magnetic fields and could provide a non-invasive, quantitative tool for spatially resolved assessment of cardiac biomagnetism. Potential applications include the direct detection and characterization of cardiac conduction.</description>

      <title>Robust, fast and accurate mapping of diffusional mean kurtosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a methodology for measuring the extent of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue, which has shown great promise in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of many neurological diseases and disorders. However, robust, fast and accurate estimation of kurtosis from clinically feasible data acquisitions remains a challenge. In this study, we first outline a new accurate approach of estimating mean kurtosis via the sub-diffusion mathematical framework. Crucially, this extension of the conventional DKI overcomes the limitation on the maximum b-value of the latter. Kurtosis and diffusivity can now be simply computed as functions of the sub-diffusion model parameters. Second, we propose a new fast and robust fitting procedure to estimate the sub-diffusion model parameters using two diffusion times without increasing acquisition time as for the conventional DKI. Third, our sub-diffusion based kurtosis mapping method is evaluated using both simulations and the Connectome 1.0 human brain data. Exquisite tissue contrast is achieved even when the diffusion encoded data is collected in only minutes. In summary, our findings suggest robust, fast and accurate estimation of mean kurtosis can be realised within a clinically feasible diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition time.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS): A Comprehensive Approach to Label-free Absorption Microscopy Across Biological Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques have evolved as effective tools for non-invasive chemical specific structural, and functional imaging. Yet most modern label-free microscopy modalities target only a fraction of the contrast afforded by an optical absorption interaction. We introduce a comprehensive optical absorption microscopy technique, Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), which simultaneously captures the dominant light matter interactions which occur as a pulse of light is absorbed by a molecule. In PARS, the optical scattering, attenuation, and the transient radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes are collected at each optical absorption event. This provides a complete representation of the absorption event, providing unique contrast presented here as the total absorption (TA) and quantum efficiency ratio (QER) measurements. By capturing a complete view of each absorption interaction, PARS bridges many of the specificity challenges associated with label-free imaging, facilitating recovery of a wider range of biomolecules than independent radiative or non-radiative modalities. To show the versatility of PARS, we explore imaging across a wide range of biological specimens, from single cells to in-vivo imaging of living subjects. These examples of label-free histopathological imaging, and vascular imaging illustrate some of the numerous fields where PARS may have profound impacts. Overall PARS may provide comprehensive label-free contrast in a wide variety of biological specimens, providing otherwise inaccessible visualizations, and representing a new a source of rich data to develop new AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.</description>
