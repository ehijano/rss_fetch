      <title>Algebraic localization-delocalization phase transition in moving potential wells on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization and scattering properties of potential wells or barriers uniformly moving on a lattice are strongly dependent on the drift velocity owing to violation of the Galilean invariance of the discrete Schr\"odinger equation. Here a type of localization-delocalization phase transition of algebraic type is unravelled, which does not require any kind of disorder and arises when a power-law potential well drifts fast on a lattice. While for an algebraic exponent $\alpha$ lower than the critical value $\alpha_c=1$ dynamical delocalization is observed, for $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ asymptotic localization, corresponding to an asymptotic frozen dynamics, is instead realized. At the critical phase transition point $\alpha_=\alpha_c=1$ an oscillatory dynamics is found, corresponding to Bloch oscillations. An experimentally-accessible photonic platform for the observation of the predicted algebraic phase transition, based on light dynamics in synthetic mesh lattices, is suggested.</description>

      <title>Dynamical heterogeneity and large deviations in the open quantum East glass model from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as "talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings intuitively explain why highly talented agents are more likely to become central hubs in the network and why social connections tend to form between individuals with similar talent levels (socioeconomic homophily).</description>

      <title>An invariant measure of chiral quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the invariant measure of the transport correlator for a chiral Hamiltonian and analyze its properties. The Jacobian of the invariant measure is a function of random phases. Then we distinguish the invariant measure before and after the phase integration. In the former case we found quantum diffusion of fermions and a uniform zero mode that is associated with particle conservation. After the phase integration the transport correlator reveals two types of evolution processes, namely classical diffusion and back-folded random walks. Which one dominates the other depends on the details of the underlying chiral Hamiltonian and may lead either to classical diffusion or to the suppression of diffusion.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>

      <title>The Underlying Scaling Laws and Universal Statistical Structure of Complex Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal traits which emerge both in real-world complex datasets, as well as in artificially generated ones. Our approach is to analogize data to a physical system and employ tools from statistical physics and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to reveal their underlying structure. We focus on the feature-feature covariance matrix, analyzing both its local and global eigenvalue statistics. Our main observations are: (i) The power-law scalings that the bulk of its eigenvalues exhibit are vastly different for uncorrelated normally distributed data compared to real-world data, (ii) this scaling behavior can be completely modeled by generating Gaussian data with long range correlations, (iii) both generated and real-world datasets lie in the same universality class from the RMT perspective, as chaotic rather than integrable systems, (iv) the expected RMT statistical behavior already manifests for empirical covariance matrices at dataset sizes significantly smaller than those conventionally used for real-world training, and can be related to the number of samples required to approximate the population power-law scaling behavior, (v) the Shannon entropy is correlated with local RMT structure and eigenvalues scaling, is substantially smaller in strongly correlated datasets compared to uncorrelated ones, and requires fewer samples to reach the distribution entropy. These findings show that with sufficient sample size, the Gram matrix of natural image datasets can be well approximated by a Wishart random matrix with a simple covariance structure, opening the door to rigorous studies of neural network dynamics and generalization which rely on the data Gram matrix.</description>
