      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Asynchronous Multi-Agent TD Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research endeavours have theoretically shown the beneficial effect of cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In a setting involving $N$ agents, this beneficial effect usually comes in the form of an $N$-fold linear convergence speedup, i.e., a reduction - proportional to $N$ - in the number of iterations required to reach a certain convergence precision. In this paper, we show for the first time that this speedup property also holds for a MARL framework subject to asynchronous delays in the local agents' updates. In particular, we consider a policy evaluation problem in which multiple agents cooperate to evaluate a common policy by communicating with a central aggregator. In this setting, we study the finite-time convergence of \texttt{AsyncMATD}, an asynchronous multi-agent temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm in which agents' local TD update directions are subject to asynchronous bounded delays. Our main contribution is providing a finite-time analysis of \texttt{AsyncMATD}, for which we establish a linear convergence speedup while highlighting the effect of time-varying asynchronous delays on the resulting convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Architectural Influence on Variational Quantum Circuits in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Evolutionary Strategies for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has found application in numerous areas of science and industry, such as autonomous driving, telecommunications, and global health. Nevertheless, MARL suffers from, for instance, an exponential growth of dimensions. Inherent properties of quantum mechanics help to overcome these limitations, e.g., by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Previous studies have developed an approach that uses gradient-free quantum Reinforcement Learning and evolutionary optimization for variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to reduce the trainable parameters and avoid barren plateaus as well as vanishing gradients. This leads to a significantly better performance of VQCs compared to classical neural networks with a similar number of trainable parameters and a reduction in the number of parameters by more than 97 \% compared to similarly good neural networks. We extend an approach of K\"olle et al. by proposing a Gate-Based, a Layer-Based, and a Prototype-Based concept to mutate and recombine VQCs. Our results show the best performance for mutation-only strategies and the Gate-Based approach. In particular, we observe a significantly better score, higher total and own collected coins, as well as a superior own coin rate for the best agent when evaluated in the Coin Game environment.</description>

      <title>Non-Bayesian Social Learning with Multiview Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning enables multiple agents to conduct networked signal and information processing through observing environmental signals and information aggregating. Traditional non-Bayesian social learning models only consider single signals, limiting their applications in scenarios where multiple viewpoints of information are available. In this work, we exploit, in the information aggregation step, the independently learned results from observations taken from multiple viewpoints and propose a novel non-Bayesian social learning model for scenarios with multiview observations. We prove the convergence of the model under traditional assumptions and provide convergence conditions for the algorithm in the presence of misleading signals. Through theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, we validate the strong reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Fair Incentives for Repeated Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a decision-maker's problem of finding optimal monetary incentive schemes for retention when faced with agents whose participation decisions (stochastically) depend on the incentive they receive. Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent, Human-Agent and Beyond: A Survey on Cooperation in Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of cooperation within social dilemmas has long been a fundamental topic across various disciplines, including computer science and social science. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly reshaped this field, offering fresh insights into understanding and enhancing cooperation. This survey examines three key areas at the intersection of AI and cooperation in social dilemmas. First, focusing on multi-agent cooperation, we review the intrinsic and external motivations that support cooperation among rational agents, and the methods employed to develop effective strategies against diverse opponents. Second, looking into human-agent cooperation, we discuss the current AI algorithms for cooperating with humans and the human biases towards AI agents. Third, we review the emergent field of leveraging AI agents to enhance cooperation among humans. We conclude by discussing future research avenues, such as using large language models, establishing unified theoretical frameworks, revisiting existing theories of human cooperation, and exploring multiple real-world applications.</description>

      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation.
