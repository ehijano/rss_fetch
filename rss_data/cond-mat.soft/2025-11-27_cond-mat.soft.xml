      <title>Memory Effects in Contact Line Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a drop of liquid comes into contact with a solid surface, it relaxes towards an equilibrium configuration, either wetting the surface or remaining in a droplet-like shape with a finite contact angle. The force driving the process towards equilibrium is the corresponding out-of-balance Young's force. However, the speed with which the liquid front advances depends strongly on an opposing friction force arising from dissipative processes due to the moving solid-liquid-gas contact line. In analogy to the treatment of hydrodynamic friction we present an exact method, based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, to extract this friction from equilibrium data. We find that the contact line exhibits long-lasting memory with a characteristic power-law decay due to coupling to the systems hydrodynamic modes. Within linear response regime, we obtain the frequency-dependent dissipative and elastic response of the contact line to an external perturbation, including a frequency-dependent friction coefficient. Similar to hydrodynamic friction in liquids, we find that the friction decreases beyond a characteristic frequency and the system exhibits predominantly elastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Analytical Interaction Potentials for Disks in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact analytical forms are derived for the interactions involving thin disks in two dimensions using an integration approach. These include interactions between a disk and a material point, between two disks, and between a disk and a wall. Each object is treated as a continuous medium of materials points interacting by the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. By integrating this potential in a pairwise manner, expressions for the potentials and resultant forces between extended objects are obtained. All the results are validated with numerical integrations. The analytical potentials are implemented in LAMMPS and used to simulate two-dimensional suspension of disks with an explicit solvent modeled as a Lennard-Jones liquid. In monodisperse disk suspensions, a disorder-to-order transition of disk packing is observed as the area fraction of disks is increased or as the solvent evaporates. In bidisperse disk suspensions being rapidly dried, stratification is found with the smaller disks enriched at the evaporation front. Such "small-on-top" stratification echoes the similar phenomenon occurring in three-dimensional polydisperse colloidal suspensions that undergo fast drying. These potentials can be applied to a wide range of two-dimensional systems involving disk-like objects.</description>

      <title>The metastability of lipid vesicle shapes in uniaxial extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the elastic properties of deflated vesicles and their shape dynamics in uniaxial extensional flow. By analysing the Helfrich bending energy and viscous flow stresses in the limit of highly elongated shapes, we demonstrate that all stationary vesicle configurations are metastable. For vesicles with small reduced volume, we identify the type of bifurcation at which the stationary state is lost, leading to unbounded vesicle elongation in time. We show that the stationary vesicle length remains finite at the critical extension rate. The critical behaviour of the stationary vesicle length and of the growth rates of small perturbations is obtained analytically and confirmed by direct numerical computations. The beginning stage of the unbounded elongation dynamics is simulated numerically, in agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walks pulled at an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate polymers pulled away from an interacting surface, where the force is applied to the untethered endpoint and at an angle $\theta$ to the surface. We use the canonical self-avoiding walk model of polymers and obtain the phase diagram of the model using Monte Carlo simulations for a range of angles, temperatures and force magnitudes. The phase diagram of the model displays re-entrance at low temperatures for three-dimensional walks when the pulling is more vertical than horizontal. Our results agree with various exactly solvable lattice models that have been previously studied.</description>

      <title>Relation between extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions under uniaxial extensional flow using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. At high extension rates, polymers are significantly stretched by extensional flows, and the extensional viscosity growth function exhibits strain hardening. To reveal their quantitative relation, we adopt an analysis method based on the Rouse-type model. We demonstrate that the extensional viscosity growth function is determined by the instantaneous gyration radii in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the extensional direction and their time derivatives. Our approach also provides a unified description of the steady-state extensional viscosity of dilute polymer solutions for various chain lengths and concentrations in terms of the polymer gyration radius.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Charge +1 Topological Defects in Polar Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are a conspicuous feature of active liquid crystals that have been associated with important morphogenetic transitions in organismal development. Robust development thus requires a tight control of the motion and placement of topological defects. In this manuscript, we study a mechanism to control +1 topological defects in an active polar fluid confined to a disk. If activity is localized in an annulus within the disk, the defect moves on a circular trajectory around the center of the disk. Using an ansatz for the polar field, we determine the dependence of the angular speed and the circle radius on the boundary orientation of the polar field and the active annulus. Using a proportional integral controller, we guide the defect along complex trajectories by changing the active annulus size and the boundary orientation.</description>

      <title>The 2/3 Rule of Glass Physics Implies Universalities in Crystal Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since more than 100 years, melting is thought to be governed by the Lindemann criterion. It assumes that a crystal melts when, upon heating, the growing atomic vibration amplitudes become sufficiently large to destabilize its crystalline lattice. However, it is unclear why the viscosities eta or the related relaxation times tau of the resulting liquids, measured directly at the melting point Tm, differ by up to nine decades, depending on the material. Based on the empirical rule that the ratio of the glass-transition temperature and Tm is about 2/3, here we show that this strong variation is due to differences in the liquid's fragilities, a property associated with pronounced non-Arrhenius behavior and often ascribed to cooperative motions. We propose that, without cooperativity, all crystals would melt into liquids with a universal viscosity value and relaxation time. Hence, the real melting point is only partly determined by the Lindemann criterion and strongly enhanced by the cooperativity of the resulting liquid. Our findings are corroborated by the determination of the idealized, fragility-free melting temperatures, and of the corresponding eta and tau values for various example materials.</description>

      <title>Fluidization induced by Magnetic Interactions in Confined Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic active matter in confined geometries using both experiments with magnetic toy robots Hexbugs and simulations of elongated magnetic active Brownian particles in circular domains. Standard active particles tend to accumulate at boundaries, forming clusters even at relatively low densities. In the presence of magnetic interactions, we provide evidence for a fluidization effect that inhibits clustering and shifts its onset to higher packing fractions. Moreover, magnetic dipolar interactions give rise to novel collective behaviors, such as train-like formations, rotating pairs, and particle vortices.</description>

      <title>Rectification of stress by fiber networks: Manifestation of non-linear screening through self-organized buckling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Force transmission at large length scales is crucial for such biological functions as cell motility and morphogenesis. The networks that transmit these forces are malleable, patterned by active forces generated at the microscale by biological motors. In this paper we explore a simple model of a non-linear fiber network which has only two modes of deformation, but exhibits diverse mechanical phases with distinct large-scale response, tuned by the strength of a microscopic force dipole. We demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that the network is remodeled by organized patterns of buckling, which lead to a renormalization of the Poisson ratio. Finally, we show that the emergent behavior at large length scales can be ascribed to "mechanical screening" of the force dipole, analogous to dielectric screening of charges in electrostatics.</description>

      <title>White light interferometry analysis for measuring thin film thickness down to few nanometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical white-light interferometric method, supported by an open-source Python library \textit{optifik} for automated spectrum-to-thickness deduction, enabling foam film measurements down to a few nanometers. We describe three typical spectral scenarii encountered in this method: spectra exhibiting numerous interference fringes, spectra with a moderate number of peaks, and spectra with only a few identifiable features, providing illustrative examples for each case. We also discuss the main limitations of the technique, including spectral range constraints, the necessity of knowing the refractive index, and the influence of spectral resolution and signal quality. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method in a time-resolved study of a TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) foam film undergoing elongation and thinning. This method can be adapted to measure any thin non-opaque layer.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a tracer trapped in a correlated medium in the presence of a wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the random motion of a particle immersed in a thermally fluctuating medium and harmonically trapped at a certain distance from a wall. The medium, modeled by a Gaussian field with a tunable correlation length $\xi$, is linearly coupled to the particle and evolves according to dissipative relaxational dynamics. Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations: impact of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.</description>

      <title>Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organization and Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition graphs capture the memory and sequential response of multistable media, by specifying their evolution under external driving. Microscopically, collections of bistable elements, or hysterons, provide a powerful model for these materials, with recent work highlighting the crucial role of hysteron interactions. Here, we introduce a general framework that links transition graphs and the microscopic parameters of interacting hysterons. We first introduce a systematic framework, based on so-called scaffolds, which structures the space of transition graphs and provides tools to deal with their combinatorial explosion. We then connect the topology of transition graphs to partial orders of the microscopic parameters. This allows us to understand the statistical properties of transition graphs, as well as determine whether a given graph is realizable, i.e. compatible with the hysteron framework. Our approach paves the way for a deeper theoretical understanding of memory effects in complex media and opens a route to rationally design pathways and memory effects in materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active turbulence arises typically in systems ranging from microorganisms and biopolymers to synthetic colloids, where chaotic flows are closely associated with motile topological defects in collectively swarming suspensions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of turbulence in a fundamentally different class of systems: dense monolayers of motile unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exhibit neither orientational order nor topological defects. Nevertheless, the system displays rich spatiotemporal flow patterns with pronounced small-scale intermittency. We uncover strongly non-Gaussian velocity distribution, a feature distinct from both bacterial and classical fluid turbulence. Furthermore, we observe power-law regimes in the kinetic energy spectra, characterized by unique scaling exponents. Not only do our results provide compelling evidence for active turbulence in systems devoid of nematic or polar structures, but they also challenge current theoretical models. Our work opens new avenues for understanding emergent dynamics in active-matter systems and suggests intriguing biological implications, including enhanced mixing and transport in dense cell suspensions.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.</description>

Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Chirality, confinement and dimensionality govern re-entrant transitions in active matter</title>

Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of individual chiral active particles underpin the complex behavior of chiral active matter. Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.</description>

      <title>Surface wakes on ultra-soft solids</title>

Abstract: We explore the dynamical response of the free surface of an ultra-soft solid driven by a localized moving pressure disturbance. Experiments reveal a steady V-shaped wake analogous to a surface Mach wedge. A simple geometric argument provides a qualitative explanation consistent with observations. A theoretical framework combining elastodynamic, capillary, and gravitational effects yields a generalized dispersion relation that smoothly interpolates between Kelvin's theory of liquid interface wakes and Rayleigh's theory of elastic surface waves. Together, our experiments and theory reveal the existence of a soft wake regime that bridges fluid and solid surface wave physics, offering new routes for probing the dynamics of soft surfaces.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of flat-foldable thick origami with smooth curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom.</description>

      <title>How elasticity affects bubble pinch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These \textit{recognition} sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Simulating droplet adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing superhydrophobic surface topography using droplet adhesion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.</description>
