      <title>Sulfate phantoms to mimic NIR photoacoustic response of whole blood at selected oxygen saturations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical guide to prepare inorganic solutions that mimic the photoacoustic properties of whole blood at specific levels of oxygenation in the range of 700 nm to 850 nm, both in terms of optical absorption properties and the Gr{\"u}neisen coefficient. The goal is to provide aqueous solutions that can be injected in tissue-mimicking imaging phantoms to test the sensitivity and spectral capabilities of photoacoustic imaging systems operating at multiple wavelengths to estimate blood oxygenation.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Vendor-Specific Approach for Standardized Uptake Value Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is a critical metric in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, used to assess metabolic activity. However, calculating SUV from DICOM files presents challenges due to vendor-specific DICOM attributes and variations in the encoding of radiotracer accumulation times. This technical note introduces a robust, vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy that addresses inconsistencies in current methodologies. We also integrate this strategy into an open-source software solution, Z-Rad, capable of converting raw PET DICOM data into body-weight normalized SUV NIfTI files.
  Our SUV calculation strategy was developed by reviewing DICOM conformance statements from GE, Philips, and Siemens. Validation was conducted using real-world PET datasets, and the proposed strategy was compared to existing software solutions.
  Our SUV calculation approach demonstrated improved accuracy, particularly in resolving time-related discrepancies in the studied data. Our analysis also identified inconsistencies in the SUV calculation methods used by popular commercial and open-source software solutions, which do not fully account for vendor-specific DICOM attributes and PET image acquisition times. These limitations resulted in errors in SUV estimation reaching 33\% when comparing our strategy to studied software.
  The proposed vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy significantly enhances accuracy in PET imaging by addressing key inconsistencies caused by variations in DICOM attributes and image acquisition times across different vendors. This method effectively reduces SUV calculation errors and has been integrated into an open-source software, Z-Rad.</description>

      <title>Velocity Spectrum Imaging using velocity encoding preparation pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The goal of this article is to introduce a technique to measure the velocity distribution of water inside each voxel of an MR image. The method is based on the use of motion sensitizing gradients with changing first moment to encode velocity. As such, it is completely non-invasive and requires no contrast injections.
  Methods: The technique consists of acquiring a series of images preceded by preparatory RF pulses that encode velocity information, analogously to k-space encoding. The velocity distribution can be decoded via the Fourier transform. We demonstrate its use on a simple flow phantom with known flow characteristics. We demonstrate the technique on the brains of five human participants from whom we collected the velocity distribution along each of the three laboratory axes.
  Results: Velocity distribution measurements on simple phantoms yielded velocity distributions consistent with theory. Human velocity spectra identified specific anatomical features at different velocity bins. The largest fraction of spins was in the lowest velocity bands. Movement in the CSF spaces could be clearly identified at different velocity bands.
  Conclusion: Velocity Spectrum Imaging has great potential as a tool to study the movement of fluids in the human body without contrast agents. In addition to a useful tool for validating computational fluid dynamic models in vivo, it can be used to study the complex movement of water in the glymphatic system and its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders. However, further development is needed to probe the velocity spectrum in the ultra-low velocity regime of the perivascular spaces.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Sensitive Module for Optical Coherence Tomography Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and the human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.</description>
