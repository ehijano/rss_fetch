      <title>On generating functions and automata associated to reflections in Coxeter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study two combinatorial problems concerning the set of reflections of a Coxeter system. The first problem asks whether the language of palindromic reduced words for reflections is regular, and the second is about finding formulas for the Poincar\'e series of reflections, namely the generating function of reflection lengths. These two problems were inspired by a conjecture of Stembridge stating that the Poincar\'e series of reflections is rational and by the solution provided by de Man.
  To address the first problem, we introduce reflection-prefixes, arising naturally from palindromic reduced words. We study their connections with the root poset, dominance order on roots, and dihedral reflection subgroups. Using $m$-canonical automata associated with $m$-Shi arrangements, we prove that the language of reduced words for reflection-prefixes is regular. For the second problem, we focus on affine Coxeter groups. In this case, we derive a simple formula for the Poincar\'e series using symmetries of the Hasse diagram of the root poset.</description>

      <title>Fit systolic groups, exactly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systolic complex/bridged graph is fit when its (metric) intervals are "not too large". We prove that uniformly locally finite fit systolic complexes have Yu's Property A. In particular, groups acting properly on such complexes have Property A, (equivalently) they are exact, and (equivalently) they are boundary amenable. As applications we show that groups from a class containing all large-type Artin groups, as well as all finitely presented graphical $C(3)$--$T(6)$ small cancellation groups, and finitely presented classical $C(6)$ small cancellation groups are exact. We also provide further examples. Our proof relies on a combinatorial criterion for Property~A due to \v{S}pakula and Wright.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in finitely generated groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To each finitely generated group $G$, we associate a quasi-isometric invariant called the \emph{Dehn spectrum} of $G$. If $G$ is finitely presented, our invariant is closely related to the Dehn function of $G$, but provides more information by encoding the isoperimetric behavior of $G$ at various scales. The main goal of this paper is to initiate the study of the Dehn spectrum of finitely generated (but not necessarily finitely presented) groups. In particular, we compute the Dehn spectrum of small cancellation groups, certain wreath products, and free Burnside groups of sufficiently large odd exponent. We also address several natural questions concerning the structure of the poset of Dehn spectra. As an application, we show that there exist $2^{\aleph_0}$ pairwise non-quasi-isometric finitely generated groups of finite exponent.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of $S$-arithmetic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the sign of the Euler characteristic of an $S$-arithmetic subgroup of a simple algebraic group depends on the $S$-congruence completion only, except possibly in type ${}^6 D_4$. Consequently, the sign is a profinite invariant for such $S$-arithmetic groups with the congruence subgroup property. This generalizes previous work of the first author with Kionke--Raimbault--Sauer.</description>

      <title>Subgroup mixing in Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>Bochner-type theorems for distributional category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in the presence of a geometric condition such as non-negative Ricci curvature, the distributional category of a manifold may be used to bound invariants, such as the first Betti number and macroscopic dimension, from above. Moreover, \`a la Bochner, when the bound is an equality, special constraints are imposed on the manifold. We show that the distributional category of a space also bounds the rank of the Gottlieb group, with equality imposing constraints on the fundamental group. These bounds are refined in the setting of cohomologically symplectic manifolds, enabling us to get specific computations for the distributional category and LS-category.</description>

      <title>Handlebodies, Outer space, and tropical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of graphs $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ is a polyhedral object that mimics the behavior of the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$, $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ of (stable) Riemann surfaces; this relationship has been made precise in several different ways, which collectively identify $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ as the "tropicalization" of $M_{g,n}$. We describe how this relationship lifts to some objects that live over $M_{g,n}$ (like Teichm\"uller space) and that live over $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ (like the Culler-Vogtmann space $CV_{g,n}^*$). We introduce the notion of a stable complex handlebody, and show that $CV_{g,n}^*$ can be viewed as the tropicalization of a certain complex manifold $hT(V_{g,n})$ that parametrizes complex handlebodies. An important ingredient is our construction of a partial compactification $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})\supset hT(V_{g,n})$, which we prove is a simply connected complex manifold with simple normal crossings boundary. When $n=0$, $hT(V_{g,n})$ coincides with the moduli space of Schottky groups, $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})$ coincides with Gerritzen-Herrlich's extended Schottky space, and $CV_{g,0}^*$ is the simplicial completion of the original Outer space. The resulting picture fits together many familiar objects from geometric group theory and surface topology, including Harvey's curve complex, mapping class groups of surfaces and handlebodies, and augmented Teichm\"uller space. Many of the relationships between the objects that we see in this picture already exist in the literature, but we add some new ones, and generalize several existing relationships to include a number $n&gt;0$ of punctures/leaves.</description>
