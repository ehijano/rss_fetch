      <title>What Is a Causal Effect When Firms Interact? Counterfactuals and Interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many empirical studies estimate causal effects in environments where economic units interact through spatial or network connections. In such settings, outcomes are jointly determined, and treatment induced shocks propagate across economically connected units. A growing literature highlights identification challenges in these models and questions the causal interpretation of estimated spillovers. This paper argues that the problem is more fundamental. Under interdependence, causal effects are not uniquely defined objects even when the interaction structure is correctly specified or consistently learned, and even under ideal identifying conditions. We develop a causal framework for firm-level economies in which interaction structures are unobserved but can be learned from predetermined characteristics. We show that learning the network, while necessary to model interdependence, is not sufficient for causal interpretation. Instead, causal conclusions hinge on explicit counterfactual assumptions governing how outcomes adjust following a treatment change. We formalize three economically meaningful counterfactual regimes partial equilibrium, local interaction, and network, consistent equilibrium, and show that standard spatial autoregressive estimates map into distinct causal effects depending on the counterfactual adopted. We derive identification conditions for each regime and demonstrate that equilibrium causal effects require substantially stronger assumptions than direct or local effects. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates that equilibrium and partial-equilibrium effects differ mechanically even before estimation, and that network feedback can amplify bias when identifying assumptions fail. Taken together, our results clarify what existing spatial and network estimators can and cannot identify and provide practical guidance for empirical research in interdependent economic environments</description>

      <title>Effect of Informational Interventions on EV Adoption Intention: Evidence from a Tier II City in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of targeted informational interventions on electric vehicle adoption intention. A randomised controlled field experiment with three treatment groups and a control group was used to study the effectiveness of three informational interventions. Participants in each treatment group received a distinct informational intervention: cost-based, range-based, and norm-based. Two of the three interventions (range-based and norm-based), designed to reduce behavioural and psychological barriers, were found to be significant. The cost-based intervention was not significant, suggesting that financial motives alone may not be sufficient to lead to an increase in the adoption of electric vehicles. The significant effect observed for the range-based and norm-based interventions suggests that the discomfort related to the technology must be addressed, and social norms can be effectively utilised to promote electric vehicles at low cost. Although adoption is not guaranteed with self-reported intentions, the findings suggest that carefully framed informational interventions guide behavioural intentions towards sustainable technologies. The most significant contribution of the study is to the literature on demand-side policy instruments, which suggests that financial incentives can be complemented by other informational interventions to accelerate the adoption of sustainable mobility.</description>

      <title>TWICE: Tree-based Wage Inference with Clustering and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much do worker skills, firm pay policies, and their interaction contribute to wage inequality? Standard approaches rely on latent fixed effects identified through worker mobility, but sparse networks inflate variance estimates, additivity assumptions rule out complementarities, and the resulting decompositions lack interpretability. We propose TWICE (Tree-based Wage Inference with Clustering and Estimation), a framework that models the conditional wage function directly from observables using gradient-boosted trees, replacing latent effects with interpretable, observable-anchored partitions. This trades off the ability to capture idiosyncratic unobservables for robustness to sampling noise and out-of-sample portability. Applied to Portuguese administrative data, TWICE outperforms linear benchmarks out of sample and reveals that sorting and non-additive interactions explain substantially more wage dispersion than implied by standard AKM estimates.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Trust: A Stochastic Levy Model Capturing Sudden Behavioral Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust is the invisible glue that holds together the fabric of societies, economic systems, and political institutions. Yet, its dynamics-especially in real-world settings remain unpredictable and difficult to control. While classical trust game models largely rely on discrete frameworks with limited noise, they fall short in capturing sudden behavioral shifts, extreme volatility, or abrupt breakdowns in cooperation.Here, we propose-for the first time a comprehensive stochastic model of trust based on L\'evy processes that integrates three fundamental components: Brownian motion (representing everyday fluctuations), Poissonian jump intensity (capturing the frequency of shocks), and random distributions for jump magnitudes. This framework surpasses conventional models by enabling simulations of phenomena such as "sudden trust collapse," "chaotic volatility," and "nonlinear recoveries" dynamics often neglected in both theoretical and empirical studies.By implementing four key simulation scenarios and conducting a detailed parameter sensitivity analysis via 3D and contour plots, we demonstrate that the proposed model is not only mathematically more advanced, but also offers a more realistic representation of human dynamics compared to previous approaches. Beyond its technical contributions, this study outlines a conceptual framework for understanding fragile, jump-driven behaviors in social, economic, and geopolitical systems-where trust is not merely a psychological construct, but an inherently unstable and stochastic variable best captured through L\'evy based modeling.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Combinatorial Efficient Frontiers: Investment Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investment portfolio optimization is a task conducted in all major financial institutions. The Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (CCPO) problem formulation is ubiquitous for portfolio optimization. The challenge of this type of portfolio optimization, a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, arises from the intractability of solutions from exact solvers, where heuristic algorithms are used to find approximate portfolio solutions. CCPO entails many laborious and complex workflows and also requires extensive effort pertaining to heuristic algorithm development, where the combination of pooled heuristic solutions results in improved efficient frontiers. Hence, common approaches are to develop many heuristic algorithms. Agentic frameworks emerge as a promising candidate for many problems within combinatorial optimization, as they have been shown to be equally efficient with regard to automating large workflows and have been shown to be excellent in terms of algorithm development, sometimes surpassing human-level performance. This study implements a novel agentic framework for the CCPO and explores several concrete architectures. In benchmark problems, the implemented agentic framework matches state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, complex workflows and algorithm development efforts are alleviated, while in the worst case, lower but acceptable error is reported.</description>
