      <title>5 Year Update to the Next Steps in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been 5 years since the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) Workshop on Next Steps in Quantum Computing, and significant progress has been made in closing the gap between useful quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. Yet much remains to be done, in particular in terms of mitigating errors and moving towards error-corrected machines. As we begin to transition from the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era to a future of fault-tolerant machines, now is an opportune time to reflect on how to apply what we have learned thus far and what research needs to be done to realize computational advantage with quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Making High-Level AI Design Decisions Explicit Using a Binary Stream System-Designation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some crucial decisions in AI design tend to be overlooked or factor choices are assumed implicitly. The question often answered first is what the AI will do, not how it will interact with the rest of the world. This reduces our understanding of the possible types of AI that can be developed and their potential impacts on humanity. As an initial AI taxonomy, I present binary choices for 10 of the subjectively most separable and influential high-level design factors, then give brief examples of several of the 1024 possible systems defined by those choices. This supports a simple binary stream approach to system designation based on translating the stream of choices into decimal notation, giving a short-hand way of referring to systems with different properties that meet specialized needs. Further, underspecified or generic systems can be designated using the binary stream approach as well, a notational feature that supports modeling the impacts of AI systems with selected characteristics.</description>

      <title>Long-Term or Temporary? Hybrid Worker Recruitment for Mobile Crowd Sensing and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel hybrid worker recruitment problem where the mobile crowd sensing and computing (MCSC) platform employs workers to serve MCSC tasks with diverse quality requirements and budget constraints, under uncertainties in workers' participation and their local workloads.We propose a hybrid worker recruitment framework consisting of offline and online trading modes. The former enables the platform to overbook long-term workers (services) to cope with dynamic service supply via signing contracts in advance, which is formulated as 0-1 integer linear programming (ILP) with probabilistic constraints of service quality and budget.Besides, motivated by the existing uncertainties which may render long-term workers fail to meet the service quality requirement of each task, we augment our methodology with an online temporary worker recruitment scheme as a backup Plan B to support seamless service provisioning for MCSC tasks, which also represents a 0-1 ILP problem. To tackle these problems which are proved to be NP-hard, we develop three algorithms, namely, i) exhaustive searching, ii) unique index-based stochastic searching with risk-aware filter constraint, iii) geometric programming-based successive convex algorithm, which achieve the optimal or sub-optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate our effectiveness in terms of service quality, time efficiency, etc.</description>
