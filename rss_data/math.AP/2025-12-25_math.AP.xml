      <title>Dispersive decay for the Inter-critical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in the mass-supercritical and energy-subcritical regime within three spatial dimensions. For initial data in the critical homogeneous Sobolev space $\dot{H}^{s_c}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ (where $s_c = \frac{5}{6}$), we get a uniform decay estimate for the long-time dynamics of solutions, which extends the previous results.</description>

      <title>On a Hamilton-Jacobi PDE theory for hydrodynamic limit of action minimizing collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish multi-scale convergence theory for a class of Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs in space of probability measures. They arise from context of hydrodynamic limit of N-particle deterministic action minimizing (global) Lagrangian dynamics.
  From a Lagrangian point of view, this can also be viewed as a limit result on two scale convergence of action minimizing probability-measure-valued paths. However, we focus on the Hamiltonian formulation here mostly. We derive and study convergence of the associated abstract but scalar Hamilton-Jacobi equations, defined in space of probability measures. There is an infinite dimensional singular averaging structure within these equations. We develop an indirect variational approach to apply finite dimensional weak K.A.M. theory to such infinite dimensional setting here. With a weakly interacting particle assumption, the averaging step only involves that of individual particles, which is implicitly but rigorously treated using the weak K.A.M. theory. Consequently, we can close the above mentioned averaging step by identifying limiting Hamiltonian, and arrive at a rigorous convergence result on solutions of the nonlinear PDEs in space of probability measures.
  In technical development parts of the paper, we devise new viscosity solution techniques regarding projection of equations with a submetry structure in state space, multi-scale convergence for certain abstract Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces, as well as comparison principles for equations in space of probability measures. The space of probability measure we consider is a special case of Alexandrov metric space with curvature bounded from below. Since some results are better explained in such metric space setting, we also develop some techniques in the general settings which are of independent interests.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions and asymptotics for resonant oscillatory problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of oscillatory resonant problems, involving Dirichlet problems for semilinear PDE's on balls and rectangles in $R^n$, we show the existence of infinitely many solutions, and study the global solution set. The first harmonic of the right hand side is not required to be zero, or small. We also derive asymptotic formulas in terms of the first harmonic of solutions, and illustrate their accuracy by numerical computations. The numerical method is explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for the Homogeneous Landau-Coulomb Equation in $L^{3/2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of $H$-solutions to the homogeneous Landau-Coulomb equation satisfying $\langle v \rangle^{k_0} f \in C([0, T]; L^{3/2}(\mathbb{R}^3))$ and $\langle v \rangle^{-3/2} \nabla_v ((\langle v \rangle^{k_0} f)^{3/4}) \in L^2((0, T) \times \mathbb{R}^3)$ for any $k_0 \geq 5$. In particular, this shows that the solutions constructed in~\cite{GGL25} are unique. The present work thus completes the global well-posedness theory in the critical space $L^{3/2}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. Our proof is part of a broader effort to use the $\mathcal{M}$-operator technique developed in~\cite{AGS2025, AMSY2020} to establish the uniqueness of rough solutions to nonlinear kinetic equations. When applied to the space-homogeneous case, the $\mathbb{M}$-operator can be taken simply as a Bessel potential operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative bounds for H\"older exponents in the Krylov--Safonov and Evans--Krylov theories when the ellipticity ratio is close to one. Our analysis relies on the Ishii--Lions method for the Krylov--Safonov theory and a Schauder-type perturbation argument for the Evans--Krylov theory.</description>

      <title>Calder\'on-Zygmund gradient estimates for $p$-Laplace systems with BMO complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with global gradient bounds for a class of divergence-form degenerate elliptic systems with complex-valued coefficients. Notably, the leading coefficients are merely required to be sufficiently small in BMO, which is strictly weaker than the VMO condition. In the complex setting, the well-posedness of this problem was recently investigated in [W. Kim, M. Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions. In our study, it has already been observed that gaining existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is possible under a natural and less restrictive assumption on the complex-valued coefficients. Following this direction, we prove a global Cader\'on-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence. This paper is a contribution to the better understanding of solution behavior and may be viewed as part of a series of works aimed at extending regularity theory in the complex-valued setting.</description>

      <title>A Unified Truncation Method for Infinitely Many Solutions Without Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence of infinitely many solutions for nonlinear problems without any symmetry, achieving three major advances. First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line.
  The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Configurations and their Uniqueness in a Fluid-Solid Interaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence in the ``large" and uniqueness in the ``small" of equilibrium configurations for the coupled system consisting of a Navier-Stokes fluid interacting with a rigid body subjected to spring forces and restoring moments. The driving mechanism is a uniform, given velocity field of the fluid at large spatial distances from the body. The main difficulty in the proof of the above properties arises from the fact that the body can rotate around a given axis, which produces a highly nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence phenomena for nonlinear elliptic equations with $L^1$ data and singular reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and non-existence of solutions for singular elliptic boundary value problems as \begin{equation}\label{eintro}\begin{cases}\tag{1}
  \displaystyle -\Delta_p u+ \frac{a(x)}{u^{\gamma}}=\mu f(x) \ &amp;\text{ in }\Omega, \newline
  u&gt;0&amp;\text{ in }\Omega, \newline
  u = 0 \ &amp;\text{ on }
  \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\ge 2$), $\Delta_p u$ is the $p$-Laplacian with $p&gt;1$, $0&lt;\gamma\leq 1$, and $a\geq0$ is bounded and non-trivial. For any positive $ f\in L^{1}(\Omega)$ we show that problem \eqref{eintro} is solvable for any $\mu &gt;\mu_0&gt;0$, for some $\mu_0$ large enough. As a reciprocal outcome we also show that no finite energy solution exists if $0&lt;\mu&lt;\mu_{0*}$, for some small $\mu_{0*}$.
  This paper extends the celebrated one of J. I. Diaz, J. M. Morel and L. Oswald ([16]) to the case $p\neq2$. Our result is also new for $p=2$ provided the singular term has a critical growth near zero (i.e. $\gamma=1$).</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and the \L{}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality in the asymptotic analysis of a nonlinear heat equation with constraints of finite codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global well-posedness of the $D(A)-$valued strong solution to a nonlinear heat equation with constraints on a \textit{Poincar\'e domain} $\bO\subset \R^d$ whose boundary is of class $C^2$. Consider the following nonlinear heat equation
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \Delta u + |u|^{p-2}u = 0,
  \end{align*}
  projected onto the tangent space $T_u\bM$, where
  $\mathcal{M}:=\left\{u\in L^2(\bO):\|u\|_{L^2(\bO)}=1\right\}$ is a submanifold of $L^2(\bO)$. The nonlinearity exponent satisfies $2\le p &lt; \infty$ for $1\leq d\leq 4$ and $2 \le p \le \frac{2d-4}{d-4}$ for $d \ge 5$. The solution is constrained to lie within $\mathcal{M}$ which encodes the norm-preserving constraint. By modifying the nonlinearity and exploiting the abstract theory for \textit{$m-$accretive }evolution equations, we prove the existence of a global strong solution.
  Using {resolvent-idea } and the \textit{Yosida approximation} method, we derive regularity results. In the asymptotic analysis, $\bO$ is restricted to bounded domains with even $p$
  and $1\le d \le 3$. For any initial data in $D(A) \cap \mathcal{M}$, we apply the \textit{\L{}ojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality} on a Hilbert submanifold [F. Rupp, \textit{J. Funct. Anal.}, 279(8), 2020], to demonstrate that the unique global strong solution converges in $W^{2,q}(\bO) \cap W^{1,q}_0(\bO)$ to a stationary state, where $2 \le q &lt; \frac{2d}{d + 4 - 4\beta}$ and $1 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac{3}{2}$.
  This work proposes an alternative method for establishing the global existence and analyzing long-term behavior of the unique strong solution to an $L^2-$norm preserving nonlinear heat equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardy-weights for the Finsler $p$-Dirichlet integral with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an integer $n\geq 2$, an exponent $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, and a domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Let $\Omega^{*}\triangleq\Omega\setminus\{\hat{x}\}$ where $\hat{x}\in\Omega$. Under some further conditions, we construct optimal Hardy-weights for the Finsler $p$-Dirichlet integral $$Q_{0}[\phi;\Omega^{*}]\triangleq\int_{\Omega^{*}}H(x,\nabla \phi)^{p}\,\mathrm{d}x\quad \mbox{on}\quad C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega^{*}),$$ and the Finsler $p$-Dirichlet integral with a potential $$Q_{V}[\phi;\Omega]\triangleq\int_{\Omega}\left(H(x,\nabla \phi)^{p}+ V|\phi|^{p}\right)\,\mathrm{d}x\quad \mbox{on}\quad C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega),$$where $H(x,\cdot)$ is a family of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ parameterized by $x\in\Omega^{*}$ or $x\in\Omega$, respectively, and the potential $V$ lies in a subspace $\widehat{M}^{q}_{{\rm loc}}(p;\Omega)$ of a local Morrey space $M^{q}_{{\rm loc}}(p;\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system in a $3$D perforated domain with free slip and source term: Existence and homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a diffuse-interface model for a binary incompressible mixture in a periodically perforated porous medium, described by a time-dependent Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system posed on the pore domain $\Omega_p^\varepsilon\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. The microscopic model involves a variable viscosity tensor, a non-conservative source term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, and mixed boundary conditions: no-slip on the outer boundary and Navier slip with zero tangential stress on the surfaces of the solid inclusions. The capillarity strength $\lambda^\varepsilon&gt;0$ depends on the microscopic scale $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
  The analysis consists of two main parts. First, for each fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove the existence of a weak solution on a finite time interval $(0,T)$ and derive a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to $\varepsilon$ (and $\lambda^\varepsilon$). Second, we perform the periodic homogenization for the perforated setting, a limit $\varepsilon\to0$. Depending on the limit value $\lambda$ of the capillarity strength $\lambda^\varepsilon$, we obtain two distinct effective models: (i) in the vanishing capillarity regime $\lambda=0$, the limit system is of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard type, with no macroscopic convection or advection; (ii) in the balanced regime $\lambda\in(0,+\infty)$, we derive a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with nonlinear convection and advective transport of the phase field at the macroscopic scale. Finally, we establish the convergence of the microscopic free energy to a homogenized energy functional satisfying an analogous dissipation law.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Existence and Behavior of Solutions to the Inhomogeneous Kinetic FPU Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous kinetic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) equation, a nonlinear transport equation describing the evolution of phonon density distributions with four-phonon interactions. The equation combines free transport in physical space with a nonlinear collision operator acting in momentum space and exhibiting structural degeneracies. We develop a functional framework that captures the interplay between spatial transport and the degeneracies arising in the collision operator. A key ingredient of the analysis is a dispersive estimate for the transport flow, which quantifies decay effects generated by spatial propagation. Using this dispersive mechanism, we obtain improved bounds for the nonlinear collision operator and show that small solutions near the vacuum can be propagated on time scales significantly longer than those dictated by conservation laws alone. In particular, dispersion allows one to extend the classical quadratic lifespan to a quartic time scale.</description>

      <title>Green's Function and Solution Representation for a Boundary Value Problem Involving the Prabhakar Fractional Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a first boundary value problem for a second-order partial differential equation involving the Prabhakar fractional derivative in time. Using structural properties of the Prabhakar kernel and generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, we reduce the problem to a Volterra type integral equation. This reduction enables the explicit construction of the corresponding Green's function. Based on the obtained Green's function, we derive a closed-form integral representation of the solution and prove its existence and uniqueness. The results extend classical Green-function techniques to a wider class of fractional operators and provide analytical tools for further study of boundary and inverse problems associated with Prabhakar-type fractional differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nth-level Prabhakar fractional derivative, a generalization encompassing some well-known fractional derivatives. We establish its fundamental properties, particularly its relationship with the corresponding Prabhakar fractional integral. Furthermore, we develop Mikusinski-type operational calculus for this derivative, providing a framework for solving differential equations involving this operator. To illustrate its application, we present analytical solutions of two problems: a fractional order ordinary differential equation and the time fractional heat equation, both of which include the nth-level Prabhakar derivative.</description>

      <title>Non-Algebraic Decay for Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around forty years ago, Michael Wiegner provided, in a seminal paper, sharp algebraic decay rates for solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations, showing that these solutions behave asymptotically like the solutions of the heat equation with the same data as $t\to+\infty$, in the $L^2$-norm, up to some critical decay rate. In the present paper, we close a gap that appears in the conclusion of Wiegner's theorem in the 2D case, for solutions with non-algebraic decay rate.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the discrete p-Laplacian with density on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonstationary discrete p-Laplacian with inhomogeneous density \r{ho}(x) on an infinite graph which supports the Sobolev inequality. For nonnegative solutions when p &gt; 2, we prove the precise rate of stabilization in time, provided \r{ho}(x) is a non-power function. When p &gt; 2 and \r{ho}(x) goes to zero fast enough, we prove the universal bound. Our technique relies on suitable energy inequalities and a new embedding result.</description>

      <title>Propagation Estimates for the Boson Star Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the boson star equation with a general two-body interaction potential $w$ and initial data $\psi_0$ in a Sobolev space. Under general assumptions on $w$, namely that $w$ decomposes as a sum of a finite, signed measure and an essentially bounded function, we prove that the (local in time) solution cannot propagate faster than the speed of light, up to a sharp exponentially small remainder term. If $w$ is short-range and $\psi_0$ is regular and small enough, we prove in addition asymptotic phase-space propagation estimates and minimal velocity estimates for the (global in time) solution, depending on the momentum of the scattering state associated to $\psi_0$.</description>

      <title>The space spinor formalism and estimates for spinor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the space spinor formalism for 2-component spinors can be used to construct estimates for spinor fields satisfying first order equations. We discuss the connection of the approach presented in this article with other strategies for the construction of estimates. In addition, we recast several concepts related to the notion of hyperbolicity in the context of spinor equations. The approach described in this article can be regarded as an adaptation to first order equations of the method of positive commutators for second order hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Symmetry-Protected Bound States in the Continuum in Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis for symmetry-based Bound States in the Continuum (BICs) in optical waveguide arrays. Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Einstein 5-manifolds via 4-dimensional gap theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the regularity of noncollapsed limits of 5-dimensional manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. In particular, for noncollapsed limits of Einstein 5-manifolds, we prove that
  (1) tangent cones are unique of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ on the top stratum, hence outside a countable set of points,
  (2) the singular set is entirely contained in a countable union of Lipschitz curves and points,
  (3) away from a nowhere dense subset, these Lipschitz curves consist of smooth geodesics,
  (4) the interior of any geodesic is removable: limits of Einstein manifolds are real-analytic orbifolds with singularities along geodesic and bounded curvature away from their extreme points, and
  (5) if an asymptotically Ricci-flat 5-manifold with Euclidean volume growth has one tangent cone at infinity that splits off a line, then it is the unique tangent cone at infinity.
  These results prompt the question of the orbifold regularity of noncollapsed limits of Einstein manifolds off a codimension 5 set in arbitrary dimension.
  The proofs rely on a new result of independent interest: all spherical and hyperbolic 4-orbifolds are isolated among Einstein 4-orbifolds in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This yields various gap theorems for Einstein 4-orbifolds, which do not extend to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems derived from kinetic theory for Multiple Sclerosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical study for the development of Multiple Sclerosis in which a spatio-temporal kinetic { theory} model describes, at the mesoscopic level, the dynamics of a high number of interacting agents. We consider both interactions among different populations of human cells and the motion of immune cells, stimulated by cytokines. Moreover, we reproduce the consumption of myelin sheath due to anomalously activated lymphocytes and its restoration by oligodendrocytes. Successively, we fix a small time parameter and assume that the considered processes occur at different scales. This allows us to perform a formal limit, obtaining macroscopic reaction-diffusion equations for the number densities with a chemotaxis term. A natural step is then to study the system, inquiring about the formation of spatial patterns through a Turing instability analysis of the problem and basing the discussion on the microscopic parameters of the model. In particular, we get spatial patterns oscillating in time that may reproduce brain lesions characteristic of different phases of the pathology.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the unique existence of an axisymmetric supersonic solution with nonzero vorticity and nonzero angular momentum density for the steady Euler-Poisson system in three-dimensional divergent nozzles when prescribing the velocity, strength of electric field, and the entropy at the entrance. We first reformulate the problem via the method of the Helmholtz decomposition for three-dimensional axisymmetric flows and obtain a solution to the reformulated problem by the iteration method. Furthermore, we deal carefully with singularity issues related to the polar angle on the axis of the divergent nozzle.</description>

      <title>Proving symmetry of localized solutions and application to dihedral patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the framework developed in \cite{unbounded_domain_cadiot} to allow for rigorous proofs of existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear partial differential equations possessing both space and non-space group symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on the Swift-Hohenberg model. In particular, for a given symmetry group $\mathcal{G}$, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l_{\mathcal{G}}$ containing only functions with $\mathcal{G}$-symmetry. In this space, products and differential operators are well-defined allowing for the study of autonomous semi-linear PDEs. Depending on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $u_0$. More specifically, combining a meticulous analysis and computer-assisted techniques, the Newton-Kantorovich approach is validated thanks to the computation of some explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $u_0$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will depend on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$ and its maximal square lattice space subgroup, $\mathcal{H}$. More specifically, we consider three cases: $\mathcal{G}$ is a space group which can be represented on the square lattice, $\mathcal{G}$ is not a space group which can be represented on the square lattice and the symmetry of $\mathcal{H}$ isolates the solution, and where $\mathcal{G}$ is not a space group which can be represented on the square lattice and the symmetry of $\mathcal{H}$ does not isolate the solution. We demonstrate the methodology on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of various dihedral localized patterns. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs can be found on Github.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of two partially miscible, nonhomogeneous, incompressible viscous fluids of non-Newtonian type, can be governed by the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system. In the present work, we prove the global existence of weak solutions for the case of initial density containing zero and the concentration depending viscosity with free energy potential equal to the Landau potential in a bounded domain of three dimensions. Furthermore, we show that a strong solutions exist locally in time in the case of three dimensions periodic domain ${\mathbb T}^3.$ The proof relies on a suitable semi-Galerkin scheme and the monotonicity method.</description>

      <title>On the variational dual formulation of the Nash system and an adaptive convex gradient-flow approach to nonlinear PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.</description>

Abstract: Conservation laws are computed for various nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in elasticity and acoustics. Using a scaling homogeneity approach, conservation laws are established for two models describing shear wave propagation in a circular cylinder and a cylindrical annulus. Next, using the multiplier method, conservation laws are derived for a parameterized system of constitutive equations in cylindrical coordinates involving a general expression for the Cauchy stress. Conservation laws for the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation and Westervelt-type equations in various coordinate systems are also presented.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sectorial operators in a Banach space $X$ of angles $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$, respectively, where $\omega_A+\omega_B&lt;\pi$. We present a simple and common approach to results on closedness of the operator sum $A+B$, based on Littlewood-Paley type norms and tools from several interpolation theories. This allows us to give short proofs for the well-known results due to Da~Prato-Grisvard and Kalton-Weis. We prove a new result in $\ell^q$-interpolation spaces and illustrate it with a maximal regularity result for abstract parabolic equations. Our approach also yields a new proof for the Dore-Venni result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the research on potential theory and its geometric applications from Euclidean spaces to homogeneous Carnot groups. We introduce a new approach to use the geometric completeness to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of polar sets of potentials of nonnegative Radon measures for sub-Laplacians in homogeneous Carnot groups. Our approach relies on inequalities that are analogous to the classic integral inequalities about Riesz potentials in Euclidean spaces. Our approach also uses extensions of some of geometric measure theory to homogeneous Carnot groups and the polar coordinates with horizontal radial curves constructed by Balogh and Tyson for polarizable Carnot groups. As consequences, we develop applications of potentials for sub-Laplacians in CR geometry, quaternionic CR geometry, and octonionic CR geometry.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>
