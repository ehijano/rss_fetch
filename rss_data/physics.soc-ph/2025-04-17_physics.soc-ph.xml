      <title>A phase transition in the Susceptible-Infected model on hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the master equations for the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model on general hypernetworks with~$N$-body interactions. We solve these equations exactly for infinite~$d$-regular hypernetworks, and obtain an explicit solution for the expected infection level as a function of time. The solution shows that the epidemic spreads out to the entire population as~$t \to \infty$ if and only if the initial infection level exceeds a positive threshold value. This phase transition is a high-order interactions effect, which is absent with pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>Superexponential growth of epidemics in networks with cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many dynamic processes on complex networks, from disease outbreaks to cascading failures, can rapidly accelerate once a critical threshold is exceeded, potentially leading to severe social and economic costs. Therefore, in order to develop effective mitigation strategies, it is essential to understand how these catastrophic events occur. In this work, we investigate the dynamic of disease propagation on networks with fully connected sub-graphs (or cliques) using a susceptible-infected-quarantined (SIQ) model, and considering a scenario where only a proportion $f$ of the population has access to testing. For this model, we derive the time-evolution equations governing the spread of epidemics and show that the final proportion of infected individuals undergoes a sudden transition at a critical threshold $f_c$. Moreover, close to this transition point, our results on the time evolution of the SIQ model reveal that the number of new cases can exhibit a faster-than-exponential growth. This accelerated spread dynamics is more likely to occur in networks with larger cliques.</description>

      <title>An effective method for profiling core-periphery structures in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Profiling core-periphery structures in networks has attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various methods. Among these, the rich-core method is distinguished for being entirely parameter-free and scalable to large networks. However, the cores it identifies are not always structurally cohesive, as they may lack high link density. Here, we propose an improved method building upon the rich-core framework. Instead of relying on node degree, our approach incorporates both the node's coreness $k$ and its centrality within the $k$-core. We apply the approach to twelve real-world networks, and find that the cores identified are generally denser compared to those derived from the rich-core method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural way for identifying an exceptionally dense core, i.e., a clique, which often approximates or even matches the maximum clique in many real-world networks. Furthermore, we extend the method to multiplex networks, and show its effectiveness in identifying dense multiplex cores across several well-studied datasets. Our study may offer valuable insights into exploring the meso-scale properties of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Socio-cognitive Networks between Researchers: Investigating Scientific Dualities with the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding why researchers cite certain works remains a key question in the study of scientific networks. Prior research has identified factors such as relevance, group cohesion, and source crediting. However, the interplay between cognitive and social dimensions in citation behavior - often conceptualized as a socio-cognitive network - is frequently overlooked, particularly regarding the intermediary steps that lead to a citation. Since a citation first requires a work to be published by a set of authors, we examine how the structure of coauthorship networks influences citation patterns. To investigate this relationship, we analyze the citation and collaboration behavior of Chilean astronomers from 2013 to 2015 using the Group-Oriented Relational Hyperevent Model, which allows us to study coauthorship and citation networks in a joint framework. Our findings suggest that when selecting which works to cite, authors favor recent research and maintain cognitive continuity across cited works. At the same time, we observe that coherent groups - closely connected coauthors - tend to be co-cited more frequently in subsequent publications, reinforcing the interdependence of collaboration and citation networks.</description>
