      <title>FLASH{\mu}: Fast Localizing And Sizing of Holographic Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D location and size of microparticles from diffraction images - holograms - is a computationally expensive inverse problem that has traditionally been solved using physics-based reconstruction methods. More recently, researchers have used machine learning methods to speed up the process. However, for small particles in large sample volumes the performance of these methods falls short of standard physics-based reconstruction methods. Here we designed a two-stage neural network architecture, FLASH$\mu$, to detect small particles (6-100$\mu$m) from holograms with large sample depths up to 20cm. Trained only on synthetic data with added physical noise, our method reliably detects particles of at least 9$\mu$m diameter in real holograms, comparable to the standard reconstruction-based approaches while operating on smaller crops, at quarter of the original resolution and providing roughly a 600-fold speedup. In addition to introducing a novel approach to a non-local object detection or signal demixing problem, our work could enable low-cost, real-time holographic imaging setups.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves significantly influences remote sensing, interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. This paper revisits the wave crest and action conservation laws and derives steady, nonlinear, analytical solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed 5/8 to wavenumber, 1/4 due to wave action, and 1/8 due to effective gravity. Examining the homogeneity and stationarity requirements for the conservation of wave action reveals that stationarity is a stronger requirement and is generally not satisfied for very steep long waves. We examine the results of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and not generally. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the nonlinear crest-action conservation solutions in long-wave steepness $\lesssim$ 0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the non-linearised crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>
