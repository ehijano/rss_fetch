      <title>Observation and Modeling of Small Spatial Structures of Solar Radio Noise Storms using the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most commonly observed solar radio sources in the metric and decametric wavelengths is the solar noise storm. These are generally associated with active regions and are believed to be powered by the plasma emission mechanism. Since plasma emission emits primarily at the fundamental and harmonic of the local plasma frequency, it is significantly affected by density inhomogeneities in the solar corona. The source can become significantly scatter-broadened due to the multi-path propagation caused by refraction from the density inhomogeneities. Past observational and theoretical estimates suggest some minimum observable source size in the solar corona. The details of this limit, however, depends on the modeling approach and details of the coronal turbulence model chosen. Hence pushing the minimum observable source size to smaller values can help constrain the plasma environment of the observed sources. In this work, we for the first time, use data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in the 250--500 MHz band, to determine multiple instances of very small-scale structures in the noise storms. We also find that these structures are stable over timescales of 15--30 minutes. By comparing the past observations of Type III radio bursts and noise storms, we hypothesize that the primary reason behind the detection of these small sources in noise storm is due to the local environment of the noise storm. We also build an illustrative model and propose some conditions under which the minimum observable source size predicted by theoretical models, can be lowered significantly.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of orphan penumbrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orphan penumbrae (OPU) are features resembling sunspot penumbrae, but are not connected to an umbra. Here we compare OPUs and sunspot penumbrae, including their filaments. We also identify and describe the main mechanisms for the formation of OPUs and we characterise their decay process. Our study is based on spectropolarimetric inversions of active regions observed with the Hinode spectropolarimeter. We manually identified 80 individual OPUs, allowing us to study them statistically. In addition, we analysed the time-evolution of selected OPUs using data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Orphan penumbrae display a broad range of shapes, associated with typically $\Omega$-shaped magnetic field configurations, where opposite polarity fields predominate at the two ends of the OPU. In addition, the properties of the OPU filaments are remarkably uniform between different OPUs, resembling the ones in sunspot penumbrae. Most OPUs form by either a patch of a penumbra separating from a sunspot, or by new magnetic flux emerging close to the polarity inversion line of an active region. We observe chromospheric fibrils above almost all OPUs in Hinode H$\alpha$ images, indicating that a part of the magnetic field of the OPUs extends to the chromosphere. Our results show that OPU filaments can form given a broad range of boundary conditions for the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Blue Lurker WOCS 14020: A Long-Period Post-Common-Envelope Binary in M67 Originating from a Merger in a Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a blue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67. We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of $0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$ and a cooling age of $\sim400$ Myr. This requires a WD progenitor of $\sim3$ M$_\odot$, significantly larger than the current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor star formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL. The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common envelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD binary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\odot$ Helium WD, making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>Evidence of .Ia Supernova Detonations in 3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Double Degenerate Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report detailed 3D simulations of 1.1 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) merging with a 0.35 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ helium WD, conducted with the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code AREPO. The simulations utilise self-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a stellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon burning. We find that a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer, starting a thermonuclear runaway which encircles the WD and ejects material as a sub-luminous supernovae. Our canonical simulation, (C-120), ejects 0.103 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of primarily $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$, after which the primary begins accreting again from the surviving secondary. Our results depend qualitatively on the "inspiral time" simulation parameter, which describes the length of a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. For example, the binary does not survive when inspiral time is too long. We compare the results using our self-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and find the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short. However, we are able to obtain a typical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) which destroys the primary by using the constant-composition structure and long inspiral. The shock-convergence in this simulation follows the "x-scissor mechanism" described by Gronow et al. in 2020, and causes a secondary detonation due to higher temperatures and higher number density of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the convergence site. These results highlight the potential for unrealistic outcomes when conducting simulations that incorporate unrealistically large enhancements in angular momentum losses and (or) non-realistic chemical structures for the primary WD.</description>

      <title>Dynamo Confinement of a Radiatively Spreading Solar Tachocline Revealed by Self-consistent Global Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helioseismically observed solar tachocline is a thin internal boundary layer of shear that separates the rigidly-rotating solar radiative zone from the differentially-rotating convective zone and is believed to play a central role in the 22-year solar dynamo cycle. The observed thinness of the tachocline has long been a mystery, given the expected tendency of such shear to undergo radiative spreading. Radiative spreading is the process by which the meridional circulation and angular velocity burrow into a stably-stratified fluid owing to the mitigating effect of radiative thermal diffusion. A confinement mechanism is thus required to keep the tachocline so thin. In previous work using global dynamo simulations, we achieved a statistically-stationary confined tachocline where the confinement mechanism was derived from the Maxwell stress arising from a dynamo-generated nonaxisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. However, the parameters chosen meant that the tachocline was confined against viscous spread instead of radiative spread. Here, we show that the previously identified dynamo confinement mechanism still succeeds in a simulation that lies in the more solar-like radiative spreading regime. In particular, a nonaxisymmetric, quasicyclic dynamo develops in the convective zone and overshoot layer, penetrates into the radiative zone via a novel type of skin effect, and creates a Maxwell stress that confines the tachocline over many magnetic cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully self-consistent rendering of a confined tachocline in a global numerical simulation in the parameter regime appropriate to the Sun.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Limits of Rotation Period Recovery through Gyrochronology Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods derived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel scales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and contaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending algorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability of rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share a common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we identify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components, helping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded Kepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\% success rate for periods $&lt;12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying this framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that despite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent gyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS blended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\sim8$ days are reliably recovered, while those longer than $\sim10$ days become significantly more challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are more often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to the brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases deviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results highlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that astrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for extracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of Four Candidates for Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators. No BLAPs at High Galactic Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained spectroscopic observations for four short-period variable objects detected in ZTF, Gaia, and Pan-STARRS (ZGP) data and classified as Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) in McWhirter and Lam (2022): ZGP-BLAP-03, ZGP-BLAP-04, ZGP-BLAP-10, and ZGP-BLAP-15. The variables have periods between 46 and 56 min, full amplitudes of 0.13-0.22 mag in the $r$ band, and light curve shapes typical for radially pulsating stars. Three of them were found at high galactic latitudes (|$b$|&gt;30 deg). We have identified object ZGP-BLAP-03 as an early F-type star, while objects ZGP-BLAP-04 and ZGP-BLAP-15 as low-metallicity late A-type stars. These are the three objects found at high galactic latitudes and located several kiloparsecs from the Sun. Thus, they are SX Phoenicis-type variable stars residing in the Galactic halo. In the case of low-latitude object ZGP-BLAP-10, we report the presence of helium lines in its spectrum and atmospheric parameters in agreement with known BLAPs. This and other results indicate that BLAPs are absent in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>

      <title>Plasma instability in the front of ejected energetic electrons and Type III solar radiobursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type III radio bursts are a signature of the flux of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It is traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the "time-of-flight" effect as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous, and gently varying solar-wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity-time profile of observed Type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration in Fermi-LAT behind-the-limb solar flares: the role of coronal shock waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the gamma-ray emission measured with Fermi-LAT and radio signatures of coronal shock waves in four behind-the-limb (BTL) solar flares. All events were associated with metric type II radio burst. Both start and end times of the radio bursts were synchronized with the gamma-ray emission. The type II bursts associated with the BTL gamma-ray flares had higher speeds and lower formation heights than those of an average sample. These findings support the notion that the highly relativistic ions that produce the gamma-rays in BTL flares are accelerated at CME-driven propagating coronal shock waves rather than in large-scale coronal loops.</description>

      <title>First images of Antares photosphere from spectropolarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antares is the closest red supergiant (RSG) to Earth. The discovery of linear polarization in the atomic lines of the star opens the path to produce direct images of the photosphere, hence probing the dynamics at the surface. We analyze this linear polarization signals following the same scheme as has been previously done for the RSG Betelgeuse, and find that they are comparable in all its details. This allows us to use the same models for the analysis of these polarization signals in both stars. We found that as in Betelgeuse, the linear polarization signal of Antares is due to the depolarization of the continuum combined with brightness inhomogeneities. This allows us to produce images of the photosphere of star. We show that in Antares, convective cells can last several months and occupy roughly 30\% of the stellar radius for the largest ones.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Understanding R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Metal-Poor Stars and Stellar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf: The Closest Supernova of the Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova 2023ixf occurred on May 18th 2023 in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 (D ~ 6.85 Mpc), making it the closest supernova in the last decade. Following its discovery, astronomers around the world rushed to observe the explosion across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to uncover its early-time properties. Based on multi-wavelength analysis during its first year post-explosion, supernova 2023ixf is a type II supernova that interacted with dense, confined circumstellar material in its local environment -- this material being lost from its red supergiant progenitor in the final years before explosion. In this article, we will review the findings of &gt;80 studies already published on this incredible event as well as explore how the synthesis of SN 2023ixf observations across the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to constrain both type II supernova explosion physics in addition to the the uncertain mass loss histories of red supergiant stars in their final years.</description>

      <title>Dissecting NGC 3132: Tracing the mass-loss history of the southern ring planetary nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to our understanding of stellar evolution and its impact on processes in our Galaxy and across the Universe is the study of mass loss. While the general framework is well established, recent JWST observations of objects like NGC 3132 have revealed intricate nebular structures, suggesting complex mass-loss processes likely driven by multiple star system at its core. These findings pose new challenges for the currently available investigation tools. The primary goal of this study is the first detailed comparison of the physical properties and chemical composition obtained for NGC 3132, based on the latest detailed 3D model and observations from MUSE, JWST and Spitzer. We evaluate the reliability of the traditional empirical method and photoionization model for abundances estimations, both based on the same available high-quality, spatially resolved observations. We find that the model and empirical method yield consistent results for the integrated total properties such as Te, ne and chemical abundances. However, when applied to simulated observations from the model, the empirical method fails to recover the model input abundances, providing only an approximate estimate. This discrepancy arises in part from the loss of information when summing fluxes over regions which have complex ionisation structures. This discrepancy in the case of oxygen has been estimated to be up to 35%. Moreover, the latest IR data reveal a spatial correlation between H2, c(Hb) as well as the [8.0]/[4.5] IRAC ratio. Finally, new clumps are discovered in [Ni II] 7378 \AA, [Fe II] 8617 \AA and [Fe III] 5270 \AA emission lines.</description>

      <title>Universal energy limits of radiation belts in planetary and brown dwarf magnetospheric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.</description>

      <title>JVLA Measurement of Grain Size in the Compact Dust Ring around Class I Protostar WL 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum grain size in protoplanetary disks is a critical parameter for planet formation, as the efficiency of mechanisms like streaming instability and pebble accretion depend on grain size. Even young class 0/I objects, such as HL Tau, show substructures in their disks, indicating the potential for early planet formation. In this study, we investigated the grain size in the dust surrounding the class I object WL 17 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Observations were conducted across seven frequency bands (Q, Ka, K, Ku, X, C, and S bands) ranging from 2 to 48 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 15 cm to 6.3 mm, with a spatial resolution exceeding 0\farcs5. While the ring structure at 0\farcs1 of WL 17 remains unresolved in our data, its emission is clearly detected at all observed frequencies, except at 2 GHz. To estimate the maximum grain size ($a_{\rm max}$) within the ring, we compared the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with theoretical SEDs calculated for various $a_{\rm max}$ values using radiative transfer models. Assuming the dust opacity follows the DSHARP model, our analysis suggests that certain structures internal to the ring achieved a maximum grain size of approximately 4.2 mm. Additionally, we discuss the gravitational stability of the ring and the potential planetary core mass that could form through pebble accretion within the structure.</description>

      <title>Ion-rich acceleration during an eruptive flux rope event in a multiple null-point configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the $\gamma$-ray emission above 100~MeV from the GOES M3.3 flare SOL2012-06-03. The hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave emissions have typical time profiles with a fast rise to a well-defined peak followed by a slower decay. The $&gt;$100~MeV emission during the prompt phase displayed a double-peaked temporal structure with the first peak following the HXR and microwaves, and the second one, about three times stronger, occurring $17 \pm 2$ seconds later. The time profiles seem to indicate two separate acceleration mechanisms at work, where the second $\gamma$-ray peak reveals a potentially pure or at least largely dominant ion acceleration. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly imaging shows a bright elliptical ribbon and a transient brightening in the north-western (NW) region. Nonlinear force-free extrapolations at the time of the impulsive peaks show closed field lines connecting the NW region to the south-eastern part of the ribbon and the magnetic topology revealed clusters of nulls. These observations suggest a spine-and-fan geometry, and based on these observations we interpret the second $\gamma$-ray peak as being due to the predominant acceleration of ions in a region with multiple null points. The $&gt;$100 MeV emission from this flare also exhibits a delayed phase with an exponential decay of roughly 350 seconds. We find that the delayed emission is consistent with ions being trapped in a closed flux tube with gradual escape via their loss cone to the chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of two directly imaged benchmark L dwarf companions at the stellar-substellar boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used multiple epochs of high-contrast imaging spectrophotometric observations to determine the atmospheric characteristics and thermal evolution of two previously detected benchmark L dwarf companions, HD 112863 B and HD 206505 B. We analyzed IRDIS and IFS data from VLT/SPHERE of each companion, both of which have dynamical masses near the stellar-substellar boundary. We compared each companion with empirical spectral standards, as well as constrained their physical properties through atmospheric model fits. From these analyses, we estimate that HD 112863 B is spectral type $\rm{L}3\pm1$ and that HD 206505 B is spectral type $\rm{L}2\pm1$. Using the BT-Settl atmospheric model grids, we find a bimodal solution for the atmospheric model fit of HD 112863 B, such that $T_{\rm{eff}}=1757^{+37}_{-36}$ K or $2002^{+23}_{-24}$ K and $\log{g}=4.973^{+0.057}_{-0.063}$ or $5.253^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$, while for HD 206505 B, $T_{\rm{eff}}=1754^{+13}_{-13}$ K and $\log{g}=4.919^{+0.031}_{-0.029}$. Comparing the bolometric luminosities of both companions with evolutionary models imply that both companions are likely above the hydrogen burning limit.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous GeV gamma-rays from molecular clouds illuminated by particles diffusing from the adjacent supernova remnant G335.2+0.1 that is confined in an expanding bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24{\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency analysis of the ALMA and VLA high resolution continuum observations of the substructured disc around CI Tau. Preference for sub-mm-sized low-porosity amorphous carbonaceous grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths &lt;3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (&lt; 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (&lt; 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars undergoing iron core-collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. Using these to predict CCSN outcomes over large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present explodability criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating stellar structure variables at the onset of core-collapse. The criteria are calibrated to predictions of a semi-analytical SN model, evaluated over a set of $\sim$~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99\% agreement with the semi-analytical model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups.
  Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN structure-based criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal by binary mass transfer. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse and formulate a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with observations of Type~IIP, IIb/Ib and Ic supernova progenitors and partially addresses the missing Red Supergiant Problem by direct black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 45 M dwarf stars (with 65 exoplanets) using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$&gt;=0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with planetary radii roughly up to 3 R$_{\oplus}$.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,\msun$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,\msun$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates have become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,\msun\,\yr^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,\myr$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,\msun$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs from gas with surface densities $\gtrsim10^3\,\msun\,\pc^{-2}$ and that nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are dominated by EMS-rich GCs that formed in the earliest phases of galaxy formation. These EMSs may have left behind intermediate-mass black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,\msun$) that could be found with ongoing gravitational wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>

Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>
