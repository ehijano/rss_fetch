      <title>Spatial verification of global precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verification of global high-resolution precipitation forecasts is challenging. Spatial verification techniques address some shortcomings of traditional verification. However most existing methods do not account for the non-planar geometry of a global domain, or their computational complexity is too large for global assessments. We present an adaptation of the recently developed Precipitation Attribution Distance (PAD) metric, designed for verifying precipitation, enabling its use on the Earth's spherical geometry. PAD estimates the magnitude of location errors in the forecasts employing the mathematical theory of Optimal Transport, as it provides a close upper bound for the Wasserstein distance. The method is fast and flexible with time complexity $O(n \log(n))$. Its behavior is analyzed using idealized cases and 7 years of operational global deterministic 6-hourly precipitation forecasts from the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The summary results for the whole period show how location errors in the IFS model grow steadily with increasing lead time for all analyzed regions. Moreover, by examining the time-series of the results, we can determine the trends in the score's value and identify the regions where there is a statistically significant improvement (or worsening) of the forecast performance. The results can also be analyzed separately for different intensities of precipitation. Overall, the PAD provides meaningful results for estimating location errors in global high-resolution precipitation forecasts at an affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic growth of sea ice: assessing the role of salinity using a quasi-static modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea ice is a mushy layer, a porous material whose properties depend on the relative proportions of solid and liquid. The growth of sea ice is governed by heat transfer through the ice together with appropriate boundary conditions at the interfaces with the atmosphere and ocean. The salinity of sea ice has a large effect on its thermal properties so might naively be expected to have a large effect on its growth rate. However, previous studies observed a low sensitivity throughout the winter growth season. The goal of this study is to identify the controlling physical mechanisms that explain this observation. We develop a simplified quasi-static framework by applying a similarity transformation to the underlying heat equation and neglecting the explicit time dependence. We find three key processes controlling the sensitivity of growth rate to salinity. First, the trade-off between thermal conductivity and (latent) heat capacity leads to low sensitivity to salinity even at moderately high salinity and brine volume fraction. Second, the feedback on the temperature profile reduces the sensitivity relative to models that assume a linear profile, such as zero-layer Semtner models. Third, thicker ice has the opposite sensitivity of growth rate to salinity compared to thinner ice, sensitivities that counteract each other as the ice grows. Beyond its use in diagnosing these sensitivities, we show that the quasi-static approach offers a valuable sea-ice model of intermediate complexity between zero-layer Semtner models and full partial-differential-equation-based models such as Maykut-Untersteiner/Bitz-Lipscomb and mushy-layer models.</description>

      <title>Shoaling of Finite-Amplitude Rogue Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>
