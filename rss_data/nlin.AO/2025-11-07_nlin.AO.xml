      <title>Complex dynamics and route to quasiperiodic synchronization in non-isochronous directed Stuart-Landau triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled Stuart-Landau equation serves as a fundamental model for exploring synchronization and emergent behavior in complex dynamical systems. However, understanding its dynamics from a comprehensive nonlinear perspective remains challenging due to the multifaceted influence of coupling topology, interaction strength, and oscillator frequency detuning. Despite extensive theoretical investigations over the decades, numerous aspects remain unexplored, particularly those that bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observations-an essential step toward deepening our understanding of real-world dynamical phenomena. This work investigates the complex dynamics of unidirectionally coupled non-isochronous Stuart-Landau oscillators. Calculations of steady-states and their stability analysis further reveal that periodic attractors corresponding to weak forcing or coupling regimes are dynamically unstable, which pushes the system towards quasiperiodic oscillation on the torus attractor. The mapping of parameter values with the kind of attractor of the oscillatory system is presented and classified into periodic, quasiperiodic, partially synchronized, and chaotic regions. The results of this study can be leveraged to design complex yet controllable dynamical architectures.</description>

      <title>Habitat fragmentation promotes spatial scale separation under resource competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitat fragmentation, often driven by human activities, alters ecological landscapes by disrupting connectivity and reshaping species interactions. In such fragmented environments, habitats can be modeled as networks, where individuals disperse across interconnected patches. We consider an intraspecific competition model, where individuals compete for space while dispersing according to a nonlinear random walk, capturing the heterogeneity of the network. The interplay between asymmetric competition, dispersal dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity leads to nonuniform species distribution: individuals with stronger competitive traits accumulate in central (hub) habitat patches, while those with weaker traits are displaced toward the periphery. We provide analytical insights into this mechanism, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating how competition and spatial structure jointly influence species segregation. In the large-network limit, this effect becomes extreme, with dominant individuals disappearing from peripheral patches and subordinate ones from central regions, establishing spatial segregation. This pattern may create favorable conditions for speciation, as physical separation can reinforce divergence within the population over time.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Single Parameter Scaling of Extinctions in Multispecies Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multispecies ecosystems modelled by generalized Lotka-Volterra equations exhibit stationary population abundances, where large number of species often coexist. Understanding the precise conditions under which this is at all feasible and what triggers species extinctions is a key, outstanding problem in theoretical ecology. Using standard methods of random matrix theory, I show that distributions of species abundances are Gaussian at equilibrium, in the weakly interacting regime. One consequence is that feasibility is generically broken before stability, for large enough number of species. I further derive an analytic expression for the probability that $n=0,1,2,...$ species go extinct and conjecture that a single-parameter scaling law governs species extinctions. These results are corroborated by numerical simulations in a wide range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale community organization governs epidemic onset and spread in metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how internal community structure shapes the course of epidemics remains a fundamental challenge in modeling real-world populations. Standard metapopulation models often assume uniform mixing within communities, overlooking how internal heterogeneity affects global outcomes. Here, we develop a general framework for epidemic spreading in hierarchically structured metapopulations, where individuals interact locally within dense communities and move across a broader network. We show that transmission dynamics are governed by the mesoscale organization of these communities: highly connected groups accelerate and amplify outbreaks, while less connected ones dampen spread. Through a combination of mean-field theory, spectral analysis, and stability methods, we reveal a direct link between internal connectivity and the emergence of uneven, spatially structured epidemic patterns. We further validate these predictions using real-world data, where social contact networks capture the local scale of transmission while spatial transport networks govern global connectivity, confirming the robustness of our framework across scales. These results demonstrate how community structure fundamentally governs the shape of epidemics in complex, networked populations, offering new insights into vulnerability, containment, and epidemic control.</description>
