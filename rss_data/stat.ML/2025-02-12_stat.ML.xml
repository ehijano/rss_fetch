      <title>Epistemic Uncertainty in Conformal Scores: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction methods create prediction bands with distribution-free guarantees but do not explicitly capture epistemic uncertainty, which can lead to overconfident predictions in data-sparse regions. Although recent conformal scores have been developed to address this limitation, they are typically designed for specific tasks, such as regression or quantile regression. Moreover, they rely on particular modeling choices for epistemic uncertainty, restricting their applicability. We introduce $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$, a model-agnostic approach that enhances any conformal score by explicitly integrating epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging Bayesian techniques such as Gaussian Processes, Monte Carlo Dropout, or Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$ adaptively expands predictive intervals in regions with limited data while maintaining compact intervals where data is abundant. As with any conformal method, it preserves finite-sample marginal coverage. Additionally, it also achieves asymptotic conditional coverage. Experiments demonstrate its good performance compared to existing methods. Designed for compatibility with any Bayesian model, but equipped with distribution-free guarantees, $\texttt{EPICSCORE}$ provides a general-purpose framework for uncertainty quantification in prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Confidence Intervals for Evaluation of Data Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data mining, when binary prediction rules are used to predict a binary outcome, many performance measures are used in a vast array of literature for the purposes of evaluation and comparison. Some examples include classification accuracy, precision, recall, F measures, and Jaccard index. Typically, these performance measures are only approximately estimated from a finite dataset, which may lead to findings that are not statistically significant. In order to properly quantify such statistical uncertainty, it is important to provide confidence intervals associated with these estimated performance measures. We consider statistical inference about general performance measures used in data mining, with both individual and joint confidence intervals. These confidence intervals are based on asymptotic normal approximations and can be computed fast, without needs to do bootstrap resampling. We study the finite sample coverage probabilities for these confidence intervals and also propose a `blurring correction' on the variance to improve the finite sample performance. This 'blurring correction' generalizes the plus-four method from binomial proportion to general performance measures used in data mining. Our framework allows multiple performance measures of multiple classification rules to be inferred simultaneously for comparisons.</description>

      <title>Generative Distribution Prediction: A Unified Approach to Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Online Covariance Matrix Estimation in Sketched Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the ubiquity of streaming data, online algorithms have been widely used for parameter estimation, with second-order methods particularly standing out for their efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we study an online sketched Newton method that leverages a randomized sketching technique to perform an approximate Newton step in each iteration, thereby eliminating the computational bottleneck of second-order methods. While existing studies have established the asymptotic normality of sketched Newton methods, a consistent estimator of the limiting covariance matrix remains an open problem. We propose a fully online covariance matrix estimator that is constructed entirely from the Newton iterates and requires no matrix factorization. Compared to covariance estimators for first-order online methods, our estimator for second-order methods is batch-free. We establish the consistency and convergence rate of our estimator, and coupled with asymptotic normality results, we can then perform online statistical inference for the model parameters based on sketched Newton methods. We also discuss the extension of our estimator to constrained problems, and demonstrate its superior performance on regression problems as well as benchmark problems in the CUTEst set.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Proximal Sampler for High-accuracy Sampling on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Riemannian Proximal Sampler, a method for sampling from densities defined on Riemannian manifolds. The performance of this sampler critically depends on two key oracles: the Manifold Brownian Increments (MBI) oracle and the Riemannian Heat-kernel (RHK) oracle. We establish high-accuracy sampling guarantees for the Riemannian Proximal Sampler, showing that generating samples with $\varepsilon$-accuracy requires $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations in Kullback-Leibler divergence assuming access to exact oracles and $O(\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations in the total variation metric assuming access to sufficiently accurate inexact oracles. Furthermore, we present practical implementations of these oracles by leveraging heat-kernel truncation and Varadhan's asymptotics. In the latter case, we interpret the Riemannian Proximal Sampler as a discretization of the entropy-regularized Riemannian Proximal Point Method on the associated Wasserstein space. We provide preliminary numerical results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</description>

      <title>Uniform Kernel Prober</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to identify useful features or representations of the input data based on training data that achieves low prediction error on test data across multiple prediction tasks is considered the key to multitask learning success. In practice, however, one faces the issue of the choice of prediction tasks and the availability of test data from the chosen tasks while comparing the relative performance of different features. In this work, we develop a class of pseudometrics called Uniform Kernel Prober (UKP) for comparing features or representations learned by different statistical models such as neural networks when the downstream prediction tasks involve kernel ridge regression. The proposed pseudometric, UKP, between any two representations, provides a uniform measure of prediction error on test data corresponding to a general class of kernel ridge regression tasks for a given choice of a kernel without access to test data. Additionally, desired invariances in representations can be successfully captured by UKP only through the choice of the kernel function and the pseudometric can be efficiently estimated from $n$ input data samples with $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ estimation error. We also experimentally demonstrate the ability of UKP to discriminate between different types of features or representations based on their generalization performance on downstream kernel ridge regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Bandit Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive progress in statistical Optimal Transport (OT) in recent years, there has been little interest in the study of the \emph{sequential learning} of OT. Surprisingly so, as this problem is both practically motivated and a challenging extension of existing settings such as linear bandits. This article considers (for the first time) the stochastic bandit problem of learning to solve generic Kantorovich and entropic OT problems from repeated interactions when the marginals are known but the cost is unknown. We provide $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret algorithms for both problems by extending linear bandits on Hilbert spaces. These results provide a reduction to infinite-dimensional linear bandits. To deal with the dimension, we provide a method to exploit the intrinsic regularity of the cost to learn, yielding corresponding regret bounds which interpolate between $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal O}(T)$.</description>

      <title>Quantification of model error for inverse problems in the Weak Neural Variational Inference framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel extension of the Weak Neural Variational Inference (WNVI) framework for probabilistic material property estimation that explicitly quantifies model errors in PDE-based inverse problems. Traditional approaches assume the correctness of all governing equations, including potentially unreliable constitutive laws, which can lead to biased estimates and misinterpretations. Our proposed framework addresses this limitation by distinguishing between reliable governing equations, such as conservation laws, and uncertain constitutive relationships. By treating all state variables as latent random variables, we enforce these equations through separate sets of residuals, leveraging a virtual likelihood approach with weighted residuals. This formulation not only identifies regions where constitutive laws break down but also improves robustness against model uncertainties without relying on a fully trustworthy forward model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of elastography, showing that it provides a structured, interpretable, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional model error correction techniques. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework enhances the accuracy and reliability of material property estimation by offering a principled way to incorporate uncertainty in constitutive modeling.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.
  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a "kernel-ignoring" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Generalization Error of Markov algorithms through Poissonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using continuous-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) proxies to stochastic optimization algorithms has proven fruitful for understanding their generalization abilities. A significant part of these approaches are based on the so-called ``entropy flows'', which greatly simplify the generalization analysis. Unfortunately, such well-structured entropy flows cannot be obtained for most discrete-time algorithms, and the existing SDE approaches remain limited to specific noise and algorithmic structures. We aim to alleviate this issue by introducing a generic framework for analyzing the generalization error of Markov algorithms through `Poissonization', a continuous-time approximation of discrete-time processes with formal approximation guarantees. Through this approach, we first develop a novel entropy flow, which directly leads to PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. We then draw novel links to modified versions of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (LSI), identify cases where such LSIs are satisfied, and obtain improved bounds. Beyond its generality, our framework allows exploiting specific properties of learning algorithms. In particular, we incorporate the noise structure of different algorithm types - namely, those with additional noise injections (noisy) and those without (non-noisy) - through various technical tools. This illustrates the capacity of our methods to achieve known (yet, Poissonized) and new generalization bounds.</description>

      <title>Guiding Time-Varying Generative Models with Natural Gradients on Exponential Family Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimising probabilistic models is a well-studied field in statistics. However, its connection with the training of generative models remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we show that the evolution of time-varying generative models can be projected onto an exponential family manifold, naturally creating a link between the parameters of a generative model and those of a probabilistic model. We then train the generative model by moving its projection on the manifold according to the natural gradient descent scheme. This approach also allows us to approximate the natural gradient of the KL divergence efficiently without relying on MCMC for intractable models. Furthermore, we propose particle versions of the algorithm, which feature closed-form update rules for any parametric model within the exponential family. Through toy and real-world experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Several scenarios require the optimization of non-convex black-box functions, that are noisy expensive to evaluate functions with unknown analytical expression, whose gradients are hence not accessible. For example, the hyper-parameter tuning problem of machine learning models. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods with state-of-the-art performance delivering a solution to this problem in real scenarios. It uses an iterative process that employs a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian process, of the objective function to be optimized computing a posterior predictive distribution of the black-box function. Based on the information given by this posterior predictive distribution, Bayesian optimization includes the computation of an acquisition function that represents, for every input space point, the utility of evaluating that point in the next iteraiton if the objective of the process is to retrieve a global extremum. This paper is a survey of the information theoretical acquisition functions, whose performance typically outperforms the rest of acquisition functions. The main concepts of the field of information theory are also described in detail to make the reader aware of why information theory acquisition functions deliver great results in Bayesian optimization and how can we approximate them when they are intractable. We also cover how information theory acquisition functions can be adapted to complex optimization scenarios such as the multi-objective, constrained, non-myopic, multi-fidelity, parallel and asynchronous settings and provide further lines of research.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>Global Ease of Living Index: a machine learning framework for longitudinal analysis of major economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The drastic changes in the global economy, geopolitical conditions, and disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the cost of living and quality of life. It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and comprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living conditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various socio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data and code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts. This transparency and accessibility make our work a valuable resource for ongoing research and policy development in quality-of-life assessment.</description>

      <title>Model Diffusion for Certifiable Few-shot Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern large-scale deep learning, a prevalent and effective workflow for solving low-data problems is adapting powerful pre-trained foundation models (FMs) to new tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, while empirically effective, the resulting solutions lack generalisation guarantees to certify their accuracy - which may be required for ethical or legal reasons prior to deployment in high-importance applications. In this paper we develop a novel transfer learning approach that is designed to facilitate non-vacuous learning theoretic generalisation guarantees for downstream tasks, even in the low-shot regime. Specifically, we first use upstream tasks to train a distribution over PEFT parameters. We then learn the downstream task by a sample-and-evaluate procedure -- sampling plausible PEFTs from the trained diffusion model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the downstream data. Crucially, this confines our model hypothesis to a finite set of PEFT samples. In contrast to learning in the typical continuous hypothesis spaces of neural network weights, this facilitates tighter risk certificates. We instantiate our bound and show non-trivial generalization guarantees compared to existing learning approaches which lead to vacuous bounds in the low-shot regime.</description>

      <title>Contextual Thompson Sampling via Generation of Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Thompson sampling contextual bandit algorithms, in which the algorithm's ability to quantify uncertainty and make decisions depends on the quality of a generative model that is learned offline. Instead of viewing uncertainty in the environment as arising from unobservable latent parameters, our algorithm treats uncertainty as stemming from missing, but potentially observable, future outcomes. If these future outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an "oracle" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing future outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of Thompson Sampling and prove a state-of-the-art regret bound for it. Notably, our regret bound i) depends on the probabilistic generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and ii) applies to any method of fitting the "oracle" policy, which easily allows one to adapt Thompson sampling to decision-making settings with fairness and/or resource constraints.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Supervised and Unsupervised Segmentation and Classification of Materials Microstructure Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructure of materials is often characterized through image analysis to understand processing-structure-properties linkages. We propose a largely automated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and, for multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous regions. With the advance of manufacturing and imaging techniques, the ultra-high resolution of imaging that reveals the complexity of microstructures and the rapidly increasing quantity of images (i.e., micrographs) enables and necessitates a more powerful and automated framework to extract materials characteristics and knowledge. The framework we propose can be used to gradually build a database of microstructure classes relevant to a particular process or group of materials, which can help in analyzing and discovering/identifying new materials. The framework has three steps: (1) segmentation of multiphase micrographs through a recently developed score-based method so that different microstructure homogeneous regions can be identified in an unsupervised manner; (2) {identification and classification of} homogeneous regions of micrographs through an uncertainty-aware supervised classification network trained using the segmented micrographs from Step $1$ with their identified labels verified via the built-in uncertainty quantification and minimal human inspection; (3) supervised segmentation (more powerful than the segmentation in Step $1$) of multiphase microstructures through a segmentation network trained with micrographs and the results from Steps $1$-$2$ using a form of data augmentation. This framework can iteratively characterize/segment new homogeneous or multiphase materials while expanding the database to enhance performance. The framework is demonstrated on various sets of materials and texture images.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Learning for k-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a $k$-SAT formula $\Phi$ where every variable appears at most $d$ times, and let $\sigma$ be a satisfying assignment of $\Phi$ sampled proportionally to $e^{\beta m(\sigma)}$ where $m(\sigma)$ is the number of variables set to true and $\beta$ is a real parameter. Given $\Phi$ and $\sigma$, can we learn the value of $\beta$ efficiently?
  This problem falls into a recent line of works about single-sample ("one-shot") learning of Markov random fields. The $k$-SAT setting we consider here was recently studied by Galanis, Kandiros, and Kalavasis (SODA'24) where they showed that single-sample learning is possible when roughly $d\leq 2^{k/6.45}$ and impossible when $d\geq (k+1) 2^{k-1}$. Crucially, for their impossibility results they used the existence of unsatisfiable instances which, aside from the gap in $d$, left open the question of whether the feasibility threshold for one-shot learning is dictated by the satisfiability threshold of $k$-SAT formulas of bounded degree.
  Our main contribution is to answer this question negatively. We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction. On the positive side, we simplify the analysis of the learning algorithm and obtain significantly stronger bounds on $d$ in terms of $\beta$. In particular, for the uniform case $\beta\rightarrow 0$ that has been studied extensively in the sampling literature, our analysis shows that learning is possible under the condition $d\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. This is nearly optimal (up to constant factors) in the sense that it is known that sampling a uniformly-distributed satisfying assignment is NP-hard for $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Building Social-Influence-Free Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Social Bayesian Optimization (SBO), a vote-efficient algorithm for consensus-building in collective decision-making. In contrast to single-agent scenarios, collective decision-making encompasses group dynamics that may distort agents' preference feedback, thereby impeding their capacity to achieve a social-influence-free consensus -- the most preferable decision based on the aggregated agent utilities. We demonstrate that under mild rationality axioms, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy feedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting system: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and more accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We model social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual voting system to efficiently learn this graph. Our theoretical findigns show that social graph estimation converges faster than the black-box estimation of agents' utilities, allowing us to reduce reliance on costly private votes early in the process. This enables efficient consensus-building primarily through noisy public votes, which are debiased based on the estimated social graph to infer social-influence-free feedback. We validate the efficacy of SBO across multiple real-world applications, including thermal comfort, team building, travel negotiation, and energy trading collaboration.</description>

      <title>Local Regularizers Are Not Transductive Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We partly resolve an open question raised by Asilis et al. (COLT 2024): whether the algorithmic template of local regularization -- an intriguing generalization of explicit regularization, a.k.a. structural risk minimization -- suffices to learn all learnable multiclass problems. Specifically, we provide a negative answer to this question in the transductive model of learning. We exhibit a multiclass classification problem which is learnable in both the transductive and PAC models, yet cannot be learned transductively by any local regularizer. The corresponding hypothesis class, and our proof, are based on principles from cryptographic secret sharing. We outline challenges in extending our negative result to the PAC model, leaving open the tantalizing possibility of a PAC/transductive separation with respect to local regularization.</description>

      <title>Exploring Neural Network Pruning with Screening Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual tasks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence data, and transformer models for rich linguistic or multimodal tasks, achieved unprecedented performance on a wide range of tasks. The impressive performance of modern DNNs is partially attributed to their sheer scale. The latest deep learning models have tens to hundreds of millions of parameters which makes the inference processes resource-intensive. The high computational complexity of these networks prevents their deployment on resource-limited devices such as mobile platforms, IoT devices, and edge computing systems because these devices require energy-efficient and real-time processing capabilities. This paper proposes and evaluates a network pruning framework that eliminates non-essential parameters based on a statistical analysis of network component significance across classification categories. The proposed method uses screening methods coupled with a weighted scheme to assess connection and channel contributions for unstructured and structured pruning which allows for the elimination of unnecessary network elements without significantly degrading model performance. Extensive experimental validation on real-world vision datasets for both fully connected neural networks (FNNs) and CNNs has shown that the proposed framework produces competitive lean networks compared to the original networks. Moreover, the proposed framework outperforms state-of-art network pruning methods in two out of three cases.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient RLHF Pipeline: A Unified View from Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While recent advancements have provided valuable insights into various stages and settings of RLHF, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the entire RLHF pipeline remains lacking. Towards this end, we propose a unified framework for the RLHF pipeline from the view of contextual bandits and provide provable efficiency guarantees. In particular, we decompose the RLHF process into two distinct stages: (post-)training and deployment, exploring both passive and active data collection strategies during the training phase. By employing the Bradley-Terry preference model with a linearly parameterized reward function, we reformulate RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem. We then develop novel algorithms for each stage, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our method to train and deploy Llama-3-8B-Instruct on the Ultrafeedback-binarized dataset, and empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Confidence Best Arm Identification with Decreasing Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the problem of best-arm identification in a stochastic multi-arm bandit with temporally decreasing variances for the arms' rewards. We model arm rewards as Gaussian random variables with fixed means and variances that decrease with time. The cost incurred by the learner is modeled as a weighted sum of the time needed by the learner to identify the best arm, and the number of samples of arms collected by the learner before termination. Under this cost function, there is an incentive for the learner to not sample arms in all rounds, especially in the initial rounds. On the other hand, not sampling increases the termination time of the learner, which also increases cost. This trade-off necessitates new sampling strategies. We propose two policies. The first policy has an initial wait period with no sampling followed by continuous sampling. The second policy samples periodically and uses a weighted average of the rewards observed to identify the best arm. We provide analytical guarantees on the performance of both policies and supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that our polices outperform the state-of-the-art policies for the classical best arm identification problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finetuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is crucial for generating results towards specific objectives. This research delves into the realm of drug optimization and introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to finetune a drug optimization LLM-based generative model, enhancing the original drug across target objectives, while retains the beneficial chemical properties of the original drug. This work is comprised of two primary components: (1) DrugImprover: A framework tailored for improving robustness and efficiency in drug optimization. It includes a LLM designed for drug optimization and a novel Structured Policy Optimization (SPO) algorithm, which is theoretically grounded. This algorithm offers a unique perspective for fine-tuning the LLM-based generative model by aligning the improvement of the generated molecule with the input molecule under desired objectives. (2) A dataset of 1 million compounds, each with OEDOCK docking scores on 5 human proteins associated with cancer cells and 24 binding sites from SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SPO and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the original drug across target properties. Our code and dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/DrugImproverGPT.</description>

      <title>Linear Transformers as VAR Models: Aligning Autoregressive Attention Mechanisms with Autoregressive Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive attention-based time series forecasting (TSF) has drawn increasing interest, with mechanisms like linear attention sometimes outperforming vanilla attention. However, deeper Transformer architectures frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow, multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model. Then, we propose Structural Aligned Mixture of VAR (SAMoVAR), a linear Transformer variant that integrates interpretable dynamic VAR weights for multivariate TSF. By aligning the Transformer architecture with autoregressive objectives, SAMoVAR delivers improved performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency, comparing to SOTA TSF models.</description>

Abstract: The performance of the Monte Carlo sampling methods relies on the crucial choice of a proposal density. The notion of optimality is fundamental to design suitable adaptive procedures of the proposal density within Monte Carlo schemes. This work is an exhaustive review around the concept of optimality in importance sampling. Several frameworks are described and analyzed, such as the marginal likelihood approximation for model selection, the use of multiple proposal densities, a sequence of tempered posteriors, and noisy scenarios including the applications to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and reinforcement learning, to name a few. Some theoretical and empirical comparisons are also provided.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</description>

      <title>5D Neural Surrogates for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Simulations of Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Overfitting Regimes of Nadaraya-Watson Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much interest in understanding the generalization behavior of interpolating predictors, which overfit on noisy training data. Whereas standard analyses are concerned with whether a method is consistent or not, recent observations have shown that even inconsistent predictors can generalize well. In this work, we revisit the classic interpolating Nadaraya-Watson (NW) estimator (also known as Shepard's method), and study its generalization capabilities through this modern viewpoint. In particular, by varying a single bandwidth-like hyperparameter, we prove the existence of multiple overfitting behaviors, ranging non-monotonically from catastrophic, through benign, to tempered. Our results highlight how even classical interpolating methods can exhibit intricate generalization behaviors. Numerical experiments complement our theory, demonstrating the same phenomena.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling with Bayesian Sample Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel generative model from the simple act of Gaussian posterior inference. Treating the generated sample as an unknown variable to infer lets us formulate the sampling process in the language of Bayesian probability. Our model uses a sequence of prediction and posterior update steps to narrow down the unknown sample from a broad initial belief. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish a connection between our model and diffusion models and show that it includes Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) as a special case. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over both BFNs and Variational Diffusion Models, achieving competitive likelihood scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Distributional Instrumental Variable Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instrumental variable (IV) approach is commonly used to infer causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Conventional IV models commonly make the additive noise assumption, which is hard to ensure in practice, but also typically lack flexibility if the causal effects are complex. Further, the vast majority of the existing methods aims to estimate the mean causal effects only, a few other methods focus on the quantile effects. This work aims for estimation of the entire interventional distribution. We propose a novel method called distributional instrumental variables (DIV), which leverages generative modelling in a nonlinear instrumental variable setting. We establish identifiability of the interventional distribution under general assumptions and demonstrate an `under-identified' case where DIV can identify the causal effects while two-step least squares fails to. Our empirical results show that the DIV method performs well for a broad range of simulated data, exhibiting advantages over existing IV approaches in terms of the identifiability and estimation error of the mean or quantile treatment effects. Furthermore, we apply DIV to an economic data set to examine the causal relation between institutional quality and economic development and our results that closely align with the original study. We also apply DIV to a single-cell data set, where we study the generalizability and stability in predicting gene expression under unseen interventions. The software implementations of DIV are available in R and Python.</description>

      <title>Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Causal Paths and Backdoor Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal additive models have been employed as tractable yet expressive frameworks for causal discovery involving hidden variables. State-of-the-art methodologies suggest that determining the causal relationship between a pair of variables is infeasible in the presence of an unobserved backdoor or an unobserved causal path. Contrary to this assumption, we theoretically show that resolving the causal direction is feasible in certain scenarios by incorporating two novel components into the theory. The first component introduces a novel characterization of regression sets within independence between regression residuals. The second component leverages conditional independence among the observed variables. We also provide a search algorithm that integrates these innovations and demonstrate its competitive performance against existing methods.</description>

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with Conformal Candidate Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is often ambiguous; for example, human annotation produces instances with multiple conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning (PLL) aims at training a classifier in this challenging setting, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels and one correct, but unknown, class label. A multitude of algorithms targeting this setting exists and, to enhance their prediction quality, several extensions that are applicable across a wide range of PLL methods have been introduced. While many of these extensions rely on heuristics, this article proposes a novel enhancing method that incrementally prunes candidate sets using conformal prediction. To work around the missing labeled validation set, which is typically required for conformal prediction, we propose a strategy that alternates between training a PLL classifier to label the validation set, leveraging these predicted class labels for calibration, and pruning candidate labels that are not part of the resulting conformal sets. In this sense, our method alternates between empirical risk minimization and candidate set pruning. We establish that our pruning method preserves the conformal validity with respect to the unknown ground truth. Our extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data show that the proposed approach significantly improves the test set accuracies of several state-of-the-art PLL classifiers.</description>

      <title>Cheap Permutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation tests are a popular choice for distinguishing distributions and testing independence, due to their exact, finite-sample control of false positives and their minimax optimality when paired with U-statistics. However, standard permutation tests are also expensive, requiring a test statistic to be computed hundreds or thousands of times to detect a separation between distributions. In this work, we offer a simple approach to accelerate testing: group your datapoints into bins and permute only those bins. For U and V-statistics, we prove that these cheap permutation tests have two remarkable properties. First, by storing appropriate sufficient statistics, a cheap test can be run in time comparable to evaluating a single test statistic. Second, cheap permutation power closely approximates standard permutation power. As a result, cheap tests inherit the exact false positive control and minimax optimality of standard permutation tests while running in a fraction of the time. We complement these findings with improved power guarantees for standard permutation testing and experiments demonstrating the benefits of cheap permutations over standard maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), random Fourier feature, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, cross-MMD, and cross-HSIC tests.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Non-Acyclic GFlowNets in Discrete Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of generative models that learn to sample objects from a given probability distribution, potentially known up to a normalizing constant. Instead of working in the object space, GFlowNets proceed by sampling trajectories in an appropriately constructed directed acyclic graph environment, greatly relying on the acyclicity of the graph. In our paper, we revisit the theory that relaxes the acyclicity assumption and present a simpler theoretical framework for non-acyclic GFlowNets in discrete environments. Moreover, we provide various novel theoretical insights related to training with fixed backward policies, the nature of flow functions, and connections between entropy-regularized RL and non-acyclic GFlowNets, which naturally generalize the respective concepts and theoretical results from the acyclic setting. In addition, we experimentally re-examine the concept of loss stability in non-acyclic GFlowNet training, as well as validate our own theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimension is an inherent bottleneck to some modern learning tasks, where optimization methods suffer from the size of the data. In this paper, we study non-isotropic distributions of data and develop tools that aim at reducing these dimensional costs by a dependency on an effective dimension rather than the ambient one. Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of ellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a chaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective dimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We show the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning problems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art results in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed optimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for non-smooth optimization. Both applications cover a class of functions that encompasses empirical risk minization (ERM) for linear models.</description>

Abstract: We establish disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalisation bounds for models trained with gradient descent methods or continuous gradient flows. Contrary to standard practice in the PAC-Bayesian setting, our result applies to optimisation algorithms that are deterministic, without requiring any de-randomisation step. Our bounds are fully computable, depending on the density of the initial distribution and the Hessian of the training objective over the trajectory. We show that our framework can be applied to a variety of iterative optimisation algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), momentum-based schemes, and damped Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>A duality framework for analyzing random feature and two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning functions within the $\mathcal{F}_{p,\pi}$ and Barron spaces, which play crucial roles in understanding random feature models (RFMs), two-layer neural networks, as well as kernel methods. Leveraging tools from information-based complexity (IBC), we establish a dual equivalence between approximation and estimation, and then apply it to study the learning of the preceding function spaces. The duality allows us to focus on the more tractable problem between approximation and estimation. To showcase the efficacy of our duality framework, we delve into two important but under-explored problems:
  1) Random feature learning beyond kernel regime: We derive sharp bounds for learning $\mathcal{F}_{p,\pi}$ using RFMs. Notably, the learning is efficient without the curse of dimensionality for $p&gt;1$. This underscores the extended applicability of RFMs beyond the traditional kernel regime, since $\mathcal{F}_{p,\pi}$ with $p&lt;2$ is strictly larger than the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) where $p=2$.
  2) The $L^\infty$ learning of RKHS: We establish sharp, spectrum-dependent characterizations for the convergence of $L^\infty$ learning error in both noiseless and noisy settings. Surprisingly, we show that popular kernel ridge regression can achieve near-optimal performance in $L^\infty$ learning, despite it primarily minimizing square loss.
  To establish the aforementioned duality, we introduce a type of IBC, termed $I$-complexity, to measure the size of a function class. Notably, $I$-complexity offers a tight characterization of learning in noiseless settings, yields lower bounds comparable to Le Cam's in noisy settings, and is versatile in deriving upper bounds. We believe that our duality framework holds potential for broad application in learning analysis across more scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning usually involves predictors in the overparameterised setting (number of trained parameters greater than dataset size), and their training yields not only good performance on training data, but also good generalisation capacity. This phenomenon challenges many theoretical results, and remains an open problem. To reach a better understanding, we provide novel generalisation bounds involving gradient terms. To do so, we combine the PAC-Bayes toolbox with Poincar\'e and Log-Sobolev inequalities, avoiding an explicit dependency on the dimension of the predictor space. Our results highlight the positive influence of flat minima (being minima with a neighbourhood nearly minimising the learning problem as well) on generalisation performance, involving directly the benefits of the optimisation phase.</description>

Abstract: We consider the penalized distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem with a closed, convex uncertainty set, a setting that encompasses learning using $f$-DRO and spectral/$L$-risk minimization. We present Drago, a stochastic primal-dual algorithm that combines cyclic and randomized components with a carefully regularized primal update to achieve dual variance reduction. Owing to its design, Drago enjoys a state-of-the-art linear convergence rate on strongly convex-strongly concave DRO problems with a fine-grained dependency on primal and dual condition numbers. Theoretical results are supported by numerical benchmarks on regression and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Estimation with Public Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of locally differentially private (LDP) learning with public features. We define semi-feature LDP, where some features are publicly available while the remaining ones, along with the label, require protection under local differential privacy. Under semi-feature LDP, we demonstrate that the mini-max convergence rate for non-parametric regression is significantly reduced compared to that of classical LDP. Then we propose HistOfTree, an estimator that fully leverages the information contained in both public and private features. Theoretically, HistOfTree reaches the mini-max optimal convergence rate. Empirically, HistOfTree achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real data. We also explore scenarios where users have the flexibility to select features for protection manually. In such cases, we propose an estimator and a data-driven parameter tuning strategy, leading to analogous theoretical and empirical results.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of Balance: From Information Projections to Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data balancing across multiple modalities and sources appears in various forms in foundation models in machine learning and AI, e.g. in CLIP and DINO. We show that data balancing across modalities and sources actually offers an unsuspected benefit: variance reduction. We present a non-asymptotic statistical bound that quantifies this variance reduction effect and relates it to the eigenvalue decay of Markov operators. Furthermore, we describe how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be better understood, and even improved upon, owing to our variance reduction viewpoint.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: self-supervised learning with Unknown Noise level and Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the noise distribution, and ii) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution. The first class of methods tends to be impractical, as the noise level is often unknown in real-world applications, and the second class is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Change Detection for Unnormalized Pre- and Post-Change Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting changes when only unnormalized pre- and post-change distributions are accessible. This situation happens in many scenarios in physics such as in ferromagnetism, crystallography, magneto-hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics, where the energy models are difficult to normalize.
  Our approach is based on the estimation of the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) statistics, which is known to produce optimal performance. We first present an intuitively appealing approximation method. Unfortunately, this produces a biased estimator of the CUSUM statistics and may cause performance degradation. We then propose the Log-Partition Approximation Cumulative Sum (LPA-CUSUM) algorithm based on thermodynamic integration (TI) in order to estimate the log-ratio of normalizing constants of pre- and post-change distributions. It is proved that this approach gives an unbiased estimate of the log-partition function and the CUSUM statistics, and leads to an asymptotically optimal performance. Moreover, we derive a relationship between the required sample size for thermodynamic integration and the desired detection delay performance, offering guidelines for practical parameter selection. Numerical studies are provided demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Completing multidimensional tensor-structured data with missing entries is a fundamental task for many real-world applications involving incomplete or corrupted datasets. For data with spatial or temporal side information, low-rank factorization models with smoothness constraints have demonstrated strong performance. Although effective at capturing global and long-range correlations, these models often struggle to capture short-scale, high-frequency variations in the data. To address this limitation, we propose the Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework for tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting additive structure enables effective characterization of both global dependencies and local variations. Specifically, we define the covariance norm to enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank factorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the local processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares (ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. GLSKF utilizes zero-padding and slicing operations based on projection matrices which preserve the Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating efficient computations through the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets across diverse tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that GLSKF achieves superior performance and scalability, establishing it as a novel solution for multidimensional tensor completion.</description>

      <title>Learning from Summarized Data: Gaussian Process Regression with Sample Quasi-Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a powerful Bayesian nonlinear regression method. Recent research has enabled the capture of many types of observations using non-Gaussian likelihoods. To deal with various tasks in spatial modeling, we benefit from this development. Difficulties still arise when we can only access summarized data consisting of representative features, summary statistics, and data point counts. Such situations frequently occur primarily due to concerns about confidentiality and management costs associated with spatial data. This study tackles learning and inference using only summarized data within the framework of Gaussian process regression. To address this challenge, we analyze the approximation errors in the marginal likelihood and posterior distribution that arise from utilizing representative features. We also introduce the concept of sample quasi-likelihood, which facilitates learning and inference using only summarized data. Non-Gaussian likelihoods satisfying certain assumptions can be captured by specifying a variance function that characterizes a sample quasi-likelihood function. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the approximation performance is influenced by the granularity of summarized data relative to the length scale of covariance functions. Experiments on a real-world dataset highlight the practicality of our method for spatial modeling.</description>

      <title>Natural Variational Annealing for Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new multimodal optimization approach called Natural Variational Annealing (NVA) that combines the strengths of three foundational concepts to simultaneously search for multiple global and local modes of black-box nonconvex objectives. First, it implements a simultaneous search by using variational posteriors, such as, mixtures of Gaussians. Second, it applies annealing to gradually trade off exploration for exploitation. Finally, it learns the variational search distribution using natural-gradient learning where updates resemble well-known and easy-to-implement algorithms. The three concepts come together in NVA giving rise to new algorithms and also allowing us to incorporate "fitness shaping", a core concept from evolutionary algorithms. We assess the quality of search on simulations and compare them to methods using gradient descent and evolution strategies. We also provide an application to a real-world inverse problem in planetary science.</description>

Abstract: Singular learning models with non-positive Fisher information matrices include neural networks, reduced-rank regression, Boltzmann machines, normal mixture models, and others. These models have been widely used in the development of learning machines. However, theoretical analysis is still in its early stages. In this paper, we examine learning coefficients, which indicate the general learning efficiency of deep linear learning models and three-layer neural network models with ReLU units. Finally, we extend the results to include the case of the Softmax function.</description>

      <title>Robust Amortized Bayesian Inference with Self-Consistency Losses on Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) can solve probabilistic inverse problems orders of magnitude faster than classical methods. However, neural ABI is not yet sufficiently robust for widespread and safe applicability. In particular, when performing inference on observations outside of the scope of the simulated data seen during training, for example, because of model misspecification, the posterior approximations are likely to become highly biased. Due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior estimators in the out-of-simulation regime, the resulting estimation biases cannot be fixed in acceptable time by just simulating more training data. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables training not only on (labeled) simulated data generated from the model, but also on unlabeled data originating from any source, including real-world data. To achieve the latter, we exploit Bayesian self-consistency properties that can be transformed into strictly proper losses without requiring knowledge of true parameter values, that is, without requiring data labels. The results of our initial experiments show remarkable improvements in the robustness of ABI on out-of-simulation data. Even if the observed data is far away from both labeled and unlabeled training data, inference remains highly accurate. If our findings also generalize to other scenarios and model classes, we believe that our new method represents a major breakthrough in neural ABI.</description>

      <title>Scalable and consistent embedding of probability measures into Hilbert spaces via measure quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on statistical learning from data that come as probability measures. In this setting, popular approaches consist in embedding such data into a Hilbert space with either Linearized Optimal Transport or Kernel Mean Embedding. However, the cost of computing such embeddings prohibits their direct use in large-scale settings. We study two methods based on measure quantization for approximating input probability measures with discrete measures of small-support size. The first one is based on optimal quantization of each input measure, while the second one relies on mean-measure quantization. We study the consistency of such approximations, and its implication for scalable embeddings of probability measures into a Hilbert space at a low computational cost. We finally illustrate our findings with various numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) problems are a cornerstone of many applications, but solving them is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose UNOT (Universal Neural Optimal Transport), a novel framework capable of accurately predicting (entropic) OT distances and plans between discrete measures of variable resolution for a given cost function. UNOT builds on Fourier Neural Operators, a universal class of neural networks that map between function spaces and that are discretization-invariant, which enables our network to process measures of varying sizes. The network is trained adversarially using a second, generating network and a self-supervised bootstrapping loss. We theoretically justify the use of FNOs, prove that our generator is universal, and that minimizing the bootstrapping loss provably minimizes the ground truth loss. Through extensive experiments, we show that our network not only accurately predicts optimal transport distances and plans across a wide range of datasets, but also captures the geometry of the Wasserstein space correctly. Furthermore, we show that our network can be used as a state-of-the-art initialization for the Sinkhorn algorithm, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Active Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ instance-dependent regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.</description>

      <title>DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</description>

      <title>Reparameterization invariance in approximate Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and constructing brain communications that capture dynamic communications across multiple regions is fundamental to modern system neuroscience, yet current methods struggle to find time-varying region-level communications or scale to large neural datasets with long recording durations. We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</description>

      <title>SKADA-Bench: Benchmarking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods with Realistic Validation On Diverse Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors.

      <title>Ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework for streamflow and flood prediction in Australian catchments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting extreme climate events; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge due to factors such as model calibration and missing data. We present an ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework that addresses large-scale streamflow forecasts using quantile regression for uncertainty projections in prediction. We evaluate selected univariate and multivariate deep learning models and catchment strategies. Furthermore, we implement a multistep time-series prediction model using the CAMELS dataset for selected catchments across Australia. The ensemble model employs a set of quantile deep learning models for streamflow determined by historical streamflow data. We utilise the streamflow prediction and obtain flood probability using flood frequency analysis and compare it with historical flooding events for selected catchments. Our results demonstrate notable efficacy and uncertainties in streamflow forecasts with varied catchment properties. Our flood probability estimates show good accuracy in capturing the historical floods from the selected catchments. This underscores the potential for our deep learning framework to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions and be implemented as an early warning system.</description>

      <title>Reranking Laws for Language Generation: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure large language models (LLMs) are used safely, one must reduce their propensity to hallucinate or to generate unacceptable answers. A simple and often used strategy is to first let the LLM generate multiple hypotheses and then employ a reranker to choose the best one. In this paper, we draw a parallel between this strategy and the use of redundancy to decrease the error rate in noisy communication channels. We conceptualize the generator as a sender transmitting multiple descriptions of a message through parallel noisy channels. The receiver decodes the message by ranking the (potentially corrupted) descriptions and selecting the one found to be most reliable. We provide conditions under which this protocol is asymptotically error-free (i.e., yields an acceptable answer almost surely) even in scenarios where the reranker is imperfect (governed by Mallows or Zipf-Mandelbrot models) and the channel distributions are statistically dependent. We use our framework to obtain reranking laws which we validate empirically on two real-world tasks using LLMs: text-to-code generation with DeepSeek-Coder 7B and machine translation of medical data with TowerInstruct 13B.</description>

      <title>The Causal Information Bottleneck and Optimal Causal Variable Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</description>

      <title>TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&amp;P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

      <title>The Plug-in Approach for Average-Reward and Discounted MDPs: Optimal Sample Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the plug-in approach for learning $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The plug-in approach constructs a model estimate then computes an average-reward optimal policy in the estimated model. Despite representing arguably the simplest algorithm for this problem, the plug-in approach has never been theoretically analyzed. Unlike the more well-studied discounted MDP reduction method, the plug-in approach requires no prior problem information or parameter tuning. Our results fill this gap and address the limitations of prior approaches, as we show that the plug-in approach is optimal in several well-studied settings without using prior knowledge. Specifically it achieves the optimal diameter- and mixing-based sample complexities of $\widetilde{O}\left(SA \frac{D}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(SA \frac{\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$, respectively, without knowledge of the diameter $D$ or uniform mixing time $\tau_{\mathrm{unif}}$. We also obtain span-based bounds for the plug-in approach, and complement them with algorithm-specific lower bounds suggesting that they are unimprovable. Our results require novel techniques for analyzing long-horizon problems which may be broadly useful and which also improve results for the discounted plug-in approach, removing effective-horizon-related sample size restrictions and obtaining the first optimal complexity bounds for the full range of sample sizes without reward perturbation.</description>

      <title>Limits to scalable evaluation at the frontier: LLM as Judge won't beat twice the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>{\mu}P$^2$: Effective Sharpness Aware Minimization Requires Layerwise Perturbation Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) enhances performance across various neural architectures and datasets. As models are continually scaled up to improve performance, a rigorous understanding of SAM's scaling behaviour is paramount. To this end, we study the infinite-width limit of neural networks trained with SAM, using the Tensor Programs framework. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of standard SAM effectively reduce to applying SAM solely in the last layer in wide neural networks, even with optimal hyperparameters. In contrast, we identify a stable parameterization with layerwise perturbation scaling, which we call $\textit{Maximal Update and Perturbation Parameterization}$ ($\mu$P$^2$), that ensures all layers are both feature learning and effectively perturbed in the limit. Through experiments with MLPs, ResNets and Vision Transformers, we empirically demonstrate that $\mu$P$^2$ achieves hyperparameter transfer of the joint optimum of learning rate and perturbation radius across model scales. Moreover, we provide an intuitive condition to derive $\mu$P$^2$ for other perturbation rules like Adaptive SAM and SAM-ON, also ensuring balanced perturbation effects across all layers.</description>

      <title>Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.
  We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</description>

      <title>Transformer Neural Processes - Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes. Originally developed as a scalable alternative to Gaussian Processes (GPs), which are limited by $O(n^3)$ runtime complexity, the most accurate modern NPs can often rival GPs but still suffer from an $O(n^2)$ bottleneck due to their attention mechanism. We introduce the Transformer Neural Process - Kernel Regression (TNP-KR), a scalable NP featuring: (1) a Kernel Regression Block (KRBlock), a simple, extensible, and parameter efficient transformer block with complexity $O(n_c^2 + n_c n_t)$, where $n_c$ and $n_t$ are the number of context and test points, respectively; (2) a kernel-based attention bias; and (3) two novel attention mechanisms: scan attention (SA), a memory-efficient scan-based attention that when paired with a kernel-based bias can make TNP-KR translation invariant, and deep kernel attention (DKA), a Performer-style attention that implicitly incoporates a distance bias and further reduces complexity to $O(n_c)$. These enhancements enable both TNP-KR variants to perform inference with 100K context points on over 1M test points in under a minute on a single 24GB GPU. On benchmarks spanning meta regression, Bayesian optimization, image completion, and epidemiology, TNP-KR with DKA outperforms its Performer counterpart on nearly every benchmark, while TNP-KR with SA achieves state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting biological concepts from microscopy foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful interpretability tool for large language models. By extracting known concepts (e.g., Golden-Gate Bridge) from human-interpretable data (e.g., text), sparse DL can elucidate a model's inner workings. In this work, we ask if DL can also be used to discover unknown concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data (e.g., cell images), ultimately enabling modern approaches to scientific discovery. As a first step, we use DL algorithms to study microscopy foundation models trained on multi-cell image data, where little prior knowledge exists regarding which high-level concepts should arise. We show that sparse dictionaries indeed extract biologically-meaningful concepts such as cell type and genetic perturbation type. We also propose Iterative Codebook Feature Learning~(ICFL) and combine it with a pre-processing step which uses PCA whitening from a control dataset. In our experiments, we demonstrate that both ICFL and PCA improve the selectivity of extracted features compared to TopK sparse autoencoders.</description>

      <title>A Particle Algorithm for Mean-Field Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals. In this paper, we introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for mean-field variational inference, which we term PArticle VI (PAVI). Notably, our algorithm does not rely on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals, and it applies to the nonparametric setting. We provide non-asymptotic finite-particle convergence guarantee for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Learning Sparse Superposed Features with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \textit{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or components of a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machine-trained models and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.</description>
