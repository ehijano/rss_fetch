      <title>Turbulence at Low Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence -- ubiquitous in nature and engineering alike [1-5] -- is traditionally viewed as an intrinsically inertial phenomenon, emerging only when the Reynolds number (Re), which quantifies the ratio of inertial to dissipative forces [6], far exceeds unity [7, 8]. Here, we demonstrate that strong energy flux between different length scales of motion -- a defining hallmark of turbulence [9] -- can persist even at Re ~ 1, thereby extending the known regime of turbulent flows beyond the classical high-Re paradigm. We show that scale-to-scale energy transfer can be recast as a mechanical process between turbulent stress and large-scale flow deformation. In quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) flows driven by electromagnetic forcing, we introduce directionally biased perturbations that enhance this interaction, amplifying the spectral energy flux by more than two orders of magnitude, even in the absence of dominant inertial forces. This study establishes a new regime of 2D Navier-Stokes (N-S) turbulence, challenging long-standing assumptions about the high Re conditions required for turbulent flows. Beyond revising classical belief, our results offer a generalizable strategy for engineering multiscale transport in flows that lack inertial dominance, such as those found in microfluidic [10, 11] and low-Re biological [12-15] systems.</description>

      <title>Global Buckley--Leverett for Multicomponent Flow in Fractured Media: Isothermal Equation-of-State Coupling and Dynamic Capillarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Intermittency in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equal-time scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence typically exhibit non anomalous scaling in the inverse cascade of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence and anomalous scaling in three dimensions. We demonstrate that multiscaling is not confined to longitudinal, scalar velocity increments, but also emerges in increments associated with the magnitude and orientation of the velocity vector. This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.</description>

      <title>High Reynolds number trends of centerline mean velocity and normal stress in pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CICLoPE facility at the University of Bologna in Forli, Italy, is a unique facility that provides fully developed pipe flow up to Reynolds numbers of about $Re_\tau$ of 50,000 with exceptional spatial resolution and stable operating conditions. Measurements obtained over the last two years, on the centerline of the pipe in the fully developed test section, with Pitot probes for the mean velocity in the stream ($\pm 0.2\%$ precision) and hot wires for the intensity of turbulence in the streamwise and the normal stress ( $\pm~5\%$ precision) are reported here and compared to other experimental results and some recent direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The comparisons reveal that high Reynolds number conditions are only reached when $Re_\tau$ is at least larger than $10,000$. The centerline von K\`arm\`an constant, $\kappa_{CL}$ for pipe flow is confirmed with high confidence to be $0.44$. Unlike previously reported measurements on the pipe centerline of the streamwise turbulence intensity and normal stress reported in the literature with various conflicting trends, both quantities are found in CICLoPE to reach a level trend beyond $Re_\tau$ around $25,000$ with values of approximately $2.9\%$ and $0.85$, respectively. Normalized streamwise velocity spectra on the centerline, with high resolution over seven decades of energy, exhibit a clear and extended $-5/3$ inertial range. Skewness and kurtosis of streamwise velocity are found to be independent of Reynolds number even down to $Re_\tau = 5,000$ and equal to $-0.5$ and $3.5$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evaporation Dynamics of Completely Pinned and Partially Pinned Sessile Droplets in Multi-Droplet Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of sessile droplets placed in close proximity is influenced by complex vapor-vapor interactions, producing a shielding effect that can significantly extend droplet lifetimes. This study presents a systematic experimental investigation of evaporation dynamics in multi-droplet configurations under ambient conditions, comparing completely pinned and partially pinned contact line modes. Completely pinned droplets are generated by introducing alumina nanoparticles, while partially pinned droplets consist of pure water. An isolated droplet is compared with arrays of two, three, and five droplets, each arranged at a fixed spacing ratio. High-speed shadowgraphy is used to measure droplet height, contact angle, volume, and lifetime. Results show that, although completely pinned droplets evaporate faster in absolute terms due to a constant contact radius, they experience a more pronounced relative lifetime increase from vapor shielding than partially pinned droplets. In five-droplet configurations, lifetimes increase by up to 89% and 124% compared to isolated droplets for partially pinned and completely pinned modes, respectively. A theoretical model incorporating evaporative cooling predicts central droplet lifetimes with good agreement. These findings underscore the coupled influence of contact line mobility and droplet proximity on evaporation rates.</description>

      <title>Freezing and ice aging dynamics in saline water under natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coupled dynamics of liquid-solid phase change and fluid flows is crucial in a wide range of geophysical and industrial applications. When freezing occurs in saline water, the newly formed ice is mushy, with a porous structure that traps the brine within the ice. In this work, which combines experiments and theoretical analyses, we investigate the long-term evolution of saline ice, comprehensively accounting for the coupled dynamics of multiscale fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and phase change. We show that in a closed convective system the rapid formation of a mushy ice layer is followed by desalination (i.e, the expulsion of salt from the ice) processes that might lead to a slow asymptotic decrease of the ice thickness. Desalination of mushy ice reduces its porosity, which alters the dynamic thermal equilibrium and ice thickness by weakening buoyancy-driven convection within the mushy layer. In turn, changes in brine convection and ice thickness affect the further desalination of the ice. The long-term dynamics of the system can be accurately predicted by a one-dimensional model based on appropriate parameterizations of global heat and mass transfer properties. Furthermore, within the same theoretical model we explore the ice dynamics across a broader parameter space. Our findings advance the understanding of the coupled phase-change physics of saline solutions in the presence of convective fluid flows and provide a basis for explaining and predicting real-world phenomena such as the aging of sea ice.</description>

      <title>Magnetic modulation of flow reversals in liquid metal thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow reversals are rarely observed in low-Prandtl-number liquid metal convection due to the fluid's exceptionally high thermal diffusivity. Here, we demonstrate that an external transverse magnetic field can induce such reversals in a quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) rectangular cell with an aspect ratio ($\it\Gamma$) of $0.2$. Our experimental observations reveal that the system initially exhibits periodic dynamics at the onset of reversals before transitioning to stochastic behavior as the ratio of Rayleigh number ($Ra$) to Hartmann number ($Ha$) increases. This transition is governed by the competition between buoyancy and Lorentz forces, with experimental data showing a linear scaling relationship between $Ra$ and $Ha$ at critical points. We develop a theoretical model that incorporates magnetic field effects in low-Prandtl-number convection to predict the reversal frequencies. These findings provide new insights into how magnetic fields can modulate flow regimes in low-Prandtl-number convection, establishing a controlled framework for investigating reversal dynamics in magnetohydrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature transformation recovering the compressible law of the wall for turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity and temperature distribution are both crucial for modeling compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. The compressible law of the wall for velocity has been extensively examined through velocity transformations. However, the issue of a well-established temperature transformation remains open. We propose a new temperature transformation for compressible turbulent channel flow. Our approach is based on the analysis of momentum and energy balance equations in the overlap layer. It accounts for the influences of mixing length model, the work of the body force, and the turbulent kinetic energy transport. Two types of temperature transformations are obtained: Van Driest type (VD-type) and semi-local type (SL-type). The performance of these transformations is evaluated using data from direct numerical simulations and wall-resolved large eddy simulations of compressible turbulent channel flow. Both the VD-type and SL-type transformations apply to isothermal and adiabatic walls. The SL-type transformation provides better data collapse in the viscous sublayer and buffer layer, thereby recovering the temperature law of the wall. When a suitable mixing length model is applied, the SL-type transformation yields results that agree with the incompressible temperature profile or exhibit extended logarithmic behavior. Results from the present study highlight careful consideration of the turbulent kinetic energy transport term in different thermal boundary conditions. Applications of the proposed transformation in near-wall modeling and its potential extension to more general configurations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravity current propagating against constant and pulsating counter flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the evolution of two-dimensional (2D) gravity currents that flow against a horizontally uniform laminar pulsating flow. We study the effect of opposing mean flow amplitude and the oscillatory velocity amplitude on the evolution of the gravity current, the emergence of instabilities due to shear at the interface of heavy and light fluid and unstable density stratification near the bottom wall, and the associated density redistributions. The velocity amplitudes and the oscillation frequency are reminiscent of tidal estuarine flows. This study revealed two key processes affecting the horizontal density transport of the heavy fluid, in addition to the buoyancy-driven propagation of the gravity current. The first process concerns the presence of shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) billows, depending on the strength of the opposing mean flow and the thickness of the gravity current. These KH billows are generated in the inertial phase of gravity current propagation and are responsible for coherent advective transport of heavy-fluid patches away from the gravity current head. The second process is related to the lifting of the gravity current head due to differential advection near the bottom wall when the propagation direction of the gravity current and the oscillating externally imposed flow are in the same direction. It generates a layer of light fluid below the heavy fluid of the gravity current head and becomes unstable when the ambient flow opposes the gravity current propagation, generating Rayleigh-Taylor-like (RT-like) instabilities. This results in a strong vertical redistribution of light and heavy fluid. Non-hydrostatic effects, such as the presence of KH billows and RT-like instabilities, with associated vertical density transport, have significant implications for large-scale horizontal density transport and modeling of salt intrusions in rivers and estuaries.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unsteady Aircraft Aerodynamics Using Lorenz Attractor: A Reduced-Order Approach for Wing Rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel modeling approach for unsteady aircraft airflow, leveraging the Lorenz attractor framework. The proposed model is based on the force distribution exerted by a lift-generating wing on the surrounding fluid. It distinguishes between turbulent and nominal components of the force distribution, with the nominal force distribution modeled to peak at the wing and decay linearly into the free stream. This separation allows the turbulent component to be represented by a transport equation that is influenced by flight conditions, specifically dynamic pressure and angle of attack. Consequently, the Navier-Stokes equations, along with the turbulence transport equation, can be transformed into a reduced-order model characterized by three scalar ordinary differential equations - similar to the Lorenz attractor. This resulting system effectively captures chaotic behavior, facilitating the exploration of complex dynamics without the computational demands of solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. A simulation trade study is conducted that models wing rock phenomena at high angles of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing the intricate dynamics of unsteady aircraft aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>Coupled Aerodynamic-Electromagnetic Modeling for RCS Estimation of Million-Scale Chaff Clouds with Arbitrarily Curved 3D Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the radar cross section (RCS) of chaff clouds requires careful consideration of aerodynamic effects, as the orientation and spatial distribution of individual chaff elements evolve significantly after deployment. Building upon conventional six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) formulations for chaff aerodynamic analysis-which assumed straight or two-dimensionally bent geometries-we extend the framework to incorporate arbitrarily curved three-dimensional chaff geometries. This extension enables accurate modeling of both flattened and helical dynamics induced by aerodynamic moments acting along the roll, pitch, and yaw directions, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic description of chaff motion. We then finally develop a coupled aerodynamic-electromagnetic framework that integrates the extended aerodynamic model with our recently developed fast method-of-moments solver, which is optimized for efficiently estimating the RCS of million-scale chaff clouds. The proposed multiphysics coupled framework allows real-time, first-principles prediction of the monostatic and bistatic RCS of large-scale chaff clouds with arbitrary geometries, orientations, and lengths, accurately incorporating their time-varying aerodynamic evolution. Simulation results confirm that the monostatic RCS is strongly influenced by aerodynamic effects, with the coexistence of flattened and helical motions playing a critical role in determining the overall scattering response. The proposed framework thus provides a physically grounded and computationally efficient approach for predicting the RCS of large-scale chaff clouds. Furthermore, it can be directly extended to radar signal processing applications by utilizing multi-frequency complex-valued far-field responses, thereby enabling the reconstruction of Range-Doppler, Range-Angle, and Doppler-Angle maps.</description>

      <title>Looking Inside the Widom Region: Non-Equilibrium Stratification in Supercritical CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supercritical state of matter is usually described as a continuous phase without sharp boundaries between liquid and gas regions. However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>AutoHood3D: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Automotive Hood Design and Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of the gradient expansion in linearised classical hydrodynamics</title>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically treat the ambiguities that generically arise in the gradient expansion of any hydrodynamic theory. While these ambiguities do not affect the physical content of the equations, they induce two types of transformations in the space of transport coefficients. The first type is known as the 'frame' transformations, and amounts to field redefinitions. The second type, which we introduce and formalise here, we term the 'on-shell' transformations. This identifies equivalence classes of hydrodynamic theories that provide an equally valid low-energy description of the underlying microscopic theory. We show that in any (classical) theory of hydrodynamics (at arbitrary order in derivatives), the action of such transformations on the dispersion relations and two-point correlation functions is universal. We explicitly construct invariants which can then be matched to a microscopic theory. Among them are, expectedly, the low-momentum expansions of the hydrodynamic modes. The (unphysical) gapped modes can, however, be added or removed at will. Finally, we show that such transformations assign a nilpotent Lie group to every hydrodynamic theory, and discuss the related algebraic properties underlying classical hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for simulating wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core principles of large-eddy simulations (LES). In particular, we employ the filtering function, interpreted as a spatial averaging operator, together with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to construct a closed numerical scheme suitable for computing solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. This framework numerically overcomes the difficulties associated with the non-locally integrable three-dimensional kernel inherent in the random vortex method, enabling efficient computation of flow fields via the Monte Carlo method. Several numerical experiments are presented for both laminar and turbulent flows in wall-bounded domains, to thereby reveal the underlying flow mechanisms near the wall boundary. The experimental results and systematic comparisons with alternative numerical approaches consistently demonstrate that the proposed method is numerically stable, possesses low theoretical complexity, and achieves acceptable computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles are common in biological and environmental flows and are widely used in industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Their motion and flow dynamics are strongly affected by interactions with the surrounding flow structure. While particle-flow interactions have been extensively studied in low Reynolds number (Re) flows as well as in fully developed turbulence, the transport mechanisms of these particles in intermediate flow regimes remain less explored. Here, we investigate the response of neutrally buoyant spherical particles to a single vortex flow field. Using a microfluidic cross-slot geometry, we generate a well-characterized, stationary, three-dimensional streamwise vortex at moderate $\text{Re}$ ($\sim 50$). Our experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, show that with increasing particle diameter, they are progressively excluded from the vortex core. Initially, small particles follow a Burgers vortex-like self-similar motion, but for larger particle diameters, deviations from this trend emerge due to fluid inertia and finite-size effects. These findings enhance our understanding of particle dynamics in vortical flows and have implications for microfluidic applications involving particle sorting and separation.</description>

      <title>Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows</title>

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in arbitrarily long gust sequences via pitch control. The random gusts produce intermittent, high-variance flows observed only through limited surface pressure sensors, making this control problem inherently challenging compared to stationary flows. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial observability from the limited surface pressures. We demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques -- pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord pitching.</description>

      <title>Mixing Fronts in Chaotic Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixing fronts develop at the interface of fluids with different solute concentrations leading to jointly evolving macroscopic and microscopic concentration gradients. Macroscopic gradients decay along the front through dispersion driven by microscopic velocity heterogeneity. The resulting macroscopic fluctuations are transmitted at the micro-scale through stretching and compression, where they are ultimately dissipated. While the elementary mechanisms leading to dispersion on the one hand and scalar mixing on the other hand are well understood, predicting how their coupling governs the evolution of concentration statistics within dispersing fronts remains a challenge. Here, we use theoretical derivations and numerical simulations of mixing fronts in chaotic flows to link the evolution of scalar variance to the microscale stirring and macroscale spreading properties of the flow. We argue that the transfer of energy between the macroscopic and microscopic scales operates at a characteristic length scale $s_i$, that we derive by comparing the characteristic times for scalar variance decay from dispersion and mixing. This leads to a closed expression for the concentration variance, which captures the results of numerical simulations with no fitting parameters for a broad range of Peclet numbers. For increasing stirring persistence, the numerical simulations deviate from the theory in the small Peclet range, which we explain qualitatively. These findings open a new avenue for predicting both conservative and reactive transport in mixing fronts, ranging from porous media flows to engineered flows in microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Large-scale streak instabilities of transitional channel flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale spatial modulations of turbulent channel flow, as the Reynolds number is decreased, is addressed numerically using the framework of linear stability analysis. Such modulations are known as the precursors of laminar-turbulent patterns found near the onset of relaminarisation. A synthetic two-dimensional base flow is constructed by adding finite-amplitude streaks to the turbulent mean flow. The streak mode is chosen as the leading resolvent mode from linear response theory. Besides, turbulent fluctuations can be taken into account or not by using a simple Cess eddy viscosity model. The linear stability of the base flow is considered by searching for unstable eigenmodes with wavelengths larger than the base flow streaks. As the streak amplitude is increased in the presence of the turbulent closure, the base flow loses its stability to a large-scale modulation below a critical Reynolds number value. The structure of the corresponding eigenmode, its critical Reynolds number, its critical angle and wavelengths are all fully consistent with the onset of turbulent modulations from the literature. The existence of a threshold value of the Reynolds number is directly related to the presence of an eddy viscosity, and is justified using an energy budget. The values of the critical streak amplitudes are discussed in relation with those relevant to turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Disk impact on a boiling liquid: Dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon the impact of a flat disk on a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid that is in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, a thin vapor layer is entrapped under the disk. Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure variation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are different from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more specifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the hydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact velocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient temperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge, and driven by the dynamic pressure $\rho_{\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at lower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial stage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This scenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the vapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the vaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates the condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The violent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous momentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be closely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high tilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk surface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket, which results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the central disk region does not occur.</description>

      <title>Sparse Narrow-Band Topology Optimization for Large-Scale Thermal-Fluid Applications</title>

Abstract: We propose a fluid-based topology optimization methodology for convective heat-transfer problems that can manage an extensive number of design variables, enabling the fine geometric features required for the next generation of heat-exchangers design. Building on the classical Borrvall-Petersson formulation for the Stokes flow, we introduce an optimization algorithm that focuses computational effort on the fluid-solid interface, where it is most needed. To address the high cost of repeated forward and adjoint analyses and to avoid leakage through nominally solid regions, we exclude fictitious solid voxels from the analysis by imposing the no-slip boundary conditions in the vicinity of the fluid-solid interface. In contrast to the prior approaches, the fictitious solids are also excluded from the global optimization problem via reducing it to a sequence of local narrow-band subproblems with a variable design space. The contribution of our method is that large-scale optimization can be solved efficiently by continuous simplex method while reliably obtaining binary designs without additional filtering or projection. We demonstrate efficiency of the method on multiple examples, including the optimization of a two-fluid heat exchanger at $Pe=10^4$ on a $370^3$ grid comprising $5\times10^7$ design variables using only a single desktop workstation.</description>

Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This behavior is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation, a priori learning, and a posteriori learning, where data-driven models enhance differential equations. The study underscores the critical role of post-processing and effective filtering of fine-resolution fields and the implications numerical methods selection, such as the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) or Finite Volume Method.</description>

      <title>Addressing bedload flux variability due to grain shape effects and experimental channel geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study-to-study variability of bedload flux measurements in turbulent sediment transport borders an order of magnitude, even for idealized laboratory conditions. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a universal method of bed shear stress determination. It consists of a physically-based definition of the bed surface and a channel sidewall correction that does not rely on empirical elements, except for well-established scaling coefficients associated with Kolmog\'orov's theory of turbulence. Application of this method to bedload transport of spherical grains -- to rule out grain shape effects -- collapses data from existing laboratory measurements and grain-resolved CFD-DEM simulations for various channel geometries onto a single curve. In contrast, classical sidewall corrections, as well as an alternative bed surface definition, are unable to universally capture these data, especially those from shallow or very narrow channel flows. We then apply our method to an extended grain-shape-controlled data compilation, complemented by literature data for non-spherical grains and from grain-unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. This compilation covers a very diverse range of transport conditions, ranging from very narrow to infinitely wide channels, from shallow to deep channel flows, from mild to steep bed slopes, and from weak to intense transport. We generalize an existing physical bedload flux model to account for grain shape variability and show that it explains almost all the compiled data within a factor of only $1.3$.</description>

Abstract: Considering turbulence is crucial to understanding clouds. However, covering all scales involved in the turbulent mixing of clouds with their environment is computationally challenging, urging the development of simpler models to represent some of the processes involved. By using full direct numerical simulations as a reference, this study compares several statistical approaches for representing small-scale turbulent mixing. All models use a comparable Lagrangian representation of cloud microphysics, and simulate the same cases of cloud-edge mixing, covering different ambient humidities and turbulence intensities. It is demonstrated that all statistical models represent the evolution of thermodynamics successfully, but not all models capture the changes in cloud microphysics (cloud droplet number concentration, droplet mean radius, and spectral width). Implications of these results for using the presented models as subgrid-scale schemes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for simulating acoustic (pressure) wave propagation across different media separated by a diffuse interface through the use of a weak compressibility formulation. Our method builds on our previous work on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system %\cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}% (Manzanero et al. (2020)), and incorporates a modified weak compressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase. We validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral convergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one dimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special attention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width of the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully captures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential convergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are accurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of $13^\circ$. In a final example, we show a three-dimensional wave transmission from air into water to demonstrate the potential of this methodology for addressing general multiphase acoustic problems. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic propagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications to marine aeroacoustics.</description>
