      <title>Searching for stellar-origin binary black holes in LISA Data Challenge 1b: Yorsh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the first search for stellar-origin binary black holes within the LISA Data Challenges (LDC). The search algorithm and the Yorsh LDC datasets, both previously described elsewhere, are only summarized briefly; the primary focus here is to present the results of applying the search to the challenge of data. The search employs a hierarchical approach, leveraging semi-coherent matching of template waveforms to the data using a variable number of segments, combined with a particle swarm algorithm for parameter space exploration. The computational pipeline is accelerated using GPU hardware. The results of two searches using different models of the LISA response are presented. The most effective search finds all five sources in the data challenge with injected signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 12$. Rapid parameter estimation is performed for these sources.</description>

      <title>Metric symmetry by design in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual derivation of Einstein's field equations from the Einstein--Hilbert action is performed by silently assuming the metric tensor's symmetric character. If this symmetry is not assumed, the result is a new theory, such as Einstein's attempted Unified Field Theory or Moffat's Nonsymmetric Gravitational Theory. Explicitly enforcing the constraint by means of a Lagrange-multiplier term restores Einstein's field equations, but the multiplier appears as an additional, unconstrained antisymmetric term. We briefly discuss the possible significance of this term with respect to a nonvanishing cosmological angular momentum, a sourced spin current, the nonsymmetric nature of the Einstein pseudotensor characterizing the energy-momentum of the gravitational field, and possible implications on attempts to obtain a quantum theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Spin effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals till the third post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary sources that emit gravitational waves (GW) are expected to be both spinning and have eccentric orbits. To date, there has been no closed-form expression for the phasing of GWs that contain information from both spin and eccentricity. The introduction of eccentricity can slow waveform generation, as obtaining closed-form expressions for the waveform phase is unattainable due to the complexity of the differential equations involved, often requiring slower numerical methods. However, closed-form expressions for the waveform phase can be obtained when eccentricity is treated as a small parameter, enabling quick waveform generation. In this paper, closed-form expressions for the GW phasing in the form of Taylor approximants up to the eighth power in initial eccentricity $(e_0)$ are obtained while also including aligned spins up to the third post-Newtonian order. The phasing is obtained in both time and frequency domains. The TaylorT2 phasing is also resummed for usage in scenarios where initial eccentricities are as high as 0.5. Finally, a waveform is constructed using the $e_{0}^2$ expanded TaylorF2 phasing for aligned-spin systems added to TaylorF2Ecc. We perform mismatch computation between this model and TaylorF2Ecc. The findings indicate that for eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.15$ (defined at 10 Hz) and small spins $(\sim 0.2 )$, the mismatches can be higher than 1%. This leads to an overall loss in signal-to-noise ratio and lower detection efficiency of GWs coming from eccentric spinning compact binary inspirals if the combined effects of eccentricity and aligned spins are neglected in the waveforms.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach for calculating shadow of dynamical black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real astrophysical black hole, surrounded by an accretion disc, experiences time-dependent mass variation due to accretion, impacting observable features like the shadow. In this work, we analyzed the dynamical shadow by extending the concept of the photon sphere to time-dependent spacetimes, incorporating induced, centrifugal, and relativistic forces. We demonstrated that the shadow grows when light loses energy and shrinks when it gains energy, with a surprising result that the shadow remains static when the photon sphere radius coincides with the NEC horizon radius. Our method, assuming a small accretion rate, provides a foundation for studying dynamical black holes, offering insights into processes like gravitational collapse, which could make shadow evolution detectable and reveal details about black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Template bank for sub solar mass compact binary mergers in the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched-filtering searches for gravitational-wave signals from compact binary mergers employ template banks which are a collection of modeled waveforms described by unique intrinsic parameters. We present two banks designed for low-latency and archive sub-solar mass (SSM) searches in data from the fourth observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, and demonstrate the efficacy of the banks via simulated signals. Further, we introduce a set of modifications to the geometric, manifold algorithm that allow the method to work for exceedingly low component masses necessary for SSM bank production. The archive search bank contains a total of $3,452,006$ templates, and covers a mass parameter space of $0.2$ to $10\ M_\odot$ in the larger component and $0.2$ to $1.0\ M_\odot$ in the smaller component, the spin parameter space of $-0.9$ to $0.9$ for masses above $0.5$ $M_\odot$ and $-0.1$ to $0.1$ for masses below $0.5$ $M_\odot$, and the mass ratio parameter space of $1$ to $10$. The PSD used was from a week of the first half of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA, and the low frequency cutoff was set to $45$ Hz with a maximum waveform duration of $128$ seconds. The bank simulations performed using SBank have shown that the banks presented in this paper have sufficient efficacy for use in their respective searches.</description>

      <title>Resumming Photon Loops for Inflationary Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous calculation of the 1-loop photon contribution to the graviton self-energy on de Sitter background is considered. We first show that there is no local obstacle to conservation, unlike the contribution from a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars. This is correlated to the absence of an Eddington ($R^2$) counterterm and to the vanishing of the stress tensor when the photon in integrated out in the presence of a constant graviton field. We also show that there is a secularly growing 1-loop contribution to the electric components of the Weyl tensor for plane wave gravitons. Its coefficient agrees with that of the secular 1-loop correction to the Newtonian potential, and both can be resummed using a variant of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of relativistic axionically active plasma in the field of dynamic aether. Part I: General formalism and new concept of equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an extended version of the kinetic theory of the relativistic axionically active multi-component plasma, which is based on the inclusion of a unit time-like vector field, associated with the velocity of dynamic aether, into the scheme of interactions. The proposed extension of the plasma theory can be indicated as semi-phenomenological. This term means that master equations for the gravitational, electromagnetic, pseudoscalar (axionic) and vector (aetheric) fields are derived using the Lagrange formalism, the kinetic equations for the distribution functions are obtained by the methods of the covariant statistics, however, the relativistic forces acting from the listed fields on the plasma particles are reconstructed phenomenologically based on classical analogies. We consider this work as a first part of a trilogy; here we presented, first, the complete formalism of this extended theory, second, the classification of forces, third, the new concept of equilibrium states in the relativistic axionically - aetherically active plasma.</description>

Here, we demonstrate that a similar correspondence exists for a broad class of traversable wormholes and verify it using several well-known examples.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic approximation of the semiclassical dissipation kernel in stochastic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical stochastic gravity is aimed at studying extended structure formation in the early universe. Rigorous developments in this area include the semiclassical noise and dissipation kernels which are obtained in terms of quantum stress energy tensor composed of scalar fields. The present article forms an important step in an effort to extend the theory in the decoherence limit and hydrodynamic approximation of the scalar fields. Such extensions will make it possible to analyse the extended structure formation around the decoherence era of the inflaton field in cosmology. On the other hand, modelling dissipation in fluids and effective fluids is a challenge and long standing mathematical physics related hurdles have posed difficulties for progress in this direction.The present article marks the beginning of a new way to model dissipation in an effective fluid using the widely accepted correspondence between the semiclassical fields and effective fluid approximation. A similar approach has been recently carried out for noise (fluctuations) kernel correspondence between the two, we now touch upon dissipation in the relativistic effective fluids.</description>

      <title>Analog model for Euclidean wormholes: Bose-Einstein condensate with dirty surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Bose-Einstein condensate under the effects of the non-condensate atomic cloud. We model the resulting linear interaction of the condensate with the atomic gas as a quenched disorder. Using the distributional zeta function method, we obtained a representation for the quenched free energy as a series of integral moments of the partition function. Assuming that the Bose-Einstein condensate is confined between two planar surfaces, we show that random surface fields generate non-local terms in the effective action. The non-local effects in this condensed matter system define an analog model for Euclidean wormhole.</description>

      <title>A scattering construction for nonlinear wave equations on Kerr--Anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of a large class of exponentially decaying solutions of the nonlinear massive wave equation $\Box_g\psi+\alpha\psi = \mathcal{F}(\psi,\partial\psi)$ on a Kerr--Anti-de Sitter exterior is established via a backwards scattering construction. Exponentially decaying data is prescribed on the future event horizon, and Dirichlet data on the timelike conformal boundary. The corresponding solutions exhibit the full functional degrees of freedom of the problem, but are exceptional in the sense that (even) general solutions of the forward, linear ($\mathcal{F}=0$) problem are known to decay at best inverse logarithmically. Our construction even applies outside of the \textit{Hawking-Reall bound} on the spacetime angular momentum, in which case, there exist exponentially growing mode solutions of the forward problem. As for the analogous construction in the asymptotically flat case, the assumed exponential decay of the scattering data on the event horizon is exploited to overcome the gravitational blueshift encountered in the backwards construction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a generalized modified Friedmann equation based on an entropy-area relation that incorporates established modifications, such as volumetric, linear, and logarithmic terms, in addition to novel entropic modifications that might yield to relevant cosmological implications at different stages of the evolution of the Universe. Some of these modifications are capable of mimicking the effects of dark energy and describing the current state of accelerated expansion of the Universe. We study particular cases of the generalized Friedmann equation and constrain the free parameters using observational datasets, including Hubble parameter measurements, baryon acoustic oscillations, and strong lensing systems. Our findings indicate that the proposed models align well with current observational data, particularly in low-redshift regimes; furthermore, these models are compatible with the value of $H_0$ obtained by the SH0ES program.</description>

It appears that the source terms with the particle number density in the creation law can be interpreted as the invisible part of the Universe.

      <title>Symmetric Teleparallel Connection and Spherical Solutions in Newer GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on symmetric teleparallel gravity, a modification of General Relativity where gravity is described by the non-metricity of an affine connection, whose curvature and torsion vanish. In these theories, the fundamental variables are the metric and an affine connection. Starting from the coincident gauge, a system of coordinates for which the affine connection coefficients vanish, we derive the most general connection for a spherically symmetric and stationary spacetime. We then derive the field equations in a specific class of symmetric teleparallel theories, the so-called Newer General Relativity. This theory is constructed from the five possible quadratic scalars of non-metricity. We find two families of vacuum solutions that correspond to some exotic objects and we study their properties. In particular, we investigate the possibility of having a traversable wormhole, we compute the Komar mass, we discuss the conditions for asymptotic flatness, the existence of singularities, the radial motion and bound orbits of particles around these objects, the light deflection as well as the causal structure of these spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>

      <title>Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise artefacts with optimised conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from regular black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a rotating regular black hole spacetime with an asymptotically Minkowski core, focusing on extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRIs) where a stellar-mass object inspirals a supermassive black hole under consideration. Such spacetimes are also called Kerr-like spacetimes, which motivate the investigation of black holes beyond general relativity and the test of the no-hair theorem. In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves (GWs) that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. In this scenario, as a result of the radiation reaction, we analytically compute the orbital evolution of the moving object. Further, we generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the effect of the additional non-Kerr/deviation parameter with the parameter as small as $\sim10^{-6}$. The constraint on the parameter in the regular black hole using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-5}$. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors, and further open up ways to put a stringent constraint on non-Kerr parameters with more advanced frameworks.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the mode equation for a quantized massless scalar field outside a black hole that forms from the collapse of a null shell: Late-time behaviors and computation of the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late-time behaviors of the modes in the Unruh state for various eternal two-dimensional black holes are discussed. The Unruh state is designed to be a state that mimics the late-time behaviors of quantized fields that Hawking predicted for the black holes that form from collapse. Evidence is provided that the late-time behaviors of some of the modes of the quantum fields and the symmetric two-point function are determined by infrared effects. In four dimensions, a spacetime is considered in which a black hole forms from the collapse of a spherically symmetric null shell. A method is developed to compute the semi-classical stress-energy tensor for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in the $in$ vacuum state outside the event horizon of the black hole. The computation of the stress-energy tensor involves finding the mode solutions of the scalar field and renormalizing the stress-energy tensor. The former has been done by expanding the modes of the scalar field in terms of a complete set of modes for an eternal Schwarzschild black hole. The latter is done by subtracting the stress-energy tensor for the scalar field in the Unruh state. The computation of the mode solutions of the scalar field in the $in$ vacuum state is discussed. The results are shown for three cases. They are the continuity of the modes for the scalar field across the null shell surface, their high-frequency behaviors for a fixed spacetime point, and their late-time behaviors for a fixed frequency and a fixed spatial point. The preliminary results for the contribution to the stress-energy tensor from the part of the scalar field modes that are ingoing inside the null shell are presented and an approximation for the contribution to the stress-energy tensor from the part of the modes that are outgoing inside the null shell is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a brane-world context in which our universe would be a four-dimensional brane embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime or bulk, wormhole geometries are induced on branes. In this article, the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the Molina-Neves wormhole are obtained on the brane using the Nakas-Kanti approach, which starts from a regular five-dimensional spacetime to obtain known black hole and wormhole solutions on the four-dimensional brane. From the bulk perspective, these wormholes are five-dimensional solutions supported by an exotic fluid, but from the brane perspective, such objects are wormholes not supported by any fields or particles that live on the four-dimensional spacetime. Thus, the cause of these wormholes is the bulk influence on the brane.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the theoretical framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB experiments. In particular, we clarify that what has been referred to as cosmic variance in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, when an optimal estimator is used, this variance can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements and will continue to diminish in future experiments. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation.</description>

      <title>Sachs equations and plane waves II: Isometries and conformal isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the symmetries of plane wave spacetimes in dimension four and greater. It begins with a description of the isometric automorphisms, and in particular the homogeneous plane waves. Then the article turns to describing isometries from one plane wave to another. The structure of the isometries is relevant for the problem of classifying vacuum spacetimes by observables, and the article presents an explicit example of a family of vacuum spacetimes encoding the Bernoulli shift, and so not classifiable by observables. Next, the article turns to a description of the conformal isometries. Here it is assumed that the conformal curvature does not vanish identically, the case of Minkowski space being both trivial and very degenerate. The article then classifies all conformal automorphisms and isometries of plane waves of the Rosen and Brinkmann forms.</description>

      <title>Is your stochastic signal really detectable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a challenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding \textit{bayesian sensitivity curve}. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free graviton theory given by linearising Einstein's theory has a dual formulation in terms of a dual graviton field. The dual graviton theory has two gauge invariances giving rise to two conserved charges, while the ADM charges of the graviton theory become magnetic charges for the dual graviton theory. These charges can be ill-defined in topologically non-trivial settings and we find improvement terms that can be added to these to give gauge-invariant conserved charges. These gauge-invariant charges, which have local expressions in both the graviton and dual graviton formulation, give topological operators of the theory that should be considered as the generators of the genuine symmetries of the theory.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume, that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be, unstable and quantify the decay using the life-time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales.We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA-I Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.1\%$ and $4.64\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.01 $ and $\Gamma = 0.074 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively.</description>

Abstract: A novel proposal is made to account for the dark matter component of the Universe. Ultralight dark matter with mass $\leq {\cal{O}}(10^{-22})~eV$ is one of the strong candidates for the missing mass which aids the formation of galaxies as well as holding them together. They are also known as fuzzy dark matter(FDM) which will come under Cold Dark matter. The question is what is this particle and its implications. How do we experimentally see it is an outstanding question. We propose to answer some of these questions with some evidences and the estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article examines the structure of plane wave spacetimes (of signature $(1,n+1)$, $n\ge 2$) that are homogeneous (the isometry group is transitive) and geodesically complete -- which we call microcosms. In general, a plane wave is shown to determine a smooth positive curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian associated with the $2n$ dimensional symplectic vector space of Jacobi fields. We show how to solve the Sachs equations in full generality for microcosms and, moreover, we relate the power series expansions canonical solutions to the Sachs equations on a general plane wave to Bernoulli-like recursions. It is shown that for microcosms, the curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian associated to a microcosm is an orbit of a one parameter group in $\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb R)$. We also give an effective method for determining the orbit. Finally, we specialize to the case of $n=2$, and give analytical formulae for the solutions to the Sachs equations and the associated one-parameter group orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. Although experiments and numerical simulations have solidly confirmed confinement, its physical origin remains mysterious today, and finding a theoretical explanation for it is a long-standing and challenging problem in physics and mathematics. Inspired by the recent progress in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we compute the Wilson loop correlators of the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory holographically in an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane background. The quantum gravity fluctuations of the near-horizon region are considered, which consequently affect the holographic Wilson loop correlators. Within this framework, the results suggest that the confinement of the super-Yang-Mills theory is induced by the near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations of the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of homogeneous but anisotropic cosmologies within the family of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, where the scalar field features an inhomogeneous profile but it preserves a translational symmetry that is realised as a combination of spatial translations and internal shifts. The spatial gradient of the scalar field introduces a preferred direction, so the resulting cosmologies are of the axisymmetric Bianchi I type. The momentum density of these configurations exhibits a universal evolution and an additional component with non-vanishing momentum density is required to have non-trivial effects. We show the relation of these scenarios with cosmologies of non-comoving components and, in particular, we explain how they provide a specific realisation of moving dark energy models. Among the class of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, we analyse in more detail the case of Kinetic Gravity Braiding with emphasis on its application to moving dark energy models and its effects on large scale dark flows as well as the CMB dipole and quadrupole.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$, which manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals in gravity: $\varepsilon$-factorized form for apparent singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry and contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. In contrast to previously studied Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals, the higher-order differential equation that this integral satisfies in dimensional regularization exhibits $\varepsilon$-dependent apparent singularities. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.</description>

      <title>There is more to the de Sitter horizon than just the area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the area of the de Sitter cosmological horizon is related to the entropy of the bulk spacetime. Recent work has however shown that the horizon encodes more information about the bulk spacetime than just the entropy. In this work, we show that the horizon contains all of the gauge invariant (diffeomorphism and $U(1)$) information about (static albeit unstable) configurations of charged and rotating objects placed deep inside the de Sitter spacetime. We study highly symmetric objects, such as dipoles and cubes, built of objects with electric charge and angular momentum at their vertices. We show how these configurations affect the geometry of the cosmological horizon and imprint detailed information about the objects in the bulk onto the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Spin effects in gravitational waveforms and fluxes for binaries on eccentric orbits to the third post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries can have non-negligible orbital eccentricities in the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, depending on their astrophysical formation channels. To accurately determine the parameters of such systems, waveform models need to incorporate eccentricity effects. In this paper, we consider an eccentric binary of spinning nonprecessing compact objects, and derive the energy and angular momentum fluxes at infinity, as well as the gravitational waveform modes to the third post-Newtonian order. The novel results of this paper include the next-to-leading order instantaneous spin-orbit and spin-spin contributions to the waveform modes, in addition to the hereditary (tail and memory) contributions to the modes and fluxes for eccentric orbits. The instantaneous contributions are derived for generic motion, while the hereditary contributions are computed in a small-eccentricity expansion, but we consider a resummation that makes them valid for large eccentricities. We employ a quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the motion using harmonic coordinates and the covariant spin-supplementary condition, which complements some results in the literature in other coordinates. Our results can be useful in improving the accuracy of waveform models for spinning binaries on eccentric orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the next-to-leading order corrections in the mass multipole expansion, i.e. the mass octupole and current quadrupole, to gravitational wave production by close hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. We find that the signal is again, as in the simple quadrupole case, a burst event with the majority of the released energy occurring during the closest approach. In particular, we investigate the relative contribution to the power, both in the time and frequency domains, and total energy emitted by each order in the mass multipole expansion in gravitational waves. To do so, we include in the quadrupole term its first order post-Newtonian correction, giving this a contribution to the power of the same order as that of the mass octupole and the current quadrupole. We find specific configurations of systems where these corrections could be important and should be taken into account when analysing burst events.</description>

      <title>Transient electromagnetic sources can detect solitary black holes in Milky Way galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to host up to a billion stellar-mass solitary black holes (BHs). The number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the existence of primordial BHs, and the interpretation of gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. {Sahu et al. recently confirmed one solitary stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing}. This work proposes a novel mechanism to identify such BH by analyzing the frequency and damping of the quasi-normal modes of GW generated from the interaction of the BH and EM wave originating from a transient electromagnetic (TEM) source. The incoming EM waves distort the curvature of a BH, releasing GWs as it returns to a steady state. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the generated GWs via the \emph{Regge-Wheeler tensor} and relate the GW amplitude to the energy of the TEM. We demonstrate that isolated BHs at a distance of 50 pc from Earth can be detected by LIGO A+ and 100 pc by Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope. Additionally, we discuss the observational implications for orphan afterglows associated with GRBs, highlighting the potential for further discoveries.</description>

      <title>Final States in Quantum Cosmology: Cosmic Acceleration as a Quantum Post-Selection Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability assignment for quantum cosmology. To this end, we derive effective classical equations of motion for systems subject to both initial and final conditions. Remarkably, these effective equations do not depend on the details of the quantum theory, but only on the geometric features of the classical state space. When applied to Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, these effective equations generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics. Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect, that is, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole formation has been discussed widely, when density perturbations in the early universe cause matter to collapse gravitationally, giving rise to these ultra-compact objects. We propose and point out that such a gravitational collapse would also give rise to primordial naked singularities, that would play an important role in the observable features of present universe. We consider two types of collapse scenarios that give rise to event-like and object-like visible singularities within a cosmological background. We briefly discuss implications of primordial naked singularities, including those for dark matter, vis-a-vis primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon chaos beyond Einstein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar\'e sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos. We find that with increasing energy, the particle trajectories explore regions closer to the black hole horizon, with reduced overlap between two initially close trajectories. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford bound [J. Maldacena et al., J. High Energy Phys. 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of Torsion on Neutron Star Structure in Einstein-Cartan Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein-Cartan gravity is a close historical sibling of general relativity that allows for spacetime torsion. As a result, angular momentum couples to spacetime geometry in a similar way to energy. While consequences of this are well studied on cosmological scales, their role in neutron star physics is largely under-explored. We study the effects that torsion, sourced by either microphysical spin or macroscopic angular momentum, has on neutron stars. For this, we use a simplified polytropic model to quantify the microphysical coupling to torsion. We also derive expressions to model rotation-induced torsion effects and estimate the consequences for rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates. We find that the presence of torsion in general leads to neutron stars with smaller radii and masses, but higher central densities. Realistic models for microphysical spin lead to torsion effects that have no relevant influence on the neutron star structure. Rotation-induced torsion effects however, can decrease the radius by up to $900\,m$, which is comparable to the increase due to centrifugal forces. Depending on which effect dominates, this leads to a torsion-induced spin-up or spin-down of the neutron star. We conclude that torsion effects due to rotation can not be neglected and are large enough to be tested using current or near-future technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the power spectrum $P_n$ of the $n$th harmonic for Garfinkle-Vachaspati cosmic strings, which correspond to planar rectangular loops. While these loop tractories are self-intersecting, a slightly perturbed non-self-intersecting form of these trajectories has been suggested as a generic end state of cosmic string loop fragmentation. We find that $P_n$ scales as $n^{-2} \ln n$, rather than the expected $n^{-2}$ for kink-kink collisions. This result is demonstrated analytically for even $n$ in square loops and numerically for all other cases. At lowest order, the effect of loop decays is to further enhance $P_n$ at large $n$ relative to its value at small $n$. The consequences for relic stochastic background radiation along with the caveats pertaining to our results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's General Relativity with a conformally coupled scalar field in arbitrary dimensions. Using a four rank tensor introduced earlier we recast the field equations in a manifestly symmetric form to elucidate a somewhat less-known feature of dual mapping between solutions. We also show that there is a two-parameter subfamily of solutions which enjoy a duality symmetry and in four dimensions both the BBMB black hole and the Barcelo-Visser wormhole belong to this subfamily. Along the way, we rederive the full three-parameter family of solutions by direct integration of the field equations and a natural choice of ansatz which arguably has several advantages over other previously known methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory is characterized by a signal component that persists after a transient signal has decayed. Treating such signals in the frequency domain is non-trivial, since discrete Fourier transforms assume periodic signals on finite time intervals. In order to reduce artifacts in the Fourier transform, it is common to use recipes that involve windowing and padding with constant values. Here we discuss how to regularize the Fourier transform in a straightforward way by splitting the signal into a given sigmoid function that can be Fourier transformed in closed form, and a residual which does depend on the details of the gravitational-wave signal and has to be Fourier transformed numerically, but does not contain a persistent component. We provide a detailed discussion of how to map between continuous and discrete Fourier transforms of signals that contain a persistent component. We apply this approach to discuss the frequency-domain phenomenology of the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode, which contains both a memory and an oscillatory ringdown component.</description>

      <title>The Memory of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves, after they enter the horizon and decay away, leave a residual displacement in test particles: a memory, in analogy with gravitational waves generated by astrophysical sources. The late-time distance between test particles is related to the one at early times by $\xi^i_{\rm late} = \frac{a_{\rm late}}{a_{\rm early}} (\delta^i_j -\frac12 \bar h^i_j)\xi^j_{\rm early}$. Therefore, the deformation of an initial spherical shell does not depend on the cosmological evolution, but only on the primordial value $\bar h^i_{j}$ of the gravitational wave. The memory is thus related to the adiabatic tensor mode that maps the unperturbed FLRW geometries at early and late times; this is analogous to the relation between memory in Minkowski spacetime and the BMS group. The primordial memory is also connected to the consistency relations of cosmological correlators, as the flat-space memory is related to the soft theorems for gravitational wave emission. We comment on the signature of the effect on the CMB $B$-modes and on the large-scale structure. There is also a primordial memory effect that is subleading in the spatial gradients of the wave: it is encoded in the rotation of free-falling gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Fluctuations and Brownian Motion Detection of Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The Bose-Einstein occupation number $N_g$ for gravitons can be large enough to be the particle components of the gravitational random fluctuations in a physical system. The stochastic gravitational noise produced by the gravitons displaces a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations of a large number of gravitons, causing a Brownian motion displacement $\Delta x$ of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the black hole shadow of an exact black hole solution of the loop quantum gravity (LQG) theory. We discuss some of its optical characteristics after generalizing it to the rotational case, including null geodesics and black hole shadow. From these we can compare the impact of different theories on the most deeply understood characteristics of the black hole and get a new way to test the accuracy of the modified gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a class of Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity was proposed, allowing black holes to carry ghost-free massive scalar hair for the first time without requiring additional matter fields. This intriguing feature offers a new perspective for understanding higher-curvature pure gravity and highlights the importance of further studying the potential effects of Gauss-Bonnet extensions in gravitational systems beyond black holes. In this study, we investigate the properties of neutron stars within this model, focusing on how the higher-curvature terms, particularly the coupling between the Gauss-Bonnet term and the curvature-squared term, impact the stellar structure. We present a detailed analysis of these effects and compute the moment of inertia for rotating neutron stars under the slow-rotation approximation. The substantial differences in the moment of inertia between general relativity and Gauss-Bonnet extended Starobinsky gravity are expected to be detectable through future high-precision observations.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>QCD coupling constant ($\alpha_c$) and nonzero value of strange quark mass ($m_s\neq 0$) dependent stable stellar structure admitting observational results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discuses the effect of the QCD coupling constant ($\alpha_c$) on various physical properties of compact stars in the framework of the Tolman IV potential admitting the equation of state of MIT bag model with nonzero value of mass of strange quark mass ($m_s$). The internal matter, consisting of the deconfined phase of the $3$-flavour quark, is overall charge neutral due to the presence of electrons and is assumed to be strongly interacting. Interestingly, it is noted that the coupling constant $\alpha_c$ has an upper limit due to thermodynamic consistency and affects the stability of the stellar structure in terms of energy per baryon ($E_B$). Present model is suitable to study the properties of stars with mass of approximately $\leq 2.00~M_{\odot}$. The predicted radii of a few known stars from our model are in good agreement with the estimated values of radius obtained from the observations. Necessary energy conditions are obeyed inside the stellar configuration. Various stability conditions are carried out and it is found that within the range of parameter space used here the model is stable.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravity and Quantum Physics: Primordial Black Holes and the Evolution of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light, specifically in the form of the experimentally discovered photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantum attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, and the very early formation of galaxies and large-scale structures, established by JWST data. The model also investigates quantized characteristics of PBHs, such as mass, entropy, and temperature, suggesting that quantum processes are fundamental to black hole mechanics. By addressing issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter, and dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and proposes that PBHs may serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that understanding PBH physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical paradoxes for the ultimate unification of quantum mechanics with gravity.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Gravitational Wave Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust, unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in physics.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of spherically symmetric astrophysical objects in f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static spherically symmetric (SSS) gravitational configurations in f(R) gravity are studied in case of a sufficiently large scalaron mass $\mu$. The primary focus is on vacuum SSS solutions describing asymptotically flat systems. In different f(R) models $\mu$ varies from several meV to $\sim 10^{13}$Gev yielding very large dimensionless (in Planck units) parameter $M\mu$ for a typical astrophysical mass $M$. We identify a class of scalaron potentials in the Einstein frame of f(R) gravity that encompasses several well-known models and permits a straightforward analytical description of SSS objects for $M\mu\gg 1$. The approximate solutions describe well the SSS configurations in regions of both strong and weak scalaron fields and demonstrate remarkably similar properties across the considered class of scalaron potentials for astrophysically significant cases. The results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we fist consider the shadow radius of a quantum corrected black hole proposed recently, and provide a bound on the correction parameter based on the observational data of Sgr A*. Then, the effects of the correction parameter on the energy, angular momenta and angular velocities of particles on circular orbits in the accretion disk are discussed. It is found that the correction parameter has significant effects on the angular momenta of particles on the circular orbits even in the far region from the black hole. It would be possible to identify the value of the correction parameter by the observations of the angular momenta of particles in the disk. It is also found that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the increase of the correction parameter, while the radiative efficiency of the black hole decreases with the increase of the correction parameter. Finally, we consider how the correction parameter affect the emitted and observed radiation fluxes from a thin accretion disk around the black hole. Polynomial fitting functions are identified for the relations between the maxima of three typical radiation fluxes and the correction parameter.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16658v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled 2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory. Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and "Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time. We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN jet precession with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession. Studies such as ours will help to reveal the cosmic population of precessing jets that are detectable with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Idealization Paradox</title>

Abstract: Stephen Hawking's derivation of Hawking radiation relied on one particular spacetime model, that of a star collapsing into a black hole which then remains in existence forever. He then argued that Hawking radiation implies this model should be thrown away in favour of a different model, that of an evaporating black hole. This aspect of Hawking's argument is an example of an idealization that is pervasive in the literature on black hole thermodynamics, but which has not yet been widely discussed by philosophers. The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of Hawking's idealization, and to show a sense in which it leads to a paradox. After identifying this idealization paradox in classic derivations of Hawking radiation, I go on to show how various research programmes in black hole thermodynamics can be viewed as possible resolutions to the paradox. I give an initial analysis of the prospects for success of these various resolutions, and show how they shed light on both the philosophical foundations of both Hawking radiation on the nature of idealizations in physics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that quantizing gravity on a null hypersurface leads to the emergence of a CFT associated with each null ray. This result stems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a canonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint generating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central charge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in gravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis reveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each null ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a crucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its dynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore, we show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due to the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there is a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of `embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental building blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole isocurvature: the effect of non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_{\rm PBH}&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ can dominate transiently the energy budget of the Universe and reheat the Universe through their evaporation taking place before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The isocurvature energy density fluctuations associated to the inhomogeneous distribution of a population of such PBHs can induce an abundant production of GWs due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we discuss the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering properties of PBHs and study the effect of a clustered PBH population on the spectral shape of the aforementioned induced GW signal. In particular, focusing on local-type non-Gaussianity we find a double-peaked GW signal with the amplitude of the low-frequency peak being proportional to the square of the non-Gaussian parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NL}$. Remarkably, depending on the PBH mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ and the initial abundance of PBHs at formation time, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, this double-peaked GW signal can lie well within the frequency bands of forthcoming GW detectors, namely LISA, ET, SKA and BBO, hence rendering this signal falsifiable by GW experiments and promoting it as a novel portal probing the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Minimum gas mass accreted by spinning intermediate-mass black holes in stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) growing through repeated black hole mergers in stellar clusters statistically asymptotes to zero. Putative observations of IMBHs with dimensionless spin parameter $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$ would require a phase of coherent gas accretion to spin up the black hole. We estimate the amount of gas necessary to produce a given IMBH spin. If the observed IMBH mass and spin are $M\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ and $\chi\gtrsim 0.6$, respectively, the IMBH must have coherently accreted at least $\sim 100~M_\odot$ of gas. In this scenario, as long as the spin is not maximal, the IMBH can only accrete at most half of its mass. Our estimates can constrain the relative contribution of accretion and mergers to the growth of IMBHs in dense stellar environments.</description>

      <title>Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. Given uncertainties in microphysics, we have not determined the crust configuration after this failure. Instead, we argue that the crust may fail in an asymmetric way and could produce a configuration with a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). If the ellipticity is large, a rotating star will radiate gravitational waves that may limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that can naturally be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topological quantized current in the incommensurate regimes.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>
