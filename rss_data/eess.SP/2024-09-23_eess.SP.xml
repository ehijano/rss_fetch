      <title>FaFeSort: A Fast and Few-shot End-to-end Neural Network for Multi-channel Spike Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding extracellular recordings is a crucial task in electrophysiology and brain-computer interfaces. Spike sorting, which distinguishes spikes and their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, becomes computationally demanding with the increasing number of channels in modern neural probes. To address the intensive workload and complex neuron interactions, we propose FaFeSort, an end-to-end neural network-based spike sorter with few-shot learning and parallelizable post-processing. Our framework reduces the required number of annotated spikes for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.68% higher accuracy. Additionally, our novel post-processing algorithm is compatible to the deep learning frameworks, making FaFeSort significantly faster than state-of-the-art spike sorters. On synthesized Neuropixels recordings, FaFeSort achieves comparable accuracy with Kilosort4 sorting 50 seconds of data in only 1.32 seconds. Our method demonstrates robustness across various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift conditions, offering a substantial improvement in both accuracy and runtime efficiency comparing to existing spike sorters.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Attention-Based Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Framework for Drift Compensation in Electronic Nose Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous, long-term monitoring of hazardous, noxious, explosive, and flammable gases in industrial environments using electronic nose (E-nose) systems faces the significant challenge of reduced gas identification accuracy due to time-varying drift in gas sensors. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised attention-based multi-source domain shared-private feature fusion adaptation (AMDS-PFFA) framework for gas identification with drift compensation in E-nose systems. The AMDS-PFFA model effectively leverages labeled data from multiple source domains collected during the initial stage to accurately identify gases in unlabeled gas sensor array drift signals from the target domain. To validate the model's effectiveness, extensive experimental evaluations were conducted using both the University of California, Irvine (UCI) standard drift gas dataset, collected over 36 months, and drift signal data from our self-developed E-nose system, spanning 30 months. Compared to recent drift compensation methods, the AMDS-PFFA model achieves the highest average gas recognition accuracy with strong convergence, attaining 83.20% on the UCI dataset and 93.96% on data from our self-developed E-nose system across all target domain batches. These results demonstrate the superior performance of the AMDS-PFFA model in gas identification with drift compensation, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Anti-jamming Transmission of Downlink Cell Free Millimeter-Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, the maximization of resistible jamming power is studied for multi-user downlink millimeter-wave cell-free multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-MIMO) systems. We propose an alternate optimization-based anti-jamming hybrid beamforming (AO-AJHBF) scheme. For receiving beamforming, more practical prior about the jamming channel, i.e., second-order statistics rather than instantaneous information, is exploited via maximizing the generalized Rayleigh quotient. For transmitting beamforming, we use the max-min fairness principle and propose a low-complexity projected gradient ascent-based method to circumvent the excessive computation of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Simulations verify the performance advantage of proposed AO-AJHBF over schemes based on weighted minimum mean square error and SDR methods.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Enhanced Interference Mitigation for Cellular-Connected UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications is an enabling technology to transmit control signaling or payload data for UAVs through cellular networks. Due to the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant air-to-ground channels, efficient interference mitigation is crucial to UAV communications, while the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays have limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) to suppress the interference between the UAV and its non-associated co-channel base stations (BSs). To address this challenge, we propose in this letter a new approach by utilizing the six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) arrays to enhance the interference mitigation for the UAV. Specifically, we propose an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to iteratively optimize the antenna position vector (APV), array rotation vector (ARV), receive beamforming vector, and associated BS of the UAV to maximize its signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Numerical results show that the proposed 6DMA enhanced cellular-connected UAV communication can significantly outperform that with the traditional FPA arrays and other benchmark schemes in terms of interference mitigation.</description>

      <title>MIMO Precoding Exploiting Extra Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in the Wavenumber Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an emerging wavenumber-domain precoding scheme to break the limitations of rank-1 channels that merely supports single-stream transmission, enabling simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams. The proposed wavenumber-domain precoding scheme also breaks the Rayleigh distance demarcation, regardless of the far-field and near-field contexts. Specifically, by characterizing the channel response as the superposition of a series of Fourier harmonics specified by different wavenumbers, the degree of freedom (DoF) is dependent on the cardinality of the wavenumber support, based on which the extra DoF is presented. This representation is applicable for both far-field and near-field. Different wavenumber atoms, determined within this support, constitute the codebook for MIMO precoding, in which each atom allows for the transmission of a data stream. Then, to maximize the capacity, it is required to select the wavenumbers associated with the optimal transmission direction, and optimize its power allocation. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority in comparison to the conventional spatial division schemes, with the potential of approaching the theoretical performance upper bound achieved by singular value decomposition (SVD).</description>

      <title>A Survey of 5G-Based Positioning for Industry 4.0: State of the Art and Enhanced Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth generation (5G) mobile communication technology integrates communication, positioning, and mapping functionalities as an in-built feature. This has drawn significant attention from industries owing to the capability of replacing the traditional wireless technologies used in industries with 5G infrastructure that can be used for both connectivity and positioning. To this end, we identify the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) as a primary use case to benefit from the 5G functionalities. Given that there have been various works focusing on 5G positioning, it is necessary to analyze the existing works about their applicability with AGVs in industrial environments and provide insights to future research. In this paper, we present state of the art in 5G-based positioning, with a focus on key features, such as Millimeter Wave (mmWave) system, Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), Ultra-Dense Network (UDN), Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). Moreover, we present the shortcomings in the current state of the art. Additionally, we propose enhanced techniques that can complement the accuracy of 5G-based positioning in controlled industrial environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency estimation from measurements corrupted by noise is a fundamental challenge across numerous engineering and scientific fields. Among the pivotal factors shaping the resolution capacity of any frequency estimation technique are noise levels and measurement count. Often constrained by practical limitations, the number of measurements tends to be limited. This work introduces a learning-driven approach focused on predicting forthcoming measurements based on available samples. Subsequently, we demonstrate that we can attain high-resolution frequency estimates by combining provided and predicted measurements. In particular, our findings indicate that using just one-third of the total measurements, the method achieves a performance akin to that obtained with the complete set. Unlike existing learning-based frequency estimators, our approach's output retains full interpretability. This work holds promise for developing energy-efficient systems with reduced sampling requirements, which will benefit various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure consistent navigation services despite GNSS signal disruptions, Korea is developing the R-Mode system. This study focuses on enhancing the simulation accuracy of the MF R-Mode system's performance by integrating data from the Eocheong transmitter with existing data from the Palmi and Chungju transmitters. Additional measurements from these three transmitters were gathered using the DARBS receiver to model the Time-of-Arrival(TOA) variance. Analysis of this data facilitated the calculation of new constants and transmitter specific jitter values, which were then used to determine coverage areas based on the updated parameters.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Multimodal Laplacian Dropout (DP-MLD) for EEG Representative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal electroencephalogram (EEG) learning has shown great promise in disease detection. At the same time, ensuring privacy in clinical studies has become increasingly crucial due to legal and ethical concerns. One widely adopted scheme for privacy protection is differential privacy (DP) because of its clear interpretation and ease of implementation. Although numerous methods have been proposed under DP, it has not been extensively studied for multimodal EEG data due to the complexities of models and signal data considered there. In this paper, we propose a novel Differentially Private Multimodal Laplacian Dropout (DP-MLD) scheme for multimodal EEG learning. Our approach proposes a novel multimodal representative learning model that processes EEG data by language models as text and other modal data by vision transformers as images, incorporating well-designed cross-attention mechanisms to effectively extract and integrate cross-modal features. To achieve DP, we design a novel adaptive feature-level Laplacian dropout scheme, where randomness allocation and performance are dynamically optimized within given privacy budgets. In the experiment on an open-source multimodal dataset of Freezing of Gait (FoG) in Parkinson's Disease (PD), our proposed method demonstrates an approximate 4\% improvement in classification accuracy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal EEG learning under DP.</description>

      <title>Improved Image Classification with Manifold Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in various learning tasks, with successful applications in fields like molecular biology, transportation systems, and electrical grids. These fields naturally use graph data, benefiting from GNNs' message-passing framework. However, the potential of GNNs in more general data representations, especially in the image domain, remains underexplored. Leveraging the manifold hypothesis, which posits that high-dimensional data lies in a low-dimensional manifold, we explore GNNs' potential in this context. We construct an image manifold using variational autoencoders, then sample the manifold to generate graphs where each node is an image. This approach reduces data dimensionality while preserving geometric information. We then train a GNN to predict node labels corresponding to the image labels in the classification task, and leverage convergence of GNNs to manifold neural networks to analyze GNN generalization. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that GNNs generalize effectively to unseen graphs, achieving competitive accuracy in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>LiSenNet: Lightweight Sub-band and Dual-Path Modeling for Real-Time Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) aims to extract the clean waveform from noise-contaminated measurements to improve the speech quality and intelligibility. Although learning-based methods can perform much better than traditional counterparts, the large computational complexity and model size heavily limit the deployment on latency-sensitive and low-resource edge devices. In this work, we propose a lightweight SE network (LiSenNet) for real-time applications. We design sub-band downsampling and upsampling blocks and a dual-path recurrent module to capture band-aware features and time-frequency patterns, respectively. A noise detector is developed to detect noisy regions in order to perform SE adaptively and save computational costs. Compared to recent higher-resource-dependent baseline models, the proposed LiSenNet can achieve a competitive performance with only 37k parameters (half of the state-of-the-art model) and 56M multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations per second.</description>

Abstract: Probing beam measurement (PBM)-based hybrid beamforming provides a feasible solution for cell-free MIMO. In this letter, we propose a novel probing beam optimization framework where three collaborative modules respectively realize PBM augmentation, sum-rate prediction and probing beam optimization. Specifically, the PBM augmentation model integrates the conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) and mixture density networks and adopts correlated PBM distribution with full-covariance, for which a Cholesky-decomposition based training is introduced to address the issues of covariance legality and numerical stability. Simulations verify the better performance of the proposed augmentation model compared to the traditional CVAE and the efficiency of proposed optimization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive communication is one of key scenarios of 6G where two magnitude higher connection density would be required to serve diverse services. As a promising direction, unsourced multiple access has been proved to outperform significantly over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or slotted-ALOHA in massive connections. In this paper we describe a design framework of unsourced sparse multiple access (USMA) that consists of two key modules: compressed sensing for preamble generation, and sparse interleaver division multiple access (SIDMA) for main packet transmission. Simulation results of general design of USMA show that the theoretical bound can be approached within 1~1.5 dB by using simple channel codes like convolutional. To illustrate the scalability of USMA, a customized design for ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) is proposed, so that much less memory and computation are required. Simulations results of Rayleigh fading and realistic channel estimation show that USMA based A-IoT solution can deliver nearly 4 times capacity and 6 times efficiency for random access over traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust and Resource-Efficient ADMM-based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) leverages client-server communications to train global models on decentralized data. However, communication noise or errors can impair model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel FL algorithm that enhances robustness against communication noise while also reducing communication load. We derive the proposed algorithm through solving the weighted least-squares (WLS) regression problem as an illustrative example. We first frame WLS regression as a distributed convex optimization problem over a federated network employing random scheduling for improved communication efficiency. We then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively solve this problem. To counteract the detrimental effects of cumulative communication noise, we introduce a key modification by eliminating the dual variable and implementing a new local model update at each participating client. This subtle yet effective change results in using a single noisy global model update at each client instead of two, improving robustness against additive communication noise. Furthermore, we incorporate another modification enabling clients to continue local updates even when not selected by the server, leading to substantial performance improvements. Our theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of our algorithm in both mean and the mean-square senses, even when the server communicates with a random subset of clients over noisy links at each iteration. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback in Massive MIMO via ID-Photo-Inspired Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has shown great potential in improving spectrum efficiency in massive MIMO systems. However, DL models optimized for specific environments often experience performance degradation in others due to model mismatch. To overcome this barrier in the practical deployment, we propose UniversalNet, an ID-photo-inspired universal CSI feedback framework that enhances model generalizability by standardizing the input format across diverse data distributions. Specifically, UniversalNet employs a standardized input format to mitigate the influence of environmental variability, coupled with a lightweight sparsity-aligning operation in the transformed sparse domain and marginal control bits for original format recovery. This enables seamless integration with existing CSI feedback models, requiring minimal modifications in preprocessing and postprocessing without updating neural network weights. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective eigenvector joint phase optimization technique to enhance the sparsity of the precoding matrix by reducing phase randomness, thus improving the implicit CSI compression efficiency. Test results demonstrate that UniversalNet effectively improves generalization and ensures precise CSI feedback, even in scenarios with limited training diversity and previously unseen CSI environments.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy efficiency (EE) is a challenging task in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where high spectral efficiency and low energy consumption appear as conflicting requirements. Although passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing the EE of the ISAC system, the multiplicative fading feature hinders its effectiveness. This paper proposes the use of active RIS with its amplification gains to assist the ISAC system for EE improvement. Specifically, we formulate an EE optimization problem in an active RIS-aided ISAC system under system power budgets, considering constraints on user communication quality of service and sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A novel alternating optimization algorithm is developed to address the highly non-convex problem by leveraging a combination of the generalized Rayleigh quotient optimization approach, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. Furthermore, to accelerate the algorithm and reduce computational complexity, we derive a semi-closed form for eigenvalue determination. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing significant improvements in EE compared to both passive RIS and spectrum efficiency optimization cases.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Thoughts: A Review of Advancements in EEG Brain Signal Decoding into Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conversion of brain activity into text using electroencephalography (EEG) has gained significant traction in recent years. Many researchers are working to develop new models to decode EEG signals into text form. Although this area has shown promising developments, it still faces numerous challenges that necessitate further improvement. It's important to outline this area's recent developments and future research directions. In this review article, we thoroughly summarize the progress in EEG-to-text conversion. Firstly, we talk about how EEG-to-text technology has grown and what problems we still face. Secondly, we discuss existing techniques used in this field. This includes methods for collecting EEG data, the steps to process these signals, and the development of systems capable of translating these signals into coherent text. We conclude with potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for enhanced accuracy, reduced system constraints, and the exploration of novel applications across varied sectors. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to contribute to developing more accessible and effective Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology for a broader user base.</description>

      <title>Secure Transmission for Movable Antennas Empowered Cell-Free Symbiotic Radio Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission scheme is designed for cell-free symbiotic radio (SR) systems in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Specifically, multiple distributed access points (APs) equipped with MAs collaboratively transmit confidential information to the primary user (PU), in the meanwhile the backscatter device (BD) transmits its own information to the secondary user (SU) by reflecting incident signals from the APs. The MAs deployed at the APs can adjust their positions flexibly to improve channel conditions between the APs and the PU/SU/BD and suppress the eavesdropping from the Eve on confidential information at the PU. Under this setup, we maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission through jointly optimizing the APs' transmission beamforming vectors and the positions of the MAs, while adhering to the quality of service constraints at the SU. To address the challenges caused by the non-convexity and find a near-optimal solution, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed, utilizing the successive convex approximation method, the semi-definite relaxation technology and a genetic algorithm modified particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the secrecy rate enhancement provided by utilizing the MAs and show the impact of the GA-PSO algorithm for improving the solving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learned Nonlinear Predictor for Critically Sampled 3D Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 3D point cloud attribute compression via a volumetric approach: assuming point cloud geometry is known at both encoder and decoder, parameters $\theta$ of a continuous attribute function $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ are quantized to $\hat{\theta}$ and encoded, so that discrete samples $f_{\hat{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}_i)$ can be recovered at known 3D points $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ at the decoder. Specifically, we consider a nested sequences of function subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_L$, where $\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ is a family of functions spanned by B-spline basis functions of order $p$, $f_l^*$ is the projection of $f$ on $\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ represented as low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$, and $g_l^*$ is the residual function in an orthogonal subspace $\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)}$ (where $\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)} \oplus \mathcal{F}_l^{(p)} = \mathcal{F}_{l+1}^{(p)}$) represented as high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$. In this paper, to improve coding performance over \cite{do2023volumetric}, we study predicting $f_{l+1}^*$ at level $l+1$ given $f_l^*$ at level $l$ and encoding of $G_l^*$ for the $p=1$ case (RAHT($1$)). For the prediction, we formalize RAHT(1) linear prediction in MPEG-PCC in a theoretical framework, and propose a new nonlinear predictor using a polynomial of bilateral filter. We derive equations to efficiently compute the critically sampled high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$ amenable to encoding. We optimize parameters in our resulting feed-forward network on a large training set of point clouds by minimizing a rate-distortion Lagrangian. Experimental results show that our improved framework outperforms the MPEG G-PCC predictor by $11\%$--$12\%$ in bit rate.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of "least-favorable" distributions to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>
