      <title>The Hardness of Learning Quantum Circuits and its Cryptographic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that concrete hardness assumptions about learning or cloning the output state of a random quantum circuit can be used as the foundation for secure quantum cryptography. In particular, under these assumptions we construct secure one-way state generators (OWSGs), digital signature schemes, quantum bit commitments, and private key encryption schemes. We also discuss evidence for these hardness assumptions by analyzing the best-known quantum learning algorithms, as well as proving black-box lower bounds for cloning and learning given state preparation oracles.
  Our random circuit-based constructions provide concrete instantiations of quantum cryptographic primitives whose security do not depend on the existence of one-way functions. The use of random circuits in our constructions also opens the door to NISQ-friendly quantum cryptography. We discuss noise tolerant versions of our OWSG and digital signature constructions which can potentially be implementable on noisy quantum computers connected by a quantum network. On the other hand, they are still secure against noiseless quantum adversaries, raising the intriguing possibility of a useful implementation of an end-to-end cryptographic protocol on near-term quantum computers. Finally, our explorations suggest that the rich interconnections between learning theory and cryptography in classical theoretical computer science also extend to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions, symmetries, and tunneling in Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are systems out of equilibrium with a wide range of applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and fundamental research. They have been realized in superconducting circuits and photonic platforms. In this work, we explore the onset of ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions in KPOs, focusing on the role of the phase-space rotational symmetry when the driving frequency is $\mu$ times the oscillator's natural frequency, specifically for $\mu=1,2,3,4$. These cases are experimentally accessible in superconducting circuits, where the Floquet quasienergy spectrum can also be studied as a function of tunable control parameters. Using the classical Hamiltonian of the system, we identify the critical points associated with quantum phase transitions and analyze the emergence of both real and avoided level crossings, examining their influence on the energy spectrum and tunneling dynamics. Our findings provide insights into the engineering of robust quantum states, quantum dynamics control, and onset of quantum phase transitions with implications for critical quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficiently learning fermionic unitaries with few non-Gaussian gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian unitaries are known to be efficiently learnable and simulatable. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that learns an $n$-mode circuit containing $t$ parity-preserving non-Gaussian gates. While circuits with $t = \textrm{poly}(n)$ are unlikely to be efficiently learnable, for constant $t$, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for learning the description of the unknown fermionic circuit within a small diamond-distance error. Building on work that studies the state-learning version of this problem, our approach relies on learning approximate Gaussian unitaries that transform the circuit into one that acts non-trivially only on a constant number of Majorana operators. Our result also holds for the case where we have a qubit implementation of the fermionic unitary.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branch-and-bound algorithms effectively solve combinatorial optimization problems, relying on the relaxation of the objective function to obtain tight lower bounds. While this is straightforward for convex objective functions, higher-order formulations pose challenges due to their inherent non-convexity. In this work, we propose branch-and-bound digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BB-DCQO), a quantum algorithm that addresses the relaxation difficulties in higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. By employing bias fields as approximate solutions to the relaxed problem, we iteratively enhance the quality of the results compared to the bare bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm. We refer to this enhanced method as BBB-DCQO. In order to benchmark it against simulated annealing (SA), we apply it on sparse HUBO instances with up to $156$ qubits using tensor network simulations. To explore regimes that are less tractable for classical simulations, we experimentally apply BBB-DCQO to denser problems using up to 100 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We compare our results with SA and a greedy-tuned quantum annealing baseline. In both simulations and experiments, BBB-DCQO consistently achieved higher-quality solutions with significantly reduced computational overhead, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating counterdiabatic quantum methods into branch-and-bound to address hard non-convex optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Blade-Type Linear Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design, implementation, and construction of a linear Paul trap in a blade configuration. The trap was optimized to minimize micromotion and enable the formation of linear ion chains comprising tens of ions. We use ytterbium atoms, and in particular, we describe the trapping and cooling of the isotopes $^{174} \mathrm{Yb}^+$ and $^{171} \mathrm{Yb}^+$, starting from an isotope-selective ionization process based on laser frequency stabilization and optimization of fluorescence for each isotope. The electronic control system-including magnetic field generation, laser delivery, and microwave driving-was fully implemented and is described in detail. The system supports pulsed operation, and we performed Rabi oscillations of the hyperfine states in the $^2 \mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ level, demonstrating coherent spectroscopy. These capabilities are fundamental tools for the experiments we aim to pursue, including the use of structured light beams, quantum simulation protocols, and the generation of non-classical motional states.</description>

      <title>Thirty-six officers, artisanally entangled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is maximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of "36 officers". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. (In particular, Leonhard would have had no means of dealing with such solutions to his own puzzle -- an unsatisfactory state of affairs). In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and \.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>Magnetic recoil interferometer in a uniform gravitational field. Comment on Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the phase shift of a matter-wave interferometer looks different for different coordinate choices or the addition of a uniform gravitational field, but the final result of the observable phase shift does not depend on the coordinate choices or the uniform gravitational field. We find that the phase shift observed in ``Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves'' is a magnetic recoil phase shift, similar to the recoil phase shift in light-pulse interferometers. Recoil phase shifts are inversely proportional to the inertial mass and do not depend on the gravitational mass. Our analysis highlights the difference between magnetic and gravitational acceleration in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Verifiable End-to-End Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising candidates for solving complex optimization and machine learning tasks on near-term quantum hardware. However, executing quantum operations remains challenging for small-scale users because of several hardware constraints, making it desirable to delegate parts of the computation to more powerful quantum devices. In this work, we introduce a framework for delegated variational quantum algorithms (DVQAs), where a client with limited quantum capabilities delegates the execution of a VQA to a more powerful quantum server. In particular, we introduce a protocol that enables a client to delegate a variational quantum algorithm to a server while ensuring that the input, the output and also the computation itself remain secret. Additionally, if the protocol does not abort, the client can be certain that the computation outcome is indeed correct. This work builds on the general verification protocol introduced by Fitzimons and Kashefi (2017), tailoring it to VQAs. Our approach first proposes a verifiable Protocol for delegating the quantum computation required at each optimization step of a VQA, and then combines the iterative steps into an error-resilient optimization process that offers end-to-end verifiable algorithm execution. We also simulate the performance of our protocol tackling the Transverse Field Ising Model. Our results demonstrate that secure delegation of variational quantum algorithms is a realistic solution for near-term quantum networks, paving the way for practical quantum cloud computing applications.</description>

      <title>Bosonic quantum many-body simulation with waveguide photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation-Based Optimization of a Cooling System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering processes involve iterative design evaluations requiring numerous computationally intensive numerical simulations. Quantum algorithms promise up to exponential speedups for specific tasks relevant to numerical simulations. However, these advantages quickly vanish when considering data input and output on quantum computers. The recently introduced Quantum Simulation-Based Optimization (QuSO) algorithm circumvents this fundamental impediment by treating simulations as subproblems within a larger optimization problem. In this paper, we adapt and implement QuSO for a cooling system design problem. We validate the algorithm through statevector simulations and provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis indicating that the achievable speedup for this particular example is at most polynomial. Notably, we also specify the conditions under which QuSO could deliver exponential advantages. By providing this comprehensive demonstration, we highlight both the promise and practical constraints of QuSO in an engineering context, motivating further research into quantum algorithms for classical simulations and the search for suitable applications.</description>

      <title>Long-lived entanglement of a spin-qubit register in silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and a long-lived electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits long spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$ ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$ ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$ ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$ ms. Our results show that T centers can realize a long-lived multi-qubit register with an optical interface in silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Cayley's First Hyperdeterminant is an Entanglement Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was shown that both the concurrence and n-tangle on $2n$-qubits can be expressed in terms of Cayley's first hyperdeterminant, indicating that Cayley's first hyperdeterminant captures at least some aspects of a quantum state's entanglement. In this paper, we rigorously prove that Cayley's first hyperdeterminant is an entanglement measure on $2n$-qudits, and thus a legitimate generalization of the concurrence and n-tangle. In particular, we show that the modulus of the hyperdeterminant and its square both vanish on separable $2n$-qudits, are LU invariants, and are non-increasing on average under LOCC. Lastly, we then consider their convex roof extensions and show that they may in fact be viewed as entanglement measures on mixed states of $2n$-qudits.</description>

      <title>Fully passive reference frame independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution (RFI QKD) significantly alleviates alignment requirements for reference frame in practical quantum communication systems. While the original protocol requires Alice to prepare six quantum states in $Z$, $X$, and $Y$ bases, its reliance on active modulation introduces inherent side-channel vulnerabilities from device imperfections. We address this security limitation by integrating a fully passive source into the RFI framework. In this paper, we propose a fully passive RFI QKD protocol. Our protocol avoids active modulation entirely, suppressing side-channel risks through passive quantum state generation. Moreover, by making full utilization of the quantum states generated by the fully passive source, we enhance the secure key rate of fully passive protocol. We establish a system model to analyze the performance of the protocol. Through the optimization of post-selection intervals and intensities, we obtain the maximum secure key transmission rate of the protocol. Under ideal circumstances, the secure key transmission rate of our protocol can reach more than 50% of that of the ideal QKD. Under practical conditions, we have considered the finite-length effect. When pulse number generated by the source reaches $10^{12}$, the maximum communication distances of the protocol can reach 167 km and 136 km with a reference frame misalignment of $0 $ and $45^{\circ} $ respectively. We believe that our protocol can contribute to the development of practical QKD systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnon blockade effect in a quantum magnonic system operating in the strong dispersive regime, where a superconducting qubit interacts dispersively with a magnonic mode in a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere.By solving the quantum master equation, we demonstrate that the magnon blockade, characterized by the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0) \rightarrow 0.04$, emerges under optimal dispersive coupling and driving detuning.The mechanism is attributed to suppressed two-magnon transitions as a result of qubit-induced anharmonicity. Notably, our study identifies the critical role of dispersive interaction strength and environmental temperature, showing that magnon blockade remains observable under experimentally achievable cryogenic conditions.This work extends the magnon blockade effect into the dispersive regime, offering a robust platform for single-magnon manipulation and advancing applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

Abstract: Daniel McNulty $et.al$ \cite{commentMUB} voiced suspicions to the Lemma 11(v) Part 6 in \cite{Chen2017Product} and three theorems derived in later publications \cite{Liang2019,lma2020,xyc}. For these suspicions, we reprove that any $6\times 6$ complex Hadamard matrix whose number of real elements more than 22 does not belong to a set of four mutually unbiased bases. We show that the number of $2\times 2$ complex Hadamard submatrices of any $H_2$-reducible matrix is not $10,...,16,18$. We also put forward some possible directions for further development.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Sampling Random Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for sampling random spanning trees from a weighted graph in $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{mn})$ time, where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Our algorithm has sublinear runtime for dense graphs and achieves a quantum speedup over the best-known classical algorithm, which runs in $\widetilde{O}(m)$ time. The approach carefully combines, on one hand, a classical method based on ``large-step'' random walks for reduced mixing time and, on the other hand, quantum algorithmic techniques, including quantum graph sparsification and a sampling-without-replacement variant of Hamoudi's multiple-state preparation. We also establish a matching lower bound, proving the optimality of our algorithm up to polylogarithmic factors. These results highlight the potential of quantum computing in accelerating fundamental graph sampling problems.</description>

      <title>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants are crucial for characterizing topological systems. However, experimentally measuring them presents a significant challenge, especially in non-Hermitian systems where the biorthogonal eigenvectors are often necessary. We propose a general approach for measuring the topological invariants of one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, which can be derived from the spin textures of right eigenstates. By utilizing a dilation method, we realize a non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry on a two-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system and measure the winding number associated with the eigenstates. In addition to examining the topology of the eigenstates, our experiment also reveals the topological structure of the energy band, which differs from that in chiral systems. Our work paves the way for further exploration of complex topological properties in non-Hermitian systems without chiral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced randomized measurement in noisy quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum hardware is advancing rapidly across various platforms, yet implementing large-scale quantum error correction (QEC) remains challenging. As hardware continues to improve, there is a growing need to identify potential applications on noisy quantum devices that can leverage these enhancements. With this motivation, we explore the advantages of shallow measurements over (non-entangling) single-qubit measurements for learning various properties of a quantum state. While previous studies have examined this subject, they have primarily focused on specific problems. Here, by developing a new theoretical framework, we demonstrate how shallow measurements can benefit in diverse scenarios. Despite the additional errors from two-qubit gates in shallow measurements, we experimentally validated improvements compared to single-qubit measurements in applications like derandomization, common randomized measurements, and machine learning up to 40 qubits and 46 layers of two-qubit gates, respectively. As a result, we show that hardware improvements, even before QEC, could broaden the range of feasible applications.</description>

      <title>(Thermo-)dynamics of the spin-boson model in the weak coupling regime: Application as a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</description>

      <title>Zernike system revisited: imaginary gauge and Higgs oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze that recently proposed clasical/quantum mechanical interpretation of Zernike system and establish its equivalence to the Higgs oscillator on sphere or pseudosphere (Lobachevsky plane). We show that the non-reality of the classical Zernike Hamiltonian is an insignificant artifact of imaginary gauge and can be eliminated with a canonical transformation. The quantum counterpart of this canonical transformation is a similarity transformation mapping the system to the quantum Higgs oscillator with integration measure depending on $\alpha,\beta$ parameters. When $\alpha=2 \beta$ it results in the Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle on (pseudo)sphere, while deviation from this point leads to a pseudo-Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead error detection with spacetime codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a low-overhead approach for detecting errors in arbitrary Clifford circuits on arbitrary qubit connectivities. Our method is based on the framework of spacetime codes, and is particularly suited to near-term hardware since it has a much milder overhead in qubits and gates compared to error correction, while achieving a better sampling overhead than existing error mitigation methods. We present efficient algorithms for finding valid checks that are simultaneously low weight, satisfy connectivity constraints, and cover large detecting regions within the circuit. Using this approach, we experimentally demonstrate error detection on circuits of up to 50 logical qubits containing 2450 CZ gates, and show physical to logical fidelity gains of up to $236\times$. Furthermore, we show our algorithm can efficiently find checks in universal circuits, but the space of valid checks diminishes exponentially with the non-Cliffordness of the circuit. These theoretical and experimental results suggest that Clifford-dominated circuits are promising candidates for near-term quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Lattice surgery-based logical state teleportation via noisy links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For planar architectures surface code-based quantum error correction is one of the most promising approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation. This is partially due to the variety of fault-tolerant logical protocols that can be implemented in two dimensions using local operations. One such protocol is the lattice surgery-based logical state teleportation, which transfers a logical quantum state from an initial location on a quantum chip to a target location through a linking region of qubits. This protocol serves as a basis for higher-level routines, such as the entangling CNOT gate or magic state injection. In this work we investigate the correctability phase diagram of this protocol for distinct error rates inside the surface code patches and within the linking region. We adopt techniques from statistical physics to describe the numerically observed crossover regime between correctable and uncorrectable quantum error correction phases, where the correctability depends on the separation between the initial and target locations. We find that inside the crossover regime the correctability-threshold lines decay as a power law with increasing separation, which we explain accurately using a finite-size scaling analysis. Our results indicate that the logical state teleportation protocol can tolerate much higher noise rates in the linking region compared to the bulk of the surface code patches, provided the separation between the positions is relatively small.</description>

      <title>Quantum excitation transfer in bosonic networks: a bipartite-graph framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly efficient transfer of quantum resources including quantum excitations, states, and information on quantum networks is an important task in quantum information science. Here, we propose a bipartite-graph framework for studying quantum excitation transfer in bosonic networks by diagonalizing the intermediate sub-network between the sender and the receiver to construct a bipartite-graph configuration. We examine the statistical properties of the bosonic networks in both the original and bipartite-graph representations. In particular, we investigate quantum excitation transfer in both the finite and infinite intermediate-normal-mode cases, and show the dependence of the transfer efficiency on the network configurations and system parameters. We find the bound of maximally transferred excitations for various network configurations and reveal the underlying physical mechanisms. We also find that the dark-mode effect will degrade the excitation transfer efficiency. Our findings provide a new insight for the design and optimization of quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore Zernike modes as a novel degree of freedom for quantum information processing. We propose procedures for generating photons in these modes as well as for their manipulation, entanglement, and detection. Entanglement in Zernike modes is demonstrated analytically for the two-photon state produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This entanglement arises from specific constraints on the mode indices of the expansion coefficients of the down-converted Zernike fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limits in Qubit Dynamics Driven by Bistable Random Telegraph Noise: From Markovian to Non-Markovian Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum speed limit (QSL) of a single superconducting qubit subjected to pure dephasing induced by bistable random telegraph noise (RTN), a common environmental disturbance in solid state quantum systems. Using an exactly solvable model, we explore how the interplay between RTN parameters the switching rate, coupling strength, and initial condition governs the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. A coherence based measure is employed to quantify non-Markovianity, and a unified quantum speed limit bound is derived based on relative purity. Our results reveal that in thermodynamic equilibrium, non-Markovian memory effects significantly reduce the quantum speed limit time, accelerating quantum evolution through information backflow. In contrast, under non-equilibrium initial conditions, the system exhibits purely Markovian behavior regardless of coupling strength, although strong coupling still leads to speedup via enhanced dephasing. These findings offer valuable insights for designing fast and noise resilient quantum protocols by controlling both dynamical parameters and noise initialization.</description>

Abstract: Efficiently certifying non-Gaussian entanglement in continuous-variable quantum systems is a central challenge for advancing quantum information processing, photonic quantum computing, and metrology. Here, we put forward continuous-variable counterparts of the recently introduced entanglement criteria based on moments of the partially transposed state, together with simple readout schemes that require only a few replicas of the state, passive linear optics, and particle-number measurements. Our multicopy method enables the detection of genuine non-Gaussian entanglement for various relevant state families overlooked by standard approaches, which includes the entire class of NOON states. Further, it is robust against realistic experimental constraints (losses, noise, and finite statistics), which we demonstrate by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol restoring the state transferred along the spin chain governed by the XY-Hamiltonian. Such dynamics does not preserve the excitation number and leads to mixing multiple-quantum coherence matrices of orders having the same parities. Depending on the initial state, this results in
  generating ether all possible or only even-order multiple-quantum coherence matrices. Restoring is established via the special unitary transformation applied to the receiver side of the chain (extended receiver). An example of restoring $\pm1$ and $\pm 2$-order coherence matrices in two-qubit state transfer is considered. Entanglement transfer in such process is also studied and possibility of its amplification is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for implementing the Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) transformation, a technique widely used in simulations of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians. DVR provides a diagonal representation of local operators and enables sparse Hamiltonian structures, making it a powerful alternative to the finite basis representation (FBR), particularly in high-dimensional problems. While DVR has been extensively used in classical simulations, its quantum implementation, particularly using Gaussian quadrature grids, remains underexplored. We develop a quantum circuit that efficiently transforms FBR into DVR by following a recursive construction based on quantum arithmetic operations, and we compare this approach with methods that directly load DVR matrix elements using quantum read-only memory (QROM). We analyze the quantum resources, including T-gate and qubit counts, required for implementing the DVR unitary and discuss preferable choices of QROM-based and recursive-based methods for a given matrix size and precision. This study lays the groundwork for utilizing DVR Hamiltonians in quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation with block encoding.</description>

      <title>Non-demolition fluorescence readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of a fluxonium qubit via dissipation engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-demolition readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of qubits are key requirements for practical quantum computation. For superconducting qubits, readout and reset are typically realized using resonators based on dispersive approximation. However, violations of the approximation often lead to detrimental effects on the qubit. In this work, we demonstrate non-demolition fluorescence readout and high-fidelity unconditional reset of a fluxonium qubit via dissipation engineering without employing a resonator. We design and implement a planar filter to protect the qubit from energy relaxation while enhancing the relaxation of the readout transition. By appropriately selecting the readout transition, we achieve fluorescence readout with enhanced quantum non-demolitionness. We also realize fast, high-fidelity and all-microwave unconditional reset of the fluxonium qubit. These results highlight the potential of superconducting-quantum computing architectures without relying on dispersive interaction between qubits and resonators.</description>

      <title>Detector of microwave photon pairs based on a Josephson photomultiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a viable design of a microwave two-photon threshold detector. In essence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon detector - a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM) - an absorbing microwave detector based on a capacitively-shunted rf SQUID. To implement a two-photon threshold detector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators interacting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively coupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the external flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative two-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the coherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in another resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least two photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand \textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the modified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate that, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\%$ fidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may serve as a building block for the implementation of efficient photon-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning advantages beyond hardness of evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most general examples of quantum learning advantages involve data labeled by cryptographic or intrinsically quantum functions, where classical learners are limited by the infeasibility of evaluating the labeling functions using polynomial-sized classical circuits. While broad in scope, such results reveal little about advantages arising from the learning process itself. In cryptographic settings, further insight is possible via random-generatability - the ability to classically generate labeled data - enabling hardness proofs for identification tasks, where the goal is to identify the labeling function from a dataset, even when evaluation is classically intractable. These tasks are particularly relevant in quantum contexts, including Hamiltonian learning and identifying physically meaningful order parameters. However, for quantum functions, random-generatability is conjectured not to hold, leaving no known identification advantages in genuinely quantum regimes.
  In this work, we give the first proofs of quantum identification learning advantages under standard complexity assumptions. We confirm that quantum-hard functions are not random-generatable unless BQP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, ruling out cryptographic-style data generation strategies. We then introduce a new approach: we show that verifiable identification - solving the identification task for valid datasets while rejecting invalid ones - is classically hard for quantum labeling functions unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we show that, for a broad class of tasks, solving the identification problem implies verifiable identification in the polynomial hierarchy. This yields our main result: a natural class of quantum identification tasks solvable by quantum learners but hard for classical learners unless BQP is in the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Making Neural Networks More Suitable for Approximate Clifford+T Circuit Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning with deep neural networks has transformed computational approaches to scientific and engineering problems. Central to many of these advancements are precisely tuned neural architectures that are tailored to the domains in which they are used. In this work, we develop deep learning techniques and architectural modifications that improve performance on reinforcement learning guided quantum circuit synthesis-the task of constructing a circuit that implements a given unitary matrix. First, we propose a global phase invariance operation which makes our architecture resilient to complex global phase shifts. Second, we demonstrate how augmenting data with small random unitary perturbations during training enables more robust learning. Finally, we show how encoding numerical data with techniques from image processing allow networks to better detect small but significant changes in data. Our work enables deep learning approaches to better synthesize quantum circuits that implement unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Clifford and Non-Clifford Splitting in Quantum Circuits: Applications and ZX-Calculus Detection Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum circuits is a pivotal part of the quantum computing landscape, specially within the NISQ era, where the constraints imposed by available hardware are unavoidable. The Gottesman-Knill theorem further motivates this argument by accentuating the importance of Clifford circuits and their role on this topic of simulation. In this work, we propose and analyze use cases that come from quantum circuits that can be written as product between a Clifford and a Non-Clifford unitary, these ranging from fully classical emulation, hybrid quantum-classical execution or even quantum algorithm simplification. To further complement this analysis, we make use of ZX-Calculus and its assets to detect a limiting border of these circuits that would allow for a separation between a Clifford section and a Non-Clifford section. To achieve this, we present a novel procedure for parsing ZX diagrams, that not only allows for the detection of this border but also simplifies the circuit extraction process.</description>

      <title>Full dynamics of two-membrane cavity optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a two-membrane cavity optomechanical setup, two semi-transparent membranes placed within an optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity yield a nontrivial dependence of the frequency of a mode of the optical cavity on the membranes' positions, which is due to interference. However, the system dynamics is typically described by a radiation pressure force treatment in which the frequency shift is expanded stopping at first order in the membrane displacements. In this paper, we study the full dynamics of the system obtained by considering the exact nonlinear dependence of the optomechanical interaction between two membranes' vibrational modes and the driven cavity mode. We then compare this dynamics with the standard treatment based on the Hamiltonian linear interaction, and we find the conditions under which the two dynamics may significantly depart from each other. In particular, we see that a parameter regime exists in which the customary first-order treatment provides distinct and incorrect predictions for the synchronization of two self-sustained mechanical limit-cycles, and for Gaussian entanglement of the two membranes in the case of two-tone driving.</description>

      <title>An Error Mitigated Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver via Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a shadow-tomography-enhanced Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver (NOQE) for more efficient and accurate electronic structure calculations on near-term quantum devices. By integrating shadow tomography into the NOQE, the measurement cost scales linearly rather than quadratically with the number of reference states, while also reducing the required qubits and circuit depth by half. This approach enables extraction of all matrix elements via randomized measurements and classical postprocessing. We analyze its sample complexity and show that, for small systems, it remains constant in the high-precision regime, while for larger systems, it scales linearly with the system size. We further apply shadow-based error mitigation to suppress noise-induced bias without increasing quantum resources. Demonstrations on the hydrogen molecule in the strongly correlated regime achieve chemical accuracy under realistic noise, showing that our method is both resource-efficient and noise-resilient for practical quantum chemistry simulations in the near term.</description>

      <title>Fidelity and efficiency analysis for heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels: linear and nonlinear optical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell state measurements (BSMs) of photonic qubits are used for quantum networking protocols to herald the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, standard BSMs based on linear optics (LO-BSMs) require identical photons and are susceptible to errors from multiphoton emissions, leading to reduced fidelity of protocols, particularly in the absence of postselection. To overcome these challenges, Bell state measurements based on nonlinear optics (NLO-BSMs) have been proposed and implemented, leveraging sum-frequency generation (SFG) to filter out multiphoton emissions and improve the fidelity without postselection. Here we analyze the fidelity of LO-BSM and NLO-BSM heralded entanglement swapping in lossy channels and compare their performance under realistic conditions. We also explore the impact of state-of-the-art nonlinear photonics platforms on SFG efficiency and highlight how advances in nanophotonics will enable practical, high-fidelity NLO-BSM-based quantum networking applications.</description>

      <title>Universality of entanglement in gluon dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of fundamental degrees of freedom in particle physics is generated ab initio in scattering processes. In the case of a pure $SU(N)$ gauge theory, two gluons in a product state can be entangled in their polarizations as the result of three- and four-gluon vertex interactions. We find that entanglement is only produced when the initial product state have opposite polarizations, and that maximal entanglement is generated when the outgoing particles form an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with respect to the incoming ones. A surprising result is that the amount of entanglement among gluon polarizations is independent of the gauge group at any angle and, thus, of the color degree of freedom. Universality of entanglement for any gauge group emerges. It is also found that a small deviation of the relative weight between three- and four-gluon vertices would prevent the generation of maximal entanglement. This can be seen as a small piece of a possible it from qubit principle underlying fundamental interactions, that is a principle that requires physics to be quantum in origin.</description>

      <title>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extraction tests of Compton Form Factors are performed using pseudodata based on experimental data from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering experiments conducted at Jefferson Lab. The standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and Muller formalism at twist-two is employed, along with a fitting procedure designed to reduce model dependency similar to traditional local fits. The extraction of the Compton Form Factors is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). Comparative studies reveal that QDNNs outperform CDNNs for this application, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy and precision even for limited model complexity. The results demonstrate the potential of QDNNs for future studies in which quantum algorithms can be fully optimized.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mounting interest in conducting thorough analyses and studies of long-range interactions stems from their wide-ranging applications in cold atomic physics, making it a compelling area for research. In this work, we have evaluated long range van der Waals dispersion (vdW) interactions of Cu and Ag atoms with atoms of group I (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr), II (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and {Ba}), XII (Zn, Cd, and Hg) {as well as} singly charged ions of group II (Be$^+$, Mg$^+$, Ca$^+$, Sr$^+$, and {Ba$^+$}) and XII (Zn$^+$, Cd$^+$, and Hg$^+$) by calculating $C_6$(two-body) and $C_9$ (three-body) vdW dispersion coefficients. In order to obtain these $C_6$ and $C_9$ coefficients, we have evaluated the dynamic dipole polarizability of the considered atoms using appropriate relativistic methods and the sum-over-states approach. To ascertain the accuracy of our results, we have compared the evaluated static dipole polarizabilities of Cu and Ag atoms and their oscillator strengths for dominant transitions {with} available literature. The calculated values of $C_6$ dispersion coefficients have also been compared with the previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $4D_{3/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$--$4D_{5/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$ transition in Nb$^{4+}$ for a THz atomic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the $4D_{3/2}|3,\pm2\rangle \rightarrow 4D_{5/2}|3,\pm2\rangle$ transition in the Nb$^{4+}$ ion is identified as a promising candidate for a terahertz (THz) atomic clock, with the transition frequency occurring at 56.0224 THz. This transition is primarily driven by the magnetic dipole decay channel, which can easily be accessed by a laser. We focus on the stable $^{93}$Nb isotope, which has 100\% natural abundance and a nuclear spin of $I=9/2$ for experimental advantage. Our data analysis allows us to estimate potential systematic shifts in the proposed clock system, including those due to blackbody radiation, electric quadrupole, second-order Zeeman, and second-order Doppler {shifts}. {The scheme presented in this study can help suppress the AC Stark and electric quadrupole shifts in the clock frequency measurement.} {All these analyses} suggest that the proposed THz atomic clock using Nb$^{4+}$ could be valuable in both quantum thermometry and frequency metrology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new methods for solving Set Constraint Problems. While current methods focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Finally, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity and high-resolution collaborative determination of birefringence coefficient using weak measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-sensitivity and high-resolution birefringence coefficient determination system for nm-level membrane films based on weak measurement, addressing the sensitivity-resolution trade-off. A tunable bandwidth light source is exploited to achieve complementary momentum (P-pointer) and intensity (I-pointer) measurements,enabling calibration-free operation across various bandwidths, and to realize high-precision phase difference monitoring of the measured membranes.This method maps the birefringence effect to a weak-value amplified signal of spectral shift and light intensity. The optimal resolution, achieved at a spectral width of 6 nm, is $1.5 \times 10^{-8}$ RIU, while the optimal sensitivity is achieved when the light source is a narrow-linewidth coherent laser, reaching 4710 mV/RIU. The linear range of the system covers a broad birefringence coefficient range for crystals,from $10^{-6}$ to 0.1. Furthermore, the auxiliary optical path eliminates substrate interference, achieving a detection limit of the birefringence coefficient as low as $10^{-8}$ RIU.This approach, characterized high precision, high sensitivity, and strong robustness, provides an effective solution for the detection of optical nano-thin membrane parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks that depend smoothly on a small parameter $\varepsilon\ge0$ are considered on directed graphs. The asymptotic behavior of the scattering matrix of the quantum walk as $\varepsilon\to+0$ is investigated. It is shown that, in this limit, the scattering matrix does not converge to that for $\varepsilon=0$ at points in the essential spectrum (the unit circle) that are asymptotically approached by a quantum resonance. Furthermore, a phenomenon resembling and extending the resonant tunneling effect is observed by analyzing this discrepancy through resonant states.</description>

      <title>Inverse Drexhage effect in Epsilon-Near-Zero Substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drexhage effect, caused by interference between a dipole and its image formed in a substrate, modifies the local density of optical states of quantum emitters which can either enhance or suppress their spontaneous emission rate depending on the dipole orientation and distance from the substrate. Here, we show that for an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) substrate, the observed orientation and distance dependence of the spontaneous emission rate is reversed compared to metals. This inverse Drexhage effect is studied for ideal ENZ and real ENZ substrates compared with ideal and real metallic substrates. ENZ metamaterials consisting of a subwavelength metal-dielectric stack are shown to exhibit the conventional Drexhage effects due to the large optical losses associated with these materials. Our results could find applications in quantum sensing, quantum information, and energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications in precision acceleration and force sensing, as well as testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which often require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens enables stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for the collection of scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Autodistillation in Baryon Pair Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spin-entangled mixed state of a spin-1/2 baryon-antibaryon pair produced in the process e+e- to J/psi, psi(2S) to BBbar. We demonstrate that the spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B to b + M and Bbar to bbar + Mbar, where b and bbar are spin-1/2 baryons and M, Mbar are spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation, represents a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay process. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that it depends only on the initial state of the BBbar system and the decay parameter alphaD, but not on the phase parameter phiD.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive angulons in superfluid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the in- and out-of-equilibrium phenomena of a rotational impurity -- specifically, a linear molecule -- coupled to a nonconventional environment, a helium nanodroplet. By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like transformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we self-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath and accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's rotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal that, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in interacting environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum circuit simulations of the transverse field Ising model with longitudinal fields, displaying salient features of glassy dynamics. The energy landscape and spin configurations of toy models are considered, using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to obtain the ground-state energies and corresponding eigenstates for a $6 \times 6$ Ising lattice using 36 qubits and a 1-dimensional Ising chain of length 25 using 25 qubits. The former showed disordered spin configurations for a specific mixture of values of the two fields. These insights mirror catalytic processes, where disorder within a catalyst can lead to inefficient reaction mechanisms. Results obtained from our proof-of-principle implementation make the case for kick-starting more concentrated efforts in harnessing existing quantum computational tools for computationally probing complex dynamical behaviour arising in quantum matter. Our aim is to leverage tools from quantum information processing to bring about a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics and structure of glassy systems, ultimately informing the development of novel materials and technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Reversing Unknown Unitary Evolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversing an unknown quantum evolution is of central importance to quantum information processing and fundamental physics, yet it remains a formidable challenge as conventional methods necessitate an infinite number of queries to fully characterize the quantum process. Here we introduce the Quantum Unitary Reversal Algorithm (QURA), a deterministic and exact approach to universally reverse arbitrary unknown unitary transformations using $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ calls of the unitary, where $d$ is the system dimension. Our quantum algorithm resolves a fundamental problem of time-reversal simulations for closed quantum systems by confirming the feasibility of reversing any unitary evolution without knowing the exact process. The algorithm also provides the construction of a key oracle for unitary inversion in many quantum algorithm frameworks, such as quantum singular value transformation. It notably reveals a sharp boundary between the quantum and classical computing realms and unveils a quadratic quantum advantage in computational complexity for this foundational task.</description>

Abstract: Achieving densely connected hardware graphs is a challenge for most quantum computing platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for quantum annealers to realize effective Ising Hamiltonians of arbitrary connectivity. Our proposal consists on a resource-efficient configuration based on a hardware graph where physical qubits are connected to at most other 3 and containing exclusively 2-local interactions. We derive this configuration based on chains of qubits encoding logical variables by describing the problem graph in terms of triangles. We thus present a promising new route to scale up devices dedicated to classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

Abstract: This article shows a proof of concept regarding the feasibility of ab initio molecular simulation, wherein the wavefunctions and the positions of nuclei are simultaneously determined by the quantum algorithm, as is realized by the so-called Car-Parrinello method by classical computing. The approach used in this article is of a hybrid style, which shall be realized by future fault-tolerant quantum computer. First, the basic equations are approximated by polynomials. Second, those polynomials are transformed to a specific form, wherein all variables (representing the wavefunctions and the atomic coordinates) are given by the transformations acting on a linear space of monomials with finite dimension, and the unknown variables could be determined as the eigenvalues of those transformation matrices. Third, the eigenvalues are determined by quantum phase estimation. Following these three steps, namely, symbolic, numeric, and quantum steps, we can determine the optimized electronic and atomic structures of molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconducting qubits, suppression of spontaneous emission is essential to achieve fast dispersive measurement and reset without sacrificing qubit lifetime. We show that resonator-mediated decay of the qubit mode to the feedline can be suppressed using destructive interference, where the readout resonator is coupled to the feedline at two points. This "interferometric Purcell filter" does not require dedicated filter components or impedance mismatch in the feedline, making it suitable for applications such as all-pass readout. We design and fabricate a device with the proposed scheme and demonstrate suppression of resonator-mediated decay that exceeds 2 orders of magnitude over a bandwidth of 400 MHz for a resonator linewidth of 13.8 MHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying use cases with superconducting circuits not critically affected by the inherent noise is a pertinent challenge. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrable effects in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling the system's qubits to ancillary ones that are periodically reset. We compare the digital reset protocol to the usual Lindblad continuous-time evolution by considering non-interacting integrable systems dynamics, which can be analyzed using scattering between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles caused by the dissipation. If not dominant, the inherent noise would cause extra scattering but would not critically change the physics. A corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of stabilizing exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Addition of photons to coherent states is shown to produce effects that display remarkable similarities with cubic phase shifts acting on the vacuum state, with fidelities in excess of 90 percent. The strength of the cubic interaction is found to vary inversely with the displacement of the coherent state and the strongest interactions were one order of magnitude greater than previous observations. The interaction is non-perturbative.</description>

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone for a wide range of scientific endeavours, their solutions weaving through the core of diverse fields such as structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and financial modelling. PDEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their the intricate nature, and finding solutions to PDEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving PDEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of PDEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known PDEs are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial value and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic approach to treat open quantum systems strongly coupled to multiple environments via noncommuting system operators, a prime example is a qubit concurrently coupled to both decoherring and dissipative baths. Our approach, which accommodates strong system-bath couplings, generalizes the recently developed reaction-coordinate polaron transform method [PRX Quantum ${\bf 4}$, 020307 (2023)] to handle couplings to baths via noncommuting system operators. This approach creates an effective Hamiltonian that reveals the cooperative effect of the baths on the system. For a spin impurity coupled to both dissipative and decoherring environments, the effective Hamiltonian predicts the suppression of relaxation by decoherence -- a phenomenon previously observed in simulations but lacking a theoretical foundation. We also apply the method to an ensemble of spins coupled to local baths through noncommuting operators, demonstrating the engineering of the Kitaev XY spin chain interaction. Noncommutativity is a feature of quantum systems; future prospects of our approach include the study of thermal machines that leverage such genuine quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum repeaters have promised efficient scaling of quantum networks for over two decades. Despite numerous platforms proclaiming functional repeaters, the realization of large-scale networks remains elusive, indicating that the resources required to do so were thus far underestimated. %RR0209 Here, we investigate the dependence of resource scaling of networks on realistic experimental errors. Using a nested repeater protocol based on the purification protocol by Bennett et al., we provide an analytical approximation of the polynomial degree of the resources consumed by entanglement routing. Our error model predicts substantially stricter thresholds for efficient network operation than previously suggested, requiring two-qubit gate errors below 1.3\% for resource scaling with polynomial degree below 10. The analytical model presented here provides insight into the reason why previous experimental implementations of quantum repeaters failed to scale efficiently and inform the development of truly scalable systems, highlighting the need for high-fidelity local two-qubit gates. We employ our analytical approximation of the scaling exponent as a figure of merit to compare different platforms and find that trapped ions and color centers in diamond currently provide the best route towards large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>A new general quantum state verification protocol by the classical shadow method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying whether a quantum device produces a specific state is a fundamental task in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, designing an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state often requires intricate customization. Recently, Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. introduced a novel approach called the shadow overlap protocol in arXiv:2404.07281v1, which leverages classical shadows to efficiently verify multiple types of states simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new verification protocol that integrates key ideas from both the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. To achieve this, we first reformulate the shadow overlap protocol using the language of hypothesis testing, which also underpins the conventional framework, and then analyze the similarities and differences between them. Our approach enhances the capabilities of the shadow overlap protocol while addressing some of its limitations, leading to improved sample complexity and a more natural treatment of states with specific structures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by applying it to GHZ states and stabilizer states.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H$ from black-box queries to its time evolution $e^{-\mathrm{i} H t}$. Prior proposals for solving this task either impose some assumptions on $H$, such as its interaction structure or locality, or otherwise use an exponential amount of computational postprocessing. In this paper, we present algorithms to learn any $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, which do not need to know the Hamiltonian terms in advance, nor are they restricted to local interactions. Our algorithms are efficient as long as the number of terms $m$ is polynomially bounded in the system size $n$. We consider two models of control over the time evolution:~the first has access to time reversal ($t &lt; 0$), enabling an algorithm that outputs an $\epsilon$-accurate classical description of $H$ after querying its dynamics for a total of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(m/\epsilon)$ evolution time. The second access model is more conventional, allowing only forward-time evolutions;~our algorithm requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\|H\|^3/\epsilon^4)$ evolution time in this setting. Central to our results is the recently introduced concept of a pseudo-Choi state of $H$. We extend the utility of this learning resource by showing how to use it to learn the Fourier spectrum of $H$, how to achieve nearly Heisenberg-limited scaling with it, and how to prepare it even under our more restricted access models.</description>

      <title>Efficient explicit circuit for quantum state preparation of piece-wise continuous functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently uploading data into quantum states is essential for many quantum algorithms to achieve advantage across various applications. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a method to upload a polynomial function $f(x)$ on the interval $x \in (a, b)$ into a pure quantum state consisting of qubits, where a discretized $f(x)$ is the amplitude of this state. The preparation cost has $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ scaling in the number of qubits $n$ and linear scaling with the degree of the polynomial $Q$. This efficiency allows the preparation of states whose amplitudes correspond to high-degree polynomials, enabling the approximation of almost any continuous function. We introduce an explicit algorithm for uploading such functions using four real polynomials that meet specific parity and boundedness conditions. We also generalize this approach to piece-wise polynomial functions, with the algorithm scaling linearly with the number of piecewise parts. Our method achieves efficient quantum circuit implementation and we present detailed gate counting and resource analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-time weak measurement protocol for ergotropy protection in open quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are emerging as highly efficient energy storage devices that can exceed classical performance limits. Although there have been significant advancements in controlling these systems, challenges remain in stabilizing stored energy and minimizing losses due to inevitable environmental interaction. In this paper, we propose a protocol that employs selective weak measurements to protect quantum states from such influence and mitigate battery discharging, that is feasible in state-of-the-art technologies. We establish thermodynamic constraints that allow this method to be implemented without disrupting the overall energy and ergotropy balance of the system, i.e., with no extra net recharging. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately chosen measurement intensity can reduce unwanted discharging effects, thereby preserving ergotropy and improving the stability of quantum batteries. We illustrate the protocol with single and two-qubit systems and establish the generalization for $N$-cell batteries. Additionally, we explore how weak measurements influence the coherent and incoherent components of ergotropy, providing new insights into the practical application of quantum coherence in energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence PSHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning PSHE. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>

      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology matures, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures - in particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessarily support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization, are typically not designed for qubit links of significantly varying latency or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a hierarchical parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum systems, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains a $9.3\%$ average increase in circuit fidelity (up to $49.99\%$). Additionally, owing to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves $3.27\times$ faster compilation on average (up to $6.74\times$) over a chiplet-unaware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <title>A graph-theoretic approach to chaos and complexity in quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has recently been considerable interest in studying quantum systems via dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) -- Lie algebras generated by the terms which appear in the Hamiltonian of the system. However, there are some important properties that are revealed only at a finer level of granularity than the DLA. In this work we explore, via the commutator graph, average notions of scrambling, chaos and complexity over ensembles of systems with DLAs that possess a basis consisting of Pauli strings. Unlike DLAs, commutator graphs are sensitive to short-time dynamics, and therefore constitute a finer probe to various characteristics of the corresponding ensemble. We link graph-theoretic properties of the commutator graph to the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), the frame potential, the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian of the system, and the Krylov complexity of operators evolving under the dynamics. For example, we reduce the calculation of average OTOCs to a counting problem on the graph; separately, we connect the Krylov complexity of an operator to the module structure of the adjoint action of the DLA on the space of operators in which it resides, and prove that its average over the ensemble is lower bounded by the average shortest path length between the initial operator and the other operators in the commutator graph.</description>

      <title>Local Unitary Equivalence of Tripartite Quantum States In Terms of Trace Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a modified version of the proof given Jing-Yang-Zhao's paper "Local Unitary Equivalence of Quantum States and Simultaneous Orthogonal Equivalence," which established the correspondence between local unitary (LU) equivalence and simultaneous orthogonal equivalence of bipartite quantum states. Our modified proof utilizes a hypermatrix algebra framework, and with this framework we are able to generalize this correspondence to tripartite quantum states. Finally, we apply a generalization of Specht's criterion proved in Futorny-Horn-Sergeichuk' paper "Specht's Criterion for Systems of Linear Mappings" to \textit{essentially} reduce the problem of local unitary equivalence of tripartite quantum states to checking trace identities and a few other LU invariants. We also note that all of these results can be extended to arbitrary multipartite quantum states, however there are some practical limitations.</description>

      <title>An Accurate and Efficient Analytic Model of Fidelity Under Depolarizing Noise Oriented to Large Scale Quantum System Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fidelity is one of the most valuable and commonly used metrics for assessing the performance of quantum circuits on error-prone quantum processors. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate circuit fidelity without executing it on quantum hardware, but they often face limitations in scalability or accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict the fidelity of quantum circuits under depolarizing noise. Building on theoretical results, we propose an efficient fidelity estimation algorithm based on device calibration data. The method is thoroughly validated through simulation and execution on real hardware, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, with enhancements in prediction $R^2$ ranging from 4.96\% to 213.54\%.. The proposed approach provides a scalable and practical tool for benchmarking quantum hardware, comparing quantum software techniques such as compilation methods, obtaining computation bounds for quantum systems, and guiding hardware design decisions, making it a critical resource for developing and evaluating quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>A Superconducting Qubit-Resonator Quantum Processor with Effective All-to-All Connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a superconducting quantum processor architecture that uses a transmission-line resonator to implement effective all-to-all connectivity between six transmon qubits. This architecture can be used as a test-bed for algorithms that benefit from high connectivity. We show that the central resonator can be used as a computational element, which offers the flexibility to encode a qubit for quantum computation or to utilize its bosonic modes which further enables quantum simulation of bosonic systems. To operate the quantum processing unit (QPU), we develop and benchmark the qubit-resonator conditional Z gate and the qubit-resonator MOVE operation. The latter allows for transferring a quantum state between one of the peripheral qubits and the computational resonator. We benchmark the QPU performance and achieve a genuinely multi-qubit entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state over all six qubits with a readout-error mitigated fidelity of $0.86$.</description>

      <title>An entanglement protocol to measure atomic parity violation at sub 0.1% precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scheme to measure atomic parity violation (APV) in barium ions at &lt;0.1% precision. The scheme is based on using multi-ion entangled states to common-mode reject parity-conserving systematic shifts and selectively detect a parity-violating vector light shift. This measurement protocol eliminates the need to suppress a leading systematic by 11 orders of magnitude, as is required in the single-ion measurement scheme [N. Fortson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2383 (1993)]. Furthermore, the protocol can be combined with the use of integrated photonic waveguides in an architecture that is scalable to large ion numbers, with a proportional increase in measurement precision.</description>

      <title>An improved quantum algorithm for linear autonomous differential equations via Pad\'e approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Pad\'e approximation. For linear autonomous ODEs, the discretized solution can be represented by a product of matrix exponentials. The proposed algorithm approximates the matrix exponential by the diagonal Pad\'e approximation, which is then encoded into a large, block-sparse linear system and solved via quantum linear system algorithms (QLSA). The detailed quantum circuit is given based on quantum oracle access to the matrix, the inhomogeneous term, and the initial state. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Compared to the method based on Taylor approximation, which approximates the matrix exponential using a $k$-th order Taylor series, the proposed algorithm improves the approximation order $k$ from two perspectives: 1) the explicit complexity dependency on $k$ is improved, and 2) a smaller $k$ suffices for the same precision. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm comparing to other related algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>SCOOP: A Quantum-Computing Framework for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the ultimate goal of solving computationally intractable problems is to find a provably optimal solutions, practical constraints of real-world scenarios often necessitate focusing on efficiently obtaining high-quality, near-optimal solutions. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical approach for tackling these challenging problems that are encoded using quadratic and higher-order unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBO and HUBO). We present SCOOP, a novel QAOA-based framework for solving constrained optimization problems. SCOOP transforms a constrained problem into an unconstrained counterpart, forming SCOOP problem twins. The QAOA quantum algorithm operates on the unconstrained twin to identify potential optimal and near-optimal solutions. Effective classical post-processing reduces the solution set to the constrained problem space. Our SCOOP approach is solution-enhanced, objective-function-compatible, and scalable. We demonstrate the framework on three NP-hard problems, Minimum Dominating Set, Minimum Maximal Matching, and Minimum Set Cover appearing in practical application domains such as resource allocation, communication networks, and machine learning. We validate SCOOP's feasibility and effectiveness on Xanadu PennyLane simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to reduce readout-induced faults, applicable in settings like quantum error correction with repeated measurement cycles. The method consists of an adaptive readout sequence conditioned on each check qubit's readout result from the previous cycle. For readout errors, correlated preparation errors and measurement-induced leakage that are stronger in a particular qubit state, this feedforward protocol can suppress the physical qubit errors. Focusing on a simple realization of conditionally flipping (by an X gate) the state of check qubits before their measurement, we investigate the effect of such state-dependent errors using simulations in the setup of a low-density parity check code. We show that the suggested protocol can reduce both logical errors and decoding time, two important aspects of fault-tolerant quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeaters enhanced by vacuum beam guides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fast microwave-driven two-qubit gates between fluxonium qubits with a transmon coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two qubit gates constitute fundamental building blocks in the realization of large-scale quantum devices. Using superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates have previously been implemented in different ways with each method aiming to maximize gate fidelity. Another important goal of a new gate scheme is to minimize the complexity of gate calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a high-fidelity two-qubit gate between two fluxonium qubits enabled by an intermediate capacitively coupled transmon. The coupling strengths between the qubits and the coupler are designed to minimize residual crosstalk while still allowing for fast gate operations. The gate is based on frequency selectively exciting the coupler using a microwave drive to complete a 2$\pi$ rotation, conditional on the state of the fluxonium qubits. When successful, this drive scheme implements a conditional phase gate. Using analytically derived pulse shapes, we minimize unwanted excitations of the coupler and obtain gate errors of $10^{-2}$ for gate times below 60~ns. At longer durations, our gate is limited by relaxation of the coupler. Our results show how carefully designed control pulses can speed up frequency selective entangling gates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of a few spin $1/2$ interacting fermions trapped in an harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.10886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the properties of a few interacting spin $1/2$ fermions trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The interaction is assumed to be well represented by a contact delta potential. Numerical results obtained by means of direct diagonalization techniques are combined with analytical expressions for both the non-interacting and strongly interacting regime. The $N=2$ case is used to benchmark our numerical techniques with the known exact solution of the problem. After a detailed description of the numerical methods, in a tutorial-like manner, we present the static properties of the system for $N=2, 3, 4$ and 5 particles, e.g. low-energy spectrum, one-body density matrix, ground-state densities. Then, we consider dynamical properties of the system exploring first the excitation of the breathing mode, using the dynamical structure function and corresponding sum-rules, and then a sudden quench of the interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Prospects of phase-adaptive cooling of levitated magnetic particles in a hollow-core photonic-crystal fibre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the feasibility of cooling of classical motion of a micro- to nano-sized magnetic particle, levitated inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The cooling action is implemented by means of controlling the relative phase between counter-propagating fiber guided waves. Direct imaging of the particle's position allows dynamic phase adjustments that produce a Stokes-type cooling force. We provide estimates of cooling efficiency and final achievable temperature, taking into account thermal and detection noise sources. Our results bring forward an important step towards using trapped micro-magnets in sensing, testing the fundamental physics and preparing the quantum states of magnetization.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid thermal machine based on a single closed quantum Hall edge channel forming a quantum dot. It is tunneling coupled with two quantum Hall states at $\nu = 2$ in contact with reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials. One of these edge states is also driven out-of-equilibrium by means of a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses. This device allows to explore various possible working regimes including the engine, the heat pump and the refrigerator configuration. Regions where two regimes coexist can also be identified. Moreover, the proposed set-up exhibits robustness and in some parameter regions also slightly enhanced performance in the presence of electron-electron interactions.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained Bootstrap of Quantum Many-body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Photodynamics and Performance Metrics in Cavity-Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, Purcell-enhanced emission can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for cavity-coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs. We apply this model to evaluate device performance and explore how photonic environments can be engineered for triplet harvesting, enhanced emission, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Customized, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser smoothing. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from a spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser smoothing processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open frontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena connecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the interplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable and compact form.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>
