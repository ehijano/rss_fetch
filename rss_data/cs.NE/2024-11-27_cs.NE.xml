      <title>Recurrent Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture with Recurrent Forward Propagation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional computer vision models rely on very deep, feedforward networks processing whole images and trained offline with extensive labeled data. In contrast, biological vision relies on comparatively shallow, recurrent networks that analyze sequences of fixated image patches, learning continuously in real-time without explicit supervision. This work introduces a vision network inspired by these biological principles. Specifically, it leverages a joint embedding predictive architecture incorporating recurrent gated circuits. The network learns by predicting the representation of the next image patch (fixation) based on the sequence of past fixations, a form of self-supervised learning. We show mathematical and empirically that the training algorithm avoids the problem of representational collapse. We also introduce \emph{Recurrent-Forward Propagation}, a learning algorithm that avoids biologically unrealistic backpropagation through time or memory-inefficient real-time recurrent learning. We show mathematically that the algorithm implements exact gradient descent for a large class of recurrent architectures, and confirm empirically that it learns efficiently. This paper focuses on these theoretical innovations and leaves empirical evaluation of performance in downstream tasks, and analysis of representational similarity with biological vision for future work.</description>

      <title>TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</description>

      <title>Understanding trade-offs in classifier bias with quality-diversity optimization: an application to talent management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness,the impartial treatment towards individuals or groups regardless of their inherent or acquired characteristics [20], is a critical challenge for the successful implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in multiple fields like finances, human capital, and housing. A major struggle for the development of fair AI models lies in the bias implicit in the data available to train such models. Filtering or sampling the dataset before training can help ameliorate model bias but can also reduce model performance and the bias impact can be opaque. In this paper, we propose a method for visualizing the biases inherent in a dataset and understanding the potential trade-offs between fairness and accuracy. Our method builds on quality-diversity optimization, in particular Covariance Matrix Adaptation Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites). Our method provides a visual representation of bias in models, allows users to identify models within a minimal threshold of fairness, and determines the trade-off between fairness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-aware Evolutionary Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural architecture search (GNAS) can customize high-performance graph neural network architectures for specific graph tasks or datasets. However, existing GNAS methods begin searching for architectures from a zero-knowledge state, ignoring the prior knowledge that may improve the search efficiency. The available knowledge base (e.g. NAS-Bench-Graph) contains many rich architectures and their multiple performance metrics, such as the accuracy (#Acc) and number of parameters (#Params). This study proposes exploiting such prior knowledge to accelerate the multi-objective evolutionary search on a new graph dataset, named knowledge-aware evolutionary GNAS (KEGNAS). KEGNAS employs the knowledge base to train a knowledge model and a deep multi-output Gaussian process (DMOGP) in one go, which generates and evaluates transfer architectures in only a few GPU seconds. The knowledge model first establishes a dataset-to-architecture mapping, which can quickly generate candidate transfer architectures for a new dataset. Subsequently, the DMOGP with architecture and dataset encodings is designed to predict multiple performance metrics for candidate transfer architectures on the new dataset. According to the predicted metrics, non-dominated candidate transfer architectures are selected to warm-start the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the #Acc and #Params on a new dataset. Empirical studies on NAS-Bench-Graph and five real-world datasets show that KEGNAS swiftly generates top-performance architectures, achieving 4.27% higher accuracy than advanced evolutionary baselines and 11.54% higher accuracy than advanced differentiable baselines. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate that the use of prior knowledge significantly improves the search performance.</description>

      <title>Noise Adaptor: Enhancing Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks through Noise-Injected Low-Bit ANN Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Noise Adaptor, a novel method for constructing competitive low-latency spiking neural networks (SNNs) by converting noise-injected, low-bit artificial neural networks (ANNs). This approach builds on existing ANN-to-SNN conversion techniques but offers several key improvements: (1) By injecting noise during quantized ANN training, Noise Adaptor better accounts for the dynamic differences between ANNs and SNNs, significantly enhancing SNN accuracy. (2) Unlike previous methods, Noise Adaptor does not require the application of run-time noise correction techniques in SNNs, thereby avoiding modifications to the spiking neuron model and control flow during inference. (3) Our method extends the capability of handling deeper architectures, achieving successful conversions of activation-quantized ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 to SNNs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, achieving competitive performance. The code will be made available as open-source.</description>

      <title>SpikeAtConv: An Integrated Spiking-Convolutional Attention Architecture for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Vision Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired alternative to conventional artificial neural networks, with potential advantages in power efficiency due to their event-driven computation. Despite their promise, SNNs have yet to achieve competitive performance on complex visual tasks, such as image classification. This study introduces a novel SNN architecture designed to enhance computational efficacy and task accuracy. The architecture features optimized pulse modules that facilitate the processing of spatio-temporal patterns in visual data, aiming to reconcile the computational demands of high-level vision tasks with the energy-efficient processing of SNNs. Our evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate that the proposed architecture narrows the performance gap with traditional neural networks, providing insights into the design of more efficient and capable neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning in Chemical Engineering: A Tutorial on a Framework for Privacy-Preserving Collaboration Across Distributed Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach that has gained attention for its potential to enable collaborative model training across clients while protecting data privacy, making it an attractive solution for the chemical industry. This work aims to provide the chemical engineering community with an accessible introduction to the discipline. Supported by a hands-on tutorial and a comprehensive collection of examples, it explores the application of FL in tasks such as manufacturing optimization, multimodal data integration, and drug discovery while addressing the unique challenges of protecting proprietary information and managing distributed datasets. The tutorial was built using key frameworks such as $\texttt{Flower}$ and $\texttt{TensorFlow Federated}$ and was designed to provide chemical engineers with the right tools to adopt FL in their specific needs. We compare the performance of FL against centralized learning across three different datasets relevant to chemical engineering applications, demonstrating that FL will often maintain or improve classification performance, particularly for complex and heterogeneous data. We conclude with an outlook on the open challenges in federated learning to be tackled and current approaches designed to remediate and improve this framework.</description>

      <title>Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</description>

      <title>Storing overlapping associative memories on latent manifolds in low-rank spiking networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory architectures such as the Hopfield network have long been important conceptual and theoretical models for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, translating these abstract models into spiking neural networks has been surprisingly difficult. Indeed, much previous work has been restricted to storing a small number of primarily non-overlapping memories in large networks, thereby limiting their scalability. Here, we revisit the associative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding spike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we show that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is situated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with dynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory problem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic manifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a direct correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several learning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with the number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall, this work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a geometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with implications for neuroscience and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Improving the Convergence Rates of Forward Gradient Descent with Repeated Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward gradient descent (FGD) has been proposed as a biologically more plausible alternative of gradient descent as it can be computed without backward pass. Considering the linear model with $d$ parameters, previous work has found that the prediction error of FGD is, however, by a factor $d$ slower than the prediction error of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper we show that by computing $\ell$ FGD steps based on each training sample, this suboptimality factor becomes $d/(\ell \wedge d)$ and thus the suboptimality of the rate disappears if $\ell \gtrsim d.$ We also show that FGD with repeated sampling can adapt to low-dimensional structure in the input distribution. The main mathematical challenge lies in controlling the dependencies arising from the repeated sampling process.</description>

      <title>Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101.</description>

      <title>Getting aligned on representational alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations of the world that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the similarity between the representations formed by these diverse systems? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? If so, then how can a system's representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most promising research areas in contemporary cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. In this Perspective, we survey the exciting recent developments in representational alignment research in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. Despite their overlapping interests, there is limited knowledge transfer between these fields, so work in one field ends up duplicated in another, and useful innovations are not shared effectively. To improve communication, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language for research on representational alignment, and map several streams of existing work across fields within our framework. We also lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that this paper will catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems.</description>
