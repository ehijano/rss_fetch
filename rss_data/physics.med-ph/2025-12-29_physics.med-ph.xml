      <title>Deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed optical sensor for point-of-care diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and accessible cardiac biomarker testing is essential for the timely diagnosis and risk assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), two interrelated conditions that frequently coexist and drive recurrent hospitalizations with high mortality. However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r &gt; 0.96 vs. reference assays). By combining high sensitivity, multiplexing, and automation in a compact and cost-effective optical sensor format, the dual-mode xVFA enables rapid and quantitative cardiovascular diagnostics at the point of care.</description>

      <title>Proton therapy range uncertainty reduction using vendor-agnostic tissue characterization on a virtual photon-counting CT head scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proposed virtual imaging simulators as an alternative approach to experimental validation of beam range uncertainty in complex patient geometry using a computational model of a human head and a photon-counting CT scanner. We validate the accuracy of stopping power ratio (SPR) calculations using a conventional stoichiometric calibration approach and a prototype software, TissueXplorer. A validated CT simulator (DukeSim) was used to generate photon-counting CT projections of a computational head model, which were reconstructed with an open-source toolbox (ASTRA). The dose of 2 Gy was delivered through protons in a single fraction to target two different cases of nasal and brain tumors with a single lateral beam angle. Ground truth treatment plan was made directly on the computational head model using clinical treatment planning software (RayStation). This plan was then recalculated on the corresponding CT images for which SPR values were estimated using both the conventional method and the prototype software TissueXplorer. The mean percentage difference in estimating the stopping power ratio with TissueXplorer in all head tissues inside the scanned volume was 0.28%. Stopping power ratios obtained with this method showed smaller dose distribution differences from the ground truth plan than the conventional stoichiometric calibration method on the computational head model. Virtual imaging offers an alternative approach to validation of the SPR prediction from CT imaging, as well as its effect on the dose distribution and thus downstream clinical outcomes. According to this simulation study, software solutions that utilize spectral information, such as TissueXplorer, hold promise for more accurate prediction of the stopping power ratio than the conventional stoichiometric approach.</description>

      <title>Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Enabling Ultra-Fast Cardiovascular Imaging Across Heterogeneous Clinical Environments with a Generalist Foundation Model and Multimodal Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides comprehensive and non-invasive insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis and underlying mechanisms. Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity. Together, our open-access MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM framework establish a scalable pathway toward high-throughput, high-quality, and clinically accessible cardiovascular imaging.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Network of Brain Dynamics: Hierarchy of Approximations to Quasi-critical Neural Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interacting branching model of neural network dynamics, incorporating key biological features such as inhibition with several types of inhibitory interactions. We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-criticality hypothesis in that it displays regions of maximal dynamical susceptibility and maximal mutual information predicated on the strength of the external stimuli. Directed percolation emerges as the universality class of the critical transition of the model, consistent with some previous experimental data and models. In the unstable phase, chaotic dynamics emerge, which may be linked to the occurrence of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains difficult to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both tension and elastic modulus in the lens capsule and underlying tissue. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. The mean shear moduli of anterior and posterior capsules were 630 kPa and 400 kPa, respectively, nearly 100-fold greater than that of the cortical tissues, where tensions were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension by 67 kPa, with a low uncertainty of only 2 kPa. This optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vision Mamba for MRI Super-Resolution via Hybrid Selective Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: High-resolution MRI is critical for diagnosis, but long acquisition times limit clinical use. Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p&lt;0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate MRI SR solution, delivering enhanced anatomical detail across datasets. Its low computational demand and state-of-the-art performance show strong potential for clinical translation.</description>
