      <title>Digital Twins and Civil Engineering Phases: Reorienting Adoption Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing, automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum, Building Information Modeling (BIM) are pervasively utilized in the planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this paper, we present a phase-based development of DT in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry. We commence by presenting succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service and establish a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the Internet of Things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil engineering projects and nudge researchers to think more holistically in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Reducing computational effort in topology optimization considering the deformation in additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating topology optimization and additive manufacturing (AM) technology can facilitate innovative product development. However, laser powder bed fusion, which is the predominant method in metal AM, can lead to issues such as residual stress and deformation. Recently, topology optimization methods considering these stresses and deformations have been proposed; however, they suffer from challenges caused by an increased computational cost. In this study, we propose a method for reducing computational cost in topology optimization considering the deformation in AM. An inherent strain method-based analytical model is presented for simulating the residual stress and deformation in the AM process. Subsequently, a constraint condition to suppress the deformation is formulated, and a method to reduce the computational cost of the adjoint analysis in deriving sensitivity is proposed. The minimum mean compliance problem considering AM deformation and self-support constraints can then be incorporated into the level set-based topology optimization framework. Finally, numerical examples are presented for validating the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization method.</description>

      <title>A dataset of over one thousand computed tomography scans of battery cells</title>

Abstract: Battery technology is increasingly important for global electrification efforts. However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Training Method for Modeling Constrained Systems With Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world systems are often formulated as constrained optimization problems. Techniques to incorporate constraints into Neural Networks (NN), such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), have been used. However, these introduce hyperparameters that require manual tuning through trial and error, raising doubts about the successful incorporation of constraints into the generated model. This paper describes in detail the two-stage training method for Neural ODEs, a simple, effective, and penalty parameter-free approach to model constrained systems. In this approach the constrained optimization problem is rewritten as two unconstrained sub-problems that are solved in two stages. The first stage aims at finding feasible NN parameters by minimizing a measure of constraints violation. The second stage aims to find the optimal NN parameters by minimizing the loss function while keeping inside the feasible region. We experimentally demonstrate that our method produces models that satisfy the constraints and also improves their predictive performance. Thus, ensuring compliance with critical system properties and also contributing to reducing data quantity requirements. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method improves the convergence to an optimal solution and improves the explainability of Neural ODE models. Our proposed two-stage training method can be used with any NN architectures.</description>

      <title>Neural Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs) are essential tools for modelling complex systems in science and engineering. They extend the traditional concepts of differentiation and integration to non-integer orders, enabling a more precise representation of processes characterised by non-local and memory-dependent behaviours.
  This property is useful in systems where variables do not respond to changes instantaneously, but instead exhibit a strong memory of past interactions.
  Having this in mind, and drawing inspiration from Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose the Neural FDE, a novel deep neural network architecture that adjusts a FDE to the dynamics of data.
  This work provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical method employed in Neural FDEs and the Neural FDE architecture. The numerical outcomes suggest that, despite being more computationally demanding, the Neural FDE may outperform the Neural ODE in modelling systems with memory or dependencies on past states, and it can effectively be applied to learn more intricate dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Hydropower Management Approach for Downstream Ecosystem Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydropower plants play a pivotal role in advancing clean and sustainable energy production, contributing significantly to the global transition towards renewable energy sources. However, hydropower plants are currently perceived both positively as sources of renewable energy and negatively as disruptors of ecosystems. In this work, we highlight the overlooked potential of using hydropower plant as protectors of ecosystems by using adaptive ecological discharges. To advocate for this perspective, we propose using a neural network to predict the minimum ecological discharge value at each desired time. Additionally, we present a novel framework that seamlessly integrates it into hydropower management software, taking advantage of the well-established approach of using traditional constrained optimisation algorithms. This novel approach not only protects the ecosystems from climate change but also contributes to potentially increase the electricity production.</description>

      <title>DiffDA: a Diffusion model for weather-scale Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of initial conditions via accurate data assimilation is crucial for weather forecasting and climate modeling. We propose DiffDA as a denoising diffusion model capable of assimilating atmospheric variables using predicted states and sparse observations. Acknowledging the similarity between a weather forecast model and a denoising diffusion model dedicated to weather applications, we adapt the pretrained GraphCast neural network as the backbone of the diffusion model. Through experiments based on simulated observations from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, our method can produce assimilated global atmospheric data consistent with observations at 0.25 deg (~30km) resolution globally. This marks the highest resolution achieved by ML data assimilation models. The experiments also show that the initial conditions assimilated from sparse observations (less than 0.77% of gridded data) and 48-hour forecast can be used for forecast models with a loss of lead time of at most 24 hours compared to initial conditions from state-of-the-art data assimilation in ERA5. This enables the application of the method to real-world applications, such as creating reanalysis datasets with autoregressive data assimilation.</description>

      <title>An electromechanics-driven fluid dynamics model for the simulation of the whole human heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multiphysics and geometric multiscale computational model, suitable to describe the hemodynamics of the whole human heart, driven by a four-chamber electromechanical model. We first present a study on the calibration of the biophysically detailed RDQ20 activation model (Regazzoni et al., 2020) that is able to reproduce the physiological range of hemodynamic biomarkers. Then, we demonstrate that the ability of the force generation model to reproduce certain microscale mechanisms, such as the dependence of force on fiber shortening velocity, is crucial to capture the overall physiological mechanical and fluid dynamics macroscale behavior. This motivates the need for using multiscale models with high biophysical fidelity, even when the outputs of interest are relative to the macroscale. We show that the use of a high-fidelity electromechanical model, combined with a detailed calibration process, allows us to achieve remarkable biophysical fidelity in terms of both mechanical and hemodynamic quantities. Indeed, our electromechanical-driven CFD simulations - carried out on an anatomically accurate geometry of the whole heart - provide results that match the cardiac physiology both qualitatively (in terms of flow patterns) and quantitatively (when comparing in silico results with biomarkers acquired in vivo). We consider the pathological case of left bundle branch block, and we investigate the consequences that an electrical abnormality has on cardiac hemodynamics thanks to our multiphysics integrated model. The computational model that we propose can faithfully predict a delay and an increasing wall shear stress in the left ventricle in the pathological condition. The interaction of different physical processes in an integrated framework allows us to faithfully describe and model this pathology, by capturing and reproducing the intrinsic multiphysics nature of the human heart.</description>
