      <title>Discrete isoperimetric inequalities on the strong products of paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G=(V,\ E)$ and a nonempty set $S\subseteq V$, the \emph{vertex boundary} of $S$, denoted by $\partial_G(S)$, is defined to be the set of vertices that are not in $S$ but are adjacent to some vertex in $S$. In this paper, we focus on the strong products of paths, and study when the size of the vertex boundary of a set of $k$ vertices is minimized. We give a conjecture regarding the $n$-dimensional strong product of infinite paths, and prove it for the $2$-dimensional case. Also, we determine when $|\partial_G(S)|$ is minimized if $G$ is a $2$-dimensional strong product of finite paths.</description>

      <title>A framework for the generalised Erd\H{o}s-Rothschild problem and a resolution of the dichromatic triangle case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Rothschild problem from 1974 asks for the maximum number of $s$-edge colourings in an $n$-vertex graph which avoid a monochromatic copy of $K_k$, given positive integers $n,s,k$. In this paper, we systematically study the generalisation of this problem to a given forbidden family of colourings of $K_k$. This problem typically exhibits a dichotomy whereby for some values of $s$, the extremal graph is the `trivial' one, namely the Tur\'an graph on $k-1$ parts, with no copies of $K_k$; while for others, this graph is no longer extremal and determining the extremal graph becomes much harder.
  We generalise a framework developed for the monochromatic Erd\H{o}s-Rothschild problem to the general setting and work in this framework to obtain our main results, which concern two specific forbidden families: triangles with exactly two colours, and improperly coloured cliques. We essentially solve these problems fully for all integers $s \geq 2$ and large $n$. In both cases we obtain an infinite family of structures which are extremal for some $s$, which are the first results of this kind.
  A consequence of our results is that for every non-monochromatic colour pattern, every extremal graph is complete partite. Our work extends work of Hoppen, Lefmann and Schmidt and of Benevides, Hoppen and Sampaio.</description>

      <title>Fixed perimeter analogues of some partition results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler's partition identity states that the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. Strikingly, Straub proved in 2016 that this identity also holds when counting partitions of any size with largest hook (perimeter) $n$. This has inspired further investigation of partition identities and inequalities in the fixed perimeter setting. Here, we explore fixed perimeter analogues of some well-known partition results inspired by Euler's partition identity.</description>

      <title>The planar projectivity of PG(2, $q^3$) of order 3 under field reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi$ be a collineation of $\mathrm{PG}\left(2, q^{3}\right)$ of order 3 which fixes a plane of order $q$ pointwise. The points of $\mathrm{PG}\left(2, q^{3}\right)$ can be partitioned into three types with respect to orbits of $\phi$ : fixed points; points $P$ with $P, P^{\phi}, P^{\phi^{2}}$ distinct and collinear; and points $P$ with $P, P^{\phi}, P^{\phi^{2}}$ not collinear. Under field reduction, the collineation $\phi$ corresponds to a projectivity $\sigma$ of $\operatorname{PG}(8, q)$ of order 3 . With respect to the field reduction and the orbits of $\sigma$, the points of $\mathrm{PG}(8, q)$ can be partitioned into six types. This article looks at the projectivity $\sigma$ in detail, and classifies and counts the fixed points, fixed lines and fixed planes. The motivation is to give a description of the lines of the Figueroa projective plane in the $\mathrm{PG}(8, q)$ field reduction setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-regular graph on $v$ vertices is a {\em divisible design graph} if there exist integers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,m,n$ such that the vertex set can be partitioned into $m$ classes of size $n$ and any two different vertices from the same class have $\lambda_1$ common neighbours, and any two vertices from different classes have $\lambda_2$ common neighbours. In this paper, a new construction that produces divisible design graphs is provided.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of mixed Ramsey numbers t(3,n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices $X\subseteq V$ in a simple graph $G(V,E)$ is irredundant if each vertex $x\in X$ is either isolated in the induced subgraph $G[X]$ or else has a private neighbor $y\in V\setminus X$ that is adjacent to $x$ and to no other vertex of $X$. The \emph{mixed Ramsey number} $t(m,n)$ is the smallest $N$ for which every red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ has an $m$-element irredundant set in the blue subgraph or an $n$-element independent set in the red subgraph. In this paper, we determine $t(3,n)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor of order $\log{n}$ by showing that $t(3,n)=O\left(n^{5/4}/{\log^{1/4}{n}}\right)$. Using this result, we verify the special case of a conjecture proposed by Chen, Hattingh, and Rousseau, that is, $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}t(4,n)/r(4,n)=0$.</description>

      <title>On list extensions of the majority edge colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate possible list extensions of generalised majority edge colourings of graphs and provide several results concerning these. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a list assignment $L:E\to 2^C$ and some level of majority tolerance $\alpha\in(0,1)$, an $\alpha$-majority $L$-colouring of $G$ is a colouring $\omega:E\to C$ from the given lists such that for every $v\in V$ and each $c\in C$, the number of edges coloured $c$ which are incident with $v$ does not exceed $\alpha\cdot d(v)$. We present a simple argument implying that for every integer $k\geq 2$, each graph with minimum degree $\delta\geq 2k^2-2k$ admits a $1/k$-majority $L$-colouring from any assignment of lists of size $k+1$. This almost matches the best result in a non-list setting and solves a conjecture posed for the basic majority edge colourings, i.e. for $k=2$, from lists. We further discuss restrictions which permit obtaining corresponding results in a more general setting, i.e. for diversified $\alpha=\alpha(c)$ majority tolerances for distinct colours $c\in C$. Consider a list assignment $L:E\to 2^C$ with $\sum_{c\in L(e)}\alpha(c)\geq 1+\varepsilon$ for each edge $e$, and suppose that $\alpha(c)\geq a$ for every $c$ or $|L(e)|\leq\ell$ for all edges $e$, where $a\in(0,1)$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $\ell\in\mathbb{N}$ are any given constants. Then we in particular show that there exists an $\alpha$-majority $L$-colouring of $G$ from any such list assignment, provided that $\delta(G)=\Omega(a^{-1}\varepsilon^{-2}\ln(a\varepsilon)^{-1})$ or $\delta=\Omega(\ell^2\varepsilon^{-2})$, respectively. We also strengthen these bounds within a setting where each edge is associated to a list of colours with a fixed vector of majority tolerances, applicable also in a general non-list case.</description>

Abstract: We are interested to bound from below the number of distinct dot products determined by a finite set of points $P$ in the Euclidean plane. In this paper, we build on the work of B. Hanson, O. Roche-Newton, and S. Senger, to obtain the improved lower bound \[|\{p\cdot q : p,q\in P\}|\gtrsim |P|^{\frac2 3 + \frac{7}{1425}}.\]</description>

      <title>Determining the vertex stabilizers of 4-valent half-arc-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a group is a $4$-HAT-stabilizer if it is the vertex stabilizer of some connected $4$-valent half-arc-transitive graph. In 2001, Maru\v{s}i\v{c} and Nedela proved that every $4$-HAT-stabilizer must be a concentric group. However, over the past two decades, only a very small proportion of concentric groups have been shown to be $4$-HAT-stabilizers. This paper develops a theory that provides a general framework for determining whether a concentric group is a $4$-HAT-stabilizer. With this approach, we significantly extend the known list of $4$-HAT-stabilizers. As a corollary, we confirm that $\mathcal{H}_7\times C_2^{m-7}$ are $4$-HAT-stabilizers for $m\geq 7$, achieving the goal of a conjecture posed by Spiga and Xia.</description>

      <title>The geometry of zonotopal algebras I: cohomology of graphical configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras of vector arrangements are combinatorially-defined algebras with connections to approximation theory, introduced by Holtz and Ron and independently by Ardila and Postnikov. We show that the internal zonotopal algebra of a cographical vector arrangement is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a certain configuration space introduced by Moseley, Proudfoot, and Young. We also study an integral form of this algebra, which in the cographical case is isomorphic to the integral cohomology ring. Our results rely on interpreting the internal zonotopal algebra of a totally unimodular arrangement as an orbit harmonics ring, that is, as the associated graded of the ring of functions on a finite set of lattice points.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the coefficient of flow polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected bridgeless $(n,m)$-graph which may have loops and multiedges, and let $F(G,t)$ denote the flow polynomial of $G$. Dong and Koh \cite{Dong1} established an upper bound for the absolute value of coefficient $c_{i}$ of $t^{i}$ in the expansion of $F(G,t)$, where $0\leqslant i \leqslant m-n+1$. In this paper, we refine the aforementioned bound. Specifically, we demonstrate that when $n \leqslant m \leqslant n+3$, $|c_{i}|\leqslant d_{i}$, where $d_{i}$ is the coefficient of $t^{i}$ in the expansion $\prod\limits_{j=1}^{m-n+1}(t+j)$; and when $m\geqslant n+4$, $|c_{i}|\leqslant d_{i}$, with $d_{i}$ being the coefficient of $t^{i}$ in the expansion $(t+1)(t+2)(t+3)^{2}(t+4)^{m-n-3}$. Furthermore, we prove that if $G$ is a connected bridgeless cubic graph having only real flow roots, then $b_{i}\leqslant |c_{i}|$, where $b_{i}$ is the coefficient of $t^{i}$ in the expansion $(t+1)(t+2)^{\frac{n}{2}}$. Notably, if $G$ is simple connected bridgeless cubic graph with only real flow roots, then $b_{i}$ is the coefficient of $t^{i}$ in the expansion $(t+1)(t+2)^{\frac{n}{2}-2}(t+3)^{2}$.</description>

      <title>On the edge reconstruction of the second immanantal polynomials of undirected graph and digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=(m_{ij})$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. The second immanant of matrix $M$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} d_{2}(M)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}\chi_{2}(\sigma)\prod_{s=1}^{n}m_{s\sigma(s)}, \end{eqnarray*} where $\chi_{2}$ is the irreducible character of $S_{n}$ corresponding to the partition $(2^{1},1^{n-2})$. The polynomial $d_{2}(xI-M)$ is called the second immanantal polynomial of matrix $M$. Denote by $D(G)$ (resp. $D(\overrightarrow{G})$) and $A(G)$ (resp. $A(\overrightarrow{G})$) the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees and the adjacency matrix of undirected graph $G$ (resp. digraph $\overrightarrow{G}$), respectively. In this article, we prove that $d_{2}(xI-A(G))$ (resp. $d_{2}(xI-A(\overrightarrow{G}))$) can be reconstructed from the second immanantal polynomials of the adjacency matrix of all subgraphs in $\{G-uv,G-u-v|uv\in E(G)\}$ (resp. $\{\overrightarrow{G}-e|e\in E(\overrightarrow{G})\}$). Furthermore, the polynomial $d_{2}(xI-D(\overrightarrow{G})\pm A(\overrightarrow{G}))$ can also be reconstructed by the second immanantal polynomials of the (signless) Laplacian matrixs of all subgraphs in $\{\overrightarrow{G}-e|e\in E(\overrightarrow{G})\}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Brualdi-Goldwasser-Michael problem for maximum permanents of {\rm(0,1)}-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{U}(n,\tau)$ be the set of all {\rm(0,1)}-matrices of order $n$ with exactly $\tau$ 0's. Brualdi et al. investigated the maximum permanents of all matrices in $\mathscr{U}(n,\tau)$(R.A. Brualdi, J.L. Goldwasser, T.S. Michael, Maximum permanents of matrices of zeros and ones, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 47 (1988) 207--245.). And they put forward an open problem to characterize the maximum permanents among all matrices in $\mathscr{U}(n,\tau)$. In this paper, we focus on the problem. And we characterize the maximum permanents of all matrices in $\mathscr{U}(n,\tau)$ when $n^{2}-3n\leq\tau\leq n^{2}-2n-1$. Furthermore, we also prove the maximum permanents of all matrices in $\mathscr{U}(n,\tau)$ when $\sigma-kn\equiv0 (mod~k+1)$ and $(k+1)n-\sigma\equiv0(mod~k)$, where $\sigma=n^{2}-\tau$, $kn\leq\sigma\leq (k+1)n$ and $k$ is integer.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words, as those words having a Burrows--Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show how to interpret generalized de Bruijn words in terms of Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime, we give relations between generalized de Bruijn words, normal bases of finite fields, invertible circulant matrices, and Reutenauer groups. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

      <title>The Normal Play of the Domination Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call \textsc{Normal Domination Game}, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Finally, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the \textsc{Normal Domination Game} and its natural partizan variant.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of higher rank double ramification loci in genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double ramification loci parametrise marked curves where a weighted sum of the markings is linearly trivial; higher rank loci are obtained by imposing several such conditions simultaneously. We obtain closed formulae for the orbifold Euler characteristics of double ramification loci, and their higher rank generalisations, in genus one. The rank one formula is a polynomial, while the higher rank formula involves greatest common divisors of matrix minors. The proof is based on a recurrence relation in the Grothendieck ring, which allows for induction on the rank and number of markings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via G(0) = 0 and then G(n) = n -G(G(n -1)). Following Hofstadter, a family (F\_k) of similar functions is obtained by varying the number k of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions F\_k . In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions F k are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial X^k -X^(k-1) -1. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function F\_k , i.e., the maximal distance between F\_k and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when k $\le$ 4. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions F\_3 and F\_4 are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover F\_k can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when k $\le$ 2, while F\_k is almost additive exactly when k $\le$ 4. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of F\_3 .</description>

      <title>Learning the symmetric group: large from small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems.
  We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.</description>

      <title>The GFB Tree and Tree Imbalance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the stringiest. We show that a wide range of subtree-sized based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>

Abstract: We study generalized fractional repetition codes that have zero skip cost, and which are based on covering designs. We show that a zero skip cost is always attainable, perhaps at a price of an expansion factor compared with the optimal size of fractional repetition codes based on Steiner systems. We provide three constructions, as well as show non-constructively, that no expansion is needed for all codes based on sufficiently large covering systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>Volumes of odd strata of quadratic differentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We express the Masur--Veech volumes of "completed" strata of quadratic differentials with only odd singularities as a sum over stable graphs. This formula generalizes the formula of Delecroix-Goujard-Zograf-Zorich for principal strata. The coefficients of the formula are in our case intersection numbers of psi classes with the Witten-Kontsevich combinatorial classes; they naturally appear in the count of metric ribbon graphs with prescribed odd valencies. The "completed" strata that we consider are unions of odd strata and some adjacent strata, that contribute to the Masur--Veech volume with explicit weights. We present several conjectures on the large genus asymptotics of these Masur--Veech volumes that could be tackled with this formula.</description>

      <title>On Preserving or Reversing Higher-Order Unimodality and Convexity by Sign-Regular Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13136v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates preserving and reversing unimodality and convexity properties for sequences under transformations defined by sign-regular kernels. It is shown that these transformations only preserve these properties if the kernels are totally positive of order three or their additive inverse is totally negative of order three. In contrast, these transformations reverse these properties if the underlying kernel is totally negative or if its additive inverse is a totally positive kernel, both of order three. Furthermore, these results are extended to higher-order convex and multimodal sequences. These findings, which expand upon Karlin's earlier results on convexity, form the basis for deriving sufficient conditions for the preservation or reversal of higher-order convexity or generalised unimodality of a quotient of sequences, where both the numerator and denominator are transformations by the same sign-regular kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian transformation is the linear operator on polynomials in one variable with real coefficients which maps the powers of this variable to the corresponding Eulerian polynomials. The derangement transformation is defined similarly. Br\"and\'en and Jochemko have conjectured that the Eulerian transforms of a class of polynomials with nonnegative coefficients, which includes those having all their roots in the interval $[-1,0]$, have only real zeros. This conjecture is proven in this paper. More general transformations are introduced in the combinatorial-geometric context of uniform triangulations of simplicial complexes, where Eulerian and derangement transformations arise in the special case of barycentric subdivision, and are shown to have strong unimodality and gamma-positivity properties. General real-rootedness conjectures for these transformations, which unify various results and conjectures in the literature, are also proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many algorithms for inserting elements into tableaux are known, starting with the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Much of those processes can be incorporated into the general framework of Fomin's "growth diagrams". Even for single types of tableaux, there are various alternative insertion algorithms and, due to the varying ways they are described, the relationships between the algorithms can be obscure. The distinguishing features of many algorithms can be codified into graphic "insertion diagrams" which make important aspects of the algorithms immediately apparent. We use insertion diagrams to build a graphic catalog or picture book of many of the tableau insertion algorithms in the literature.</description>

Abstract: A 1965 result of Crapo shows that every elementary lift of a matroid $M$ can be constructed from a linear class of circuits of $M$. In a recent paper, Walsh generalized this construction by defining a rank-$k$ lift of a matroid $M$ given a rank-$k$ matroid $N$ on the set of circuits of $M$, and conjectured that all matroid lifts can be obtained in this way. In this sequel paper we simplify Walsh's construction and show that this conjecture is true for representable matroids but is false in general. This gives a new way to certify that a particular matroid is non-representable, which we use to construct new classes of non-representable matroids.
  Walsh also applied the new matroid lift construction to gain graphs over the additive group of a non-prime finite field, generalizing a construction of Zaslavsky for these special groups. He conjectured that this construction is possible on three or more vertices only for the additive group of a non-prime finite field. We show that this conjecture holds for four or more vertices, but fails for exactly three.</description>

      <title>Flat origami is Turing Complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Flat origami" refers to the folding of flat, zero-curvature paper such that the finished object lies in a plane. Mathematically, flat origami consists of a continuous, piecewise isometric map $f:P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ along with a layer ordering $\lambda_f:P\times P\to \{-1,1\}$ that tracks which points of $P$ are above/below others when folded. The set of crease lines that a flat origami makes (i.e., the set on which the mapping $f$ is non-differentiable) is called its "crease pattern." Flat origami mappings and their layer orderings can possess surprisingly intricate structure. For instance, determining whether or not a given straight-line planar graph drawn on $P$ is the crease pattern for some flat origami has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, and this result from 1996 led to numerous explorations in computational aspects of flat origami. In this paper we prove that flat origami, when viewed as a computational device, is Turing complete, or more specifically P-complete. We do this by showing that flat origami crease patterns with "optional creases" (creases that might be folded or remain unfolded depending on constraints imposed by other creases or inputs) can be constructed to simulate Rule 110, a one-dimensional cellular automaton that was proven to be Turing complete by Matthew Cook in 2004.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via improved eigenvalue multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of lines passing through the origin in an inner product space is said to be equiangular if every pair of lines defines the same angle. In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel raised what has since become a central question in the study of equiangular lines in Euclidean spaces. They asked for the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with a common angle of $\arccos{\frac{1}{2k-1}}$ for any integer $k \geq 2$. We show that the answer equals $r-1+\left\lfloor\frac{r-1}{k-1}\right\rfloor,$ provided that $r$ is at least exponential in a polynomial in $k$. This improves upon a recent breakthrough of Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang, and Zhao [Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743], who showed that this holds for $r$ at least doubly exponential in a polynomial in $k$. We also show that for any common angle $\arccos{\alpha}$, the answer equals $r+o(r)$ already when $r$ is superpolynomial in $1/\alpha \to \infty$.
  The key new ingredient underlying our results is an improved upper bound on the multiplicity of the second-largest eigenvalue of a graph. In one of the regimes, this improves and significantly extends a result of McKenzie, Rasmussen, and Srivastava [STOC 2021, pp. 396-407].</description>

      <title>Tropical combinatorics of max-linear Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>The fractional Helly number for separable convexity spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convex lattice set in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the intersection of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A well-known theorem of Doignon states that the Helly number of $d$-dimensional convex lattice sets equals $2^d$, while a remarkable theorem of B\'ar\'any and Matou\v{s}ek states that the fractional Helly number is only $d+1$. In this paper we generalize their result to abstract convexity spaces that are equipped with a suitable separation property. We also disprove a conjecture of B\'ar\'any and Kalai about an existence of fractional Helly property for a family of solutions of bounded-degree polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <title>Strongly Regular Graphs with Generalized Denniston and Dual Generalized Denniston Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two families of strongly regular Cayley graphs, or equivalently, partial difference sets, based on elementary abelian groups. The parameters of these two families are generalizations of the Denniston and the dual Denniston parameters, in contrast to the well known Latin square type and negative Latin square type parameters. The two families unify and subsume a number of existing constructions which have been presented in various contexts such as strongly regular graphs, partial difference sets, projective sets, and projective two-weight codes, notably including Denniston's seminal construction concerning maximal arcs in classical projective planes with even order. Our construction generates further momentum in this area, which recently saw exciting progress on the construction of the analogue of the famous Denniston partial difference sets in odd characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal{C}$ has polynomial expansion if there is a polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, each of the depth-$r$ minors of $G$ has average degree at most $f(r)$. In this note, we study bounded-radius variants of some classical graph parameters such as bramble number, linkedness and well-linkedness, and we show that they are pairwise polynomially related. Furthermore, in a monotone graph class with polynomial expansion they are all uniformly bounded by a polynomial in $r$.</description>

      <title>A positivity conjecture for a quotient of $q$-binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. Moreover, we move ahead to extend our conjecture to D. Stanton's fake Gaussian sequences. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cancellation of a critical pair in discrete Morse theory and its effect on (co)boundary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Morse theory helps us compute the homology groups of simplicial complexes in an efficient manner. A "good" gradient vector field reduces the number of critical simplices, simplifying the homology calculations by reducing them to the computation of homology groups of a simpler chain complex. This homology computation hinges on an efficient enumeration of gradient trajectories. The technique of cancelling pairs of critical simplices reduces the number of critical simplices, though it also perturbs the gradient trajectories. In this article, we demonstrate that (the matrix of) a certain modified boundary operator of interest can be derived from the corresponding original boundary operator through a sequence of elementary row operations. Thus, it eliminates the need of enumeration of the new gradient trajectories. We also obtain a similar result for coboundary operators.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spherical designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>

      <title>On cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly-doubly-regular tournaments have played significant roles in extremal graph theory. In this note, we construct new cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and determine their spectrum by establishing a new connection between cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and almost difference sets from combinatorial design theory. Furthermore, under the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F in analytic number theory, our results confirm the conjecture due to Sergey Savchenko (J. Graph Theory {\bf 83} (2016), 44--77) on the existence of infinitely many nearly-doubly-regular tournaments with the canonical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bipartite $q$-Kneser graphs and two-generated irreducible linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V:=(\mathbb{F}_q)^d$ be a $d$-dimensional vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of order $q$. Fix positive integers $e_1,e_2$ satisfying $e_1+e_2=d$. Motivated by analysing a fundamental algorithm in computational group theory for recognising classical groups, we consider a certain quantity $P(e_1,e_2)$ which arises in both graph theory and group representation theory: $P(e_1,e_2)$ is the proportion of $3$-walks in the `bipartite $q$-Kneser graph' $\Gamma_{e_1,e_2}$ that are closed $3$-arcs. We prove that, for a group $G$ satisfying ${\rm SL}_d(q)\leqslant G\leqslant{\rm GL}_d(q)$, the proportion of certain element-pairs in $G$ called `$(e_1,e_2)$-stingray duos' which generate an irreducible subgroup is also equal to $P(e_1,e_2)$. We give an exact formula for $P(e_1,e_2)$, and prove that $1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}&lt; P(e_1,e_2)&lt; 1-q^{-1}-q^{-2}+2q^{-3}-2q^{-5}$ for $2\leqslant e_2\leqslant e_1$ and $q\geqslant2$.These bounds have implications for the complexity analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms to recognise classical groups, which we discuss in the final section.</description>

      <title>Holey graphs: very large Betti numbers are testable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the graph property of having a (very) large $k$-th Betti number $\beta_k$ for constant $k$ is testable with a constant number of queries in the dense graph model. More specifically, we consider a clique complex defined by an underlying graph and prove that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $\delta(\varepsilon,k)&gt;0$ such that testing whether $\beta_k \geq (1-\delta) d_k$ for $\delta \leq \delta(\varepsilon,k)$ reduces to tolerantly testing $(k+2)$-clique-freeness, which is known to be testable. This complements a result by Elek (2010) showing that Betti numbers are testable in the bounded-degree model. Our result combines the Euler characteristic, matroid theory and the graph removal lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a double shifted power analog of free fermion fields to introduce current operators, Hamiltonians, and vertex operators which are deformed by two families of parameters and satisfy analogous formulas to the classical case. We show that the deformed half vertex operators correspond to the row transfer matrices of a solvable six vertex model recently given by Naprienko [arXiv:2301.12110], which under a specialization yields the factorial Schur functions (up to a reindexing of parameters). As a consequence, we show that under the boson-fermion correspondence using our deformed half vertex operators, the natural basis (under this specialization) maps to the double factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, the image of the natural basis vectors are tau function solutions to the 2D Toda lattice.</description>
