      <title>Proton cumulants from hydrodynamics in light of new STAR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New measurements of proton number cumulants from the Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC by the STAR Collaboration provide unprecedented precision and insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter. This report discusses the measurements in the context of predictions from hydrodynamics, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of factorial cumulants and their implications for the search for the QCD critical point. The experimental data shows enhancement of second-order factorial cumulants and suppression of third-order factorial cumulants relative to the non-critical baseline at $7.7 &lt; \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \lesssim 10$ GeV. We discuss implications of this observation for the possible location of the critical point in the QCD phase diagram and opportunities for future measurements of acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants.</description>

      <title>A simple schematic model for a cross section deficit in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cross section deficit phenomenon has been observed in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reactions at astrophysical energies, at which fusion cross sections are suppressed in the off-resonance regions as compared to fusion cross sections for the $^{12}$C+$^{13}$C system. I here construct a simple schematic model which simulates this phenomenon. The model consists of a random matrix Hamiltonian based on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), which is coupled to an entrance channel Hamiltonian in the discrete basis representation. I show that the transmission coefficients are almost unity when both the level density and the decay widths of the GOE configurations are large, realizing the strong absorption regime. On the other hand, when these parameters are small, the transmission coefficients are significantly structured as a function of energy. In that situation, the transmission coefficients at resonance energies reach unity in this model, that is consistent with the experimental finding of the cross section deficit.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of {\alpha}-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei based on Coulomb and proximity potential models with temperature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the Coulomb proximity potential model (CPPM) in conjunction with 22 distinct proximity potential models, we investigated the temperature dependence and the effects of proton number and neutron number on the diffusion parameters that determine the {\alpha}-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei. The results indicate that the Prox.77-3 T-DEP proximity potential model yields the best performance, with the lowest root mean square deviation ({\sigma}=0.515), reflecting a high consistency with experimental data. In contrast, Bass77, AW95, Ngo80, and Guo2013 display larger deviations. The inclusion of temperature dependence significantly improves the accuracy of models such as Prox.77-3, Prox.77-6, and Prox.77-7. The -decay half-lives of 36 potential superheavy nuclei were further predicted using the five most accurate proximity potential models and Ni's empirical formula, with the results aligning well with experimental data. These predictions underscore the high reliability of the CPPM combined with proximity potential models in the theoretical calculation of {\alpha}-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei, offering valuable theoretical insights for future experimental investigations of superheavy nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The straightforward calculations of the reaction and interaction cross sections of the nuclear scattering are carried out in Glauber approach using the generating function method. It allows for the resummation of all orders of Glauber theory. The results are obtained for $^4$He, $^{11}$Li, $^{12}$C scattering on $^{12}$C target. The difference between the reaction and the differential cross section is shown to be not exceeding several percents</description>

      <title>A microscopic calculation of fission cross sections with the non-equilibrium Green function method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method to microscopically evaluate fission cross sections for the neutron induced $^{235}$U$(n,f)$ reaction. While the model space was restricted only to seniority zero configurations in the previous applications of the NEGF method, we remove this restriction and include seniority non-zero configurations as well. In such model space, a proton-neutron interaction is active, for which we introduce a random interaction. We find that the seniority non-zero configurations significantly increase the fission cross sections, and thus the fission-to-capture branching ratios, even though they are still underestimated by about one order of magnitude as compared to the experimental data. In addition, we also find that the fission dynamics is governed by only a small number of eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Towards the determination of CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon matrix elements (NMEs) associated with quark chromo-magnetic dipole moments (cMDMs) play a crucial role in determining the CP-odd pion-nucleon couplings induced by quark chromo-electric dipole moments. In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms.</description>

      <title>Pion Gravitational Form Factors in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the momentum-transfer dependence of the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs) within a top-down holographic QCD framework. These form factors encode essential information about the internal stress distribution of hadrons and may serve as a tool to explore the non-perturbatice dyanmics responsible for quark and gluon confinement in QCD. In particular, we evaluate the forward-limit value of the GFFs, known as the D-term, within the framework of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Our analysis also reveals glueball dominance, wherein the pion's gravitational interaction is mediated by an infinite tower of glueball excitations.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy quark spectra and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the glasma classical color fields, produced in the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions, on the transport of heavy quarks. The glasma fields evolve according to the classical Yang-Mills equations, while the dynamics of heavy quarks is described by Wong's equations. We numerically solve these equations and compute the transport coefficient $\kappa$, which is anisotropic and initially very large. Further, we extract observables sensitive to the initial glasma stage. The heavy quark nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is affected by the glasma but the effect is moderate compared to the nPDF contribution. Our main finding is that the glasma has a large impact on the azimuthal correlation between $Q\overline{Q}$ pairs, initially produced back-to-back.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Electric Quadrupole Moments and Isotope Shift Constants of Yb$^+$ in Pursuance of Probing Fundamental Physics and Nuclear Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemplating to register signature of a new vector boson unambiguously from the measured non-linear isotope shift (IS) effects in three recent experiments [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 12}, 021033 (2022); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022) and Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 063002 (2025)], very precise values of quadrupole moments and IS constants for the $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ and $6s ~ ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 5d ~ ^2D_{5/2}$ clock transitions of $^{171}$Yb$^+$ are presented. This is accomplished by incorporating contributions from the computationally challenging triply excited configurations through the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. Testament of quality atomic wave functions of states of the above transitions, obtained using the RCC theory, are gauged by comparing the calculated energies and magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants with their measurements. The improved quadrupole moments from this work will be immensely useful to estimate quadrupole shifts of the clock transitions of Yb$^+$. Complementary approaches are employed to ascertain accuracy and comprehend roles of orbital relaxation and correlation effects in evaluating the IS constants. Combining these constants with the IS measurements from Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 163201 (2022), differential nuclear charge radii of the Yb isotopes are inferred that deviate by 6-7\% from the literature data.</description>

      <title>Isospin asymmetry and neutron stars in V-QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ helicity amplitudes and transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <title>Determining the minimal mass of a proto-neutron star with chirally constrained nuclear equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution are investigated. In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \sim 0.62M_{\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \sim 0.22M_{\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used.</description>

Abstract: Pairing plays a crucial role in the microscopic description of nuclear fission. Microscopic methods provide access to three quantities related to pairing, namely, the pairing gap ($\Delta$), the particle number fluctuations ($ \Delta \hat{N}^2 $), and the quenching factor (QF). The aim of this work is to analyse the impact of each of these quantities on the static description of the fission process.</description>

      <title>Exploring nuclear force with pulsar glitch observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We connect nuclear forces to one of the most notable irregular behaviors observed in pulsars, already detected in approximately 6\% known pulsars, with increasingly accurate data expected from upcoming high-precision timing instruments on both ground and space. Built on Shang &amp; Li (2021), we conduct a case study on the 2001 glitch of the Vela pulsar. For our purpose, we adopt the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model as the theoretical many-body framework to describe nuclear systems. We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the snowplow model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Global Framework for Emulation of Nuclear Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines ab initio many-body calculations with a Bayesian neural network, developing emulators capable of accurately predicting nuclear properties across isotopic chains simultaneously and being applicable to different regions of the nuclear chart. We benchmark our developments using the oxygen isotopic chain, achieving accurate results for ground-state energies and nuclear charge radii, while providing robust uncertainty quantification. Our framework enables global sensitivity analysis of nuclear binding energies and charge radii with respect to the low-energy constants that describe the nuclear force.</description>

      <title>A unified description of small, peripheral, and large system suppression data from pQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantitative predictions for the nuclear modification factor in both small and peripheral systems from a pQCD-based energy loss model that is constrained by light- and heavy-flavor suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions. We find nearly identical suppression for central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, quantitatively consistent with the measured 20% suppression of neutral pions produced in $d + \mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX, but dramatically inconsistent with the measured 20% enhancement of charged hadrons produced in $p + \mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS. We demonstrate that this equivalence of central small system suppression and peripheral large system suppression is insensitive to the underlying energy loss model.</description>

      <title>Finite-size effects on small-$x$ evolution and saturation in proton and nuclear targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, we assess the importance of including a finite size for the target on observables sensitive to small-$x$ evolution. To this end, we study the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation with impact-parameter dependence in the initial condition. We demonstrate that neglecting the dependence on the impact parameter can result in overestimated saturation effects for protons, while it has little effect for heavy nuclei at the energies available at current experiments. When fixing the nonperturbative parameters to the energy dependence of the exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction cross section with proton targets, predictions for lead targets are not sensitive to the applied running-coupling prescription, the scheme chosen to resum large transverse logarithms in the BK equation, or the infrared regulator in the evolution.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>Multidisciplinary Science in the Multimessenger Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Scattering: Connections Across Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>
