      <title>A short way to the stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longer and more correct title is `a short and direct path to the theory of stable contract systems in a bipartite market'. There is no new meaningful results in the article. It is dedicated to the presentation of a short method for obtaining the main body of stability theory: existence, polarization, and latticing. The brevity and uniformity are achieved through the use of the desirability operator (Section 1) and, most importantly, the successful notion of an ample system of contracts (Section 3). The use of the latter radically simplifies the problem of the existence of fixed points. The general bipartite problem (with many agents using Plott choice functions) is reduced easily by the aggregation to the case of two agents (see [2, 5]). Therefore, further, we restrict ourselves to the case of two agents (the Worker and the Firm) and a large set E of contracts between them.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making for Goods with Perishable Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decentralized markets for goods whose utility perishes in time, with compute as a primary motivation. Recent advances in reproducible and verifiable execution allow jobs to pause, verify, and resume across heterogeneous hardware, which allow us to treat compute as time indexed capacity rather than bespoke bundles. We design an automated market maker (AMM) that posts an hourly price as a concave function of load--the ratio of current demand to a "floor supply" (providers willing to work at a preset floor). This mechanism decouples price discovery from allocation and yields transparent, low latency trading. We establish existence and uniqueness of equilibrium quotes and give conditions under which the equilibrium is admissible (i.e. active supply weakly exceeds demand). To align incentives, we pair a premium sharing pool (base cost plus a pro rata share of contemporaneous surplus) with a Cheapest Feasible Matching (CFM) rule; under mild assumptions, providers optimally stake early and fully while truthfully report costs. Despite being simple and computationally efficient, we show that CFM attains bounded worst case regret relative to an optimal benchmark.</description>

      <title>A general definition of perfect equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general definition of perfect equilibrium which is applicable to a wide class of games. A key feature is the concept of completely mixed nets of strategies, based on a more detailed notion of carrier of a strategy. Under standard topological conditions, this definition yields a nonempty and compact set of perfect equilibria. For finite action sets, our notion of perfect equilibrium coincides with Selten's (1975) original notion. In the compact-continuous case, perfect equilibria are weak perfect equilibria in the sense of Simon and Stinchcombe (1995). In the finitely additive case, perfect equilibria in the sense of Marinacci (1997) are perfect. Under mild conditions, perfect equilibrium meets game-theoretic desiderata such as limit undominatedness and invariance. We provide a variety of examples to motivate and illustrate our definition. Notably, examples include applications to games with discontinuous payoffs and games played with finitely additive strategies.</description>
