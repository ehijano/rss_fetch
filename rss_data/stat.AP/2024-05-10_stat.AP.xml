      <title>Cancer mortality projection: disparities, COVID-19, and late diagnosis impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates projection of two major causes of cancer mortality, breast cancer and lung cancer, by using a Bayesian modelling framework. We investigate patterns in 2001-2018 (as baseline) in cause-specific cancer mortality and project these by year of death and various risk factors: age, gender, regions of England, income deprivation quintile, average age-at-diagnosis, and non-smoker prevalence rates. We then assess excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic years, and we examine the impact of diagnosis delays on lung cancer mortality across various scenarios. Our findings indicate that socio-economic disparities in lung cancer mortality will persist in the future. Additionally, we observe slight variations in breast cancer mortality across different regions up to 2036. Furthermore, marginal increases in excess deaths from lung and breast cancer are estimated in specific regions of England throughout the pandemic year (2020-2022), contrasting with the national trend. However, the excess lung cancer deaths markedly differ by age, region and deprivation as a result of delays in cancer diagnosis. Specifically, we find a notably higher number of excess deaths in the northern regions of England compared to the southern regions, as well as among individuals living in the most deprived areas compared to those in the least deprived areas.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Regression and Poststratification Interface: Application to Track Community-level COVID-19 Viral Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of comprehensive or random testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a proxy method for synthetic random sampling to estimate the actual viral incidence in the community, based on viral RNA testing of asymptomatic patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system. The approach collects routine testing data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure among outpatients and performs statistical adjustments of sample representation using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP). MRP adjusts for selection bias and yields stable small area estimates. We have developed an open-source, user-friendly MRP interface for public implementation of the statistical workflow. We illustrate the MRP interface with an application to track community-level COVID-19 viral transmission in the state of Michigan.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of water table depth estimation: Challenges and opportunities within machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-resolution spatial patterns of water table depth (WTD) can inform the dynamics of groundwater-dependent systems, including ecological, hydrological, and anthropogenic systems. Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) spatial map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. We interpret the black box of our physically constrained ML models and compare it against available literature in groundwater hydrology. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation, we demonstrate that our models can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD across most of North America's ecoregions compared to three available PB simulations of WTD. However, we still argue that large-scale WTD estimation is far from being a solved problem. We reason that due to biased and untrustworthy observational data, the misspecification of physically-based equations, and the over-flexibility of machine learning models, our community's confidence in ML or PB simulations of WTD is far too high and verifiably accurate simulations of WTD do not yet exist in the literature, particularly in arid high-elevation landscapes. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to proceed with WTD estimations, with a particular focus on the application of machine learning.</description>

      <title>How Generalizable Is My Behavior Cloning Policy? A Statistical Approach to Trustworthy Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source.</description>

      <title>Parametric Analysis of Bivariate Current Status data with Competing risks using Frailty model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared and correlated Gamma frailty models are widely used in the literature to model the association in multivariate current status data. In this paper, we have proposed two other new Gamma frailty models, namely shared cause-specific and correlated cause-specific Gamma frailty to capture association in bivariate current status data with competing risks. We have investigated the identifiability of the bivariate models with competing risks for each of the four frailty variables. We have considered maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. Thorough simulation studies have been performed to study the finite sample behaviour of the estimated parameters. Also, we have analyzed a real data set on hearing loss in two ears using Exponential type and Weibull type cause-specific baseline hazard functions with the four different Gamma frailty variables and compare the fits using AIC.</description>

      <title>Reliability analysis of arbitrary systems based on active learning and global sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System reliability analysis aims at computing the probability of failure of an engineering system given a set of uncertain inputs and limit state functions. Active-learning solution schemes have been shown to be a viable tool but as of yet they are not as efficient as in the context of component reliability analysis. This is due to some peculiarities of system problems, such as the presence of multiple failure modes and their uneven contribution to failure, or the dependence on the system configuration (e.g., series or parallel). In this work, we propose a novel active learning strategy designed for solving general system reliability problems. This algorithm combines subset simulation and Kriging/PC-Kriging, and relies on an enrichment scheme tailored to specifically address the weaknesses of this class of methods. More specifically, it relies on three components: (i) a new learning function that does not require the specification of the system configuration, (ii) a density-based clustering technique that allows one to automatically detect the different failure modes, and (iii) sensitivity analysis to estimate the contribution of each limit state to system failure so as to select only the most relevant ones for enrichment. The proposed method is validated on two analytical examples and compared against results gathered in the literature. Finally, a complex engineering problem related to power transmission is solved, thereby showcasing the efficiency of the proposed method in a real-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is vital to safety-critical model-based analyses, but the widespread adoption of sophisticated UQ methods is limited by technical complexity. In this paper, we introduce UM-Bridge (the UQ and Modeling Bridge), a high-level abstraction and software protocol that facilitates universal interoperability of UQ software with simulation codes. It breaks down the technical complexity of advanced UQ applications and enables separation of concerns between experts. UM-Bridge democratizes UQ by allowing effective interdisciplinary collaboration, accelerating the development of advanced UQ methods, and making it easy to perform UQ analyses from prototype to High Performance Computing (HPC) scale.
  In addition, we present a library of ready-to-run UQ benchmark problems, all easily accessible through UM-Bridge. These benchmarks support UQ methodology research, enabling reproducible performance comparisons. We demonstrate UM-Bridge with several scientific applications, harnessing HPC resources even using UQ codes not designed with HPC support.</description>
