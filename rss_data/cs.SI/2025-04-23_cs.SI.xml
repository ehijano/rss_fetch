      <title>New Recipe for Semi-supervised Community Detection: Clique Annealing under Crystallization Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised community detection methods are widely used for identifying specific communities due to the label scarcity. Existing semi-supervised community detection methods typically involve two learning stages learning in both initial identification and subsequent adjustment, which often starts from an unreasonable community core candidate. Moreover, these methods encounter scalability issues because they depend on reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks, leading to higher computational costs and restricting the selection of candidates. To address these limitations, we draw a parallel between crystallization kinetics and community detection to integrate the spontaneity of the annealing process into community detection. Specifically, we liken community detection to identifying a crystal subgrain (core) that expands into a complete grain (community) through a process similar to annealing. Based on this finding, we propose CLique ANNealing (CLANN), which applies kinetics concepts to community detection by integrating these principles into the optimization process to strengthen the consistency of the community core. Subsequently, a learning-free Transitive Annealer was employed to refine the first-stage candidates by merging neighboring cliques and repositioning the community core, enabling a spontaneous growth process that enhances scalability. Extensive experiments on \textbf{43} different network settings demonstrate that CLANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world datasets, showcasing its exceptional efficacy and efficiency in community detection.</description>

      <title>Are Widely Known Findings Easier to Retract?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Failures of retraction are common in science. Why do these failures occur? And, relatedly, what makes findings harder or easier to retract? We use data from Microsoft Academic Graph, Retraction Watch, and Altmetric -- including retracted papers, citation records, and Altmetric scores and mentions -- to test recently proposed answers to these questions. A recent previous study by LaCroix et al. employ simple network models to argue that the social spread of scientific information helps explain failures of retraction. One prediction of their models is that widely known or well established results, surprisingly, should be easier to retract, since their retraction is more relevant to more scientists. Our results support this conclusion. We find that highly cited papers show more significant reductions in citation after retraction and garner more attention to their retractions as they occur.</description>

      <title>Computing well-balanced spanning trees of unweighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spanning tree of a network or graph is a subgraph that connects all nodes with the least number or weight of edges. The spanning tree is one of the most straightforward techniques for network simplification and sampling, and for discovering its backbone or skeleton. Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are well-known algorithms for computing a spanning tree of a weighted network, and are therefore also the default procedure for unweighted networks in the most popular network libraries. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of these algorithms on unweighted networks and compare them with different priority-first search algorithms. We show that the structure of a network, such as the distances between the nodes, is better preserved by a simpler algorithm based on breadth-first search. The spanning trees are also most compact and well-balanced as measured by classical graph indices. We support our findings with experiments on synthetic graphs and more than a thousand real networks, and demonstrate practical applications of the computed spanning trees. We conclude that if a spanning tree is to maintain the structure of an unweighted network, the breadth-first search algorithm should be the preferred choice.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Model for Vehicle-Centric Data Sharing Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of technologies has prompted a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, with an increasing focus on connected services and autonomous driving capabilities. This transformation allows vehicles to collect and share vast amounts of vehicle-specific and personal data. While these technological advancements offer enhanced user experiences, they also raise privacy concerns. To understand the ecosystem of data collection and sharing in modern vehicles, we adopted the ontology 101 methodology to incorporate information extracted from different sources, including analysis of privacy policies using GPT-4, a small-scale systematic literature review, and an existing ontology, to develop a high-level conceptual graph-based model, aiming to get insights into how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. This serves as a foundational model with the flexibility and scalability to further expand for modelling and analysing data sharing practices across diverse contexts. Two realistic examples were developed to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of discovering insights into privacy regarding vehicle-related data sharing. We also recommend several future research directions, such as exploring advanced ontology languages for reasoning tasks, supporting topological analysis for discovering data privacy risks/concerns, and developing useful tools for comparative analysis, to strengthen the understanding of the vehicle-centric data sharing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Technological Complexity Based on Japanese Patent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is difficult because a technology is independent, therefore has complex nature. Here, this study aims to assess patent technological fields by applying Technological Complexity Index from a corporate perspective, addressing its underutilization in Japan despite its potential. By utilizing carefully processed patent data from fiscal years 1981 to 2010, we analyze the bipartite network which consists of 1,938 corporations and 35 or 124 technological fields. Our findings provide quantitative characteristics of ubiquity and sophistication for patent fields, the detailed technological trends that reflect the social context, and methodological stability for policymakers and researchers, contributing to targeted innovation strategies in Japan.</description>

      <title>On the accurate computation of expected modularity in probabilistic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modularity is one of the most widely used measures for evaluating communities in networks. In probabilistic networks, where the existence of edges is uncertain and uncertainty is represented by probabilities, the expected value of modularity can be used instead. However, efficiently computing expected modularity is challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient technique (FPWP) for computing the probability distribution of modularity and its expected value. In this paper, we implement and compare our method and various general approaches for expected modularity computation in probabilistic networks. These include: (1) translating probabilistic networks into deterministic ones by removing low-probability edges or treating probabilities as weights, (2) using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate expected modularity, and (3) brute-force computation. We evaluate the accuracy and time efficiency of FPWP through comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks with diverse characteristics. Our results demonstrate that removing low-probability edges or treating probabilities as weights produces inaccurate results, while the convergence of the sampling method varies with the parameters of the network. Brute-force computation, though accurate, is prohibitively slow. In contrast, our method is much faster than brute-force computation, but guarantees an accurate result.</description>
