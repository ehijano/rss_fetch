      <title>Fast and Automatic Full Waveform Inversion by Dual Augmented Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) stands as a nonlinear, high-resolution technology for subsurface imaging via surface-recorded data. This paper introduces an augmented Lagrangian dual formulation for FWI, rooted in the viewpoint that Lagrange multipliers serve as fundamental unknowns for the accurate linearization of the FWI problem. Once these multipliers are estimated, the determination of model parameters becomes simple. Therefore, unlike traditional primal algorithms, the proposed dual method circumvents direct engagement with model parameters or wavefields, instead tackling the estimation of Lagrange multipliers through a gradient ascent iteration. This approach yields two significant advantages: i) the background model remains fixed, requiring only one LU matrix factorization for each frequency inversion. ii) Convergence of the algorithm can be improved by leveraging techniques like quasi-Newton l-BFGS methods and Anderson acceleration. Numerical examples from elastic and acoustic FWI utilizing different benchmark models are provided, showing that the dual algorithm converges quickly and requires fewer computations than the standard primal algorithm.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid Ablation within the Jovian Atmosphere: Implications on the Oxygen Delivery to the Gas Giant's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of water molecules within the atmosphere of Jupiter, first by the Galileo Atmospheric Probe, and later by the Juno spacecraft, has given rise to the question of whether those molecules are sourced endogenously or exogenously. One hypothesis is that the ablation of meteoroids deposited the necessary oxygen into the atmosphere, which was subsequently used in chemical processes to form water. This paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis by simulating the ablation of carbonaceous objects entering the planet's atmosphere to determine the possible rates of oxygen delivery and the most likely altitude for such delivery within the Jovian atmosphere. We estimate that carbonaceous meteoroids have the potential to deliver $\sim 1.4 \times 10^7 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over a billion years. We further estimate that most of the ablation is expected to occur in the stratosphere, or 450-400 km above the region of 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. In comparison, Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) are estimated to deliver roughly $\sim 10^2 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over the same period.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earthquake science and seismology rely on the ability to associate seismic waves with their originating earthquakes. Earthquake detection algorithms based on deep learning have progressed rapidly and now routinely detect microearthquakes with unprecedented clarity, providing information about fault dynamics on increasingly finer spatiotemporal scales. However, this densification of detections can overwhelm existing techniques for phase association which rely on fixed wave speed models and associate events one by one. These methods fail when the event rates become high or where the 4D complexity of elastic wave speeds cannot be ignored. Here, we introduce HARPA, a deep learning solution to this problem. HARPA is a high-rate association framework which incorporates wave physics by leveraging deep generative models and travel time neural fields. Instead of associating events one by one, it lifts arrival sequences to probability distributions and compares them using an optimal transport metric. The generative travel time neural fields are used to estimate the wave speed simultaneously with association. HARPA outperforms state-of-the-art association methods for both real seismic data and complex synthetic models and paves the way for improved understanding of seismicity while establishing a new seismic data analysis paradigm.</description>
