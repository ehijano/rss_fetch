      <title>Early Joint Learning of Emotion Information Makes MultiModal Model Understand You Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our solutions for emotion recognition in the sub-challenges of Multimodal Emotion Recognition Challenge (MER2024). To mitigate the modal competition issue between audio and text, we adopt an early fusion strategy based on a large language model, where joint training of audio and text is conducted initially. And the joint Audio-Text modal feature will be late-fused with other unimodal features. In order to solve the problems of data insufficiency and class imbalance, We use multiple turns of multi-model voting for data mining. Moreover, to enhance the quality of audio features, we employ speech source separation to preprocess audios. Our model ranks \textbf{2nd} in both MER2024-SEMI and MER2024-NOISE, validating our method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>From Vision to Audio and Beyond: A Unified Model for Audio-Visual Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video encompasses both visual and auditory data, creating a perceptually rich experience where these two modalities complement each other. As such, videos are a valuable type of media for the investigation of the interplay between audio and visual elements. Previous studies of audio-visual modalities primarily focused on either audio-visual representation learning or generative modeling of a modality conditioned on the other, creating a disconnect between these two branches. A unified framework that learns representation and generates modalities has not been developed yet. In this work, we introduce a novel framework called Vision to Audio and Beyond (VAB) to bridge the gap between audio-visual representation learning and vision-to-audio generation. The key approach of VAB is that rather than working with raw video frames and audio data, VAB performs representation learning and generative modeling within latent spaces. In particular, VAB uses a pre-trained audio tokenizer and an image encoder to obtain audio tokens and visual features, respectively. It then performs the pre-training task of visual-conditioned masked audio token prediction. This training strategy enables the model to engage in contextual learning and simultaneous video-to-audio generation. After the pre-training phase, VAB employs the iterative-decoding approach to rapidly generate audio tokens conditioned on visual features. Since VAB is a unified model, its backbone can be fine-tuned for various audio-visual downstream tasks. Our experiments showcase the efficiency of VAB in producing high-quality audio from video, and its capability to acquire semantic audio-visual features, leading to competitive results in audio-visual retrieval and classification.</description>

      <title>IWN: Image Watermarking Based on Idempotency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the expanding field of digital media, maintaining the strength and integrity of watermarking technology is becoming increasingly challenging. This paper, inspired by the Idempotent Generative Network (IGN), explores the prospects of introducing idempotency into image watermark processing and proposes an innovative neural network model - the Idempotent Watermarking Network (IWN). The proposed model, which focuses on enhancing the recovery quality of color image watermarks, leverages idempotency to ensure superior image reversibility. This feature ensures that, even if color image watermarks are attacked or damaged, they can be effectively projected and mapped back to their original state. Therefore, the extracted watermarks have unquestionably increased quality. The IWN model achieves a balance between embedding capacity and robustness, alleviating to some extent the inherent contradiction between these two factors in traditional watermarking techniques and steganography methods.</description>

      <title>IDEAW: Robust Neural Audio Watermarking with Invertible Dual-Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The audio watermarking technique embeds messages into audio and accurately extracts messages from the watermarked audio. Traditional methods develop algorithms based on expert experience to embed watermarks into the time-domain or transform-domain of signals. With the development of deep neural networks, deep learning-based neural audio watermarking has emerged. Compared to traditional algorithms, neural audio watermarking achieves better robustness by considering various attacks during training. However, current neural watermarking methods suffer from low capacity and unsatisfactory imperceptibility. Additionally, the issue of watermark locating, which is extremely important and even more pronounced in neural audio watermarking, has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we design a dual-embedding watermarking model for efficient locating. We also consider the impact of the attack layer on the invertible neural network in robustness training, improving the model to enhance both its reasonableness and stability. Experiments show that the proposed model, IDEAW, can withstand various attacks with higher capacity and more efficient locating ability compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Signal Processing for Haptic Surface Modeling: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haptic feedback has been integrated into Virtual and Augmented Reality, complementing acoustic and visual information and contributing to an all-round immersive experience in multiple fields, spanning from the medical domain to entertainment and gaming. Haptic technologies involve complex cross-disciplinary research that encompasses sensing, data representation, interactive rendering, perception, and quality of experience. The standard processing pipeline, consists of (I) sensing physical features in the real world using a transducer, (II) modeling and storing the collected information in some digital format, (III) communicating the information, and finally, (IV) rendering the haptic information through appropriate devices, thus producing a user experience (V) perceptually close to the original physical world. Among these areas, sensing, rendering and perception have been deeply investigated and are the subject of different comprehensive surveys available in the literature. Differently, research dealing with haptic surface modeling and data representation still lacks a comprehensive dissection. In this work, we aim at providing an overview on modeling and representation of haptic surfaces from a signal processing perspective, covering the aspects that lie in between haptic information acquisition on one side and rendering and perception on the other side. We analyze, categorize, and compare research papers that address the haptic surface modeling and data representation, pointing out existing gaps and possible research directions.</description>

      <title>4Doodle: Two-handed Gestures for Immersive Sketching of Architectural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18887v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional immersive sketching for content creation and modeling has been studied for some time. However, research in this domain mainly focused on CAVE-like scenarios. These setups can be expensive and offer a narrow interaction space. Building more affordable setups using head-mounted displays is possible, allowing greater immersion and a larger space for user physical movements. This paper presents a fully immersive environment using bi-manual gestures to sketch and create content freely in the virtual world. This approach can be applied to many scenarios, allowing people to express their ideas or review existing designs. To cope with known motor difficulties and inaccuracy of freehand 3D sketching, we explore proxy geometry and a laser-like metaphor to draw content directly from models and create content surfaces. Our current prototype offers 24 cubic meters for movement, limited by the room size. It features infinite virtual drawing space through pan and scale techniques and is larger than the typical 6-sided cave at a fraction of the cost. In a preliminary study conducted with architects and engineers, our system showed a clear promise as a tool for sketching and 3D content creation in virtual reality with a great emphasis on bi-manual gestures.</description>

      <title>From Linguistic Giants to Sensory Maestros: A Survey on Cross-Modal Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal reasoning (CMR), the intricate process of synthesizing and drawing inferences across divergent sensory modalities, is increasingly recognized as a crucial capability in the progression toward more sophisticated and anthropomorphic artificial intelligence systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a class of AI algorithms specifically engineered to parse, produce, and engage with human language on an extensive scale. The recent trend of deploying LLMs to tackle CMR tasks has marked a new mainstream of approaches for enhancing their effectiveness. This survey offers a nuanced exposition of current methodologies applied in CMR using LLMs, classifying these into a detailed three-tiered taxonomy. Moreover, the survey delves into the principal design strategies and operational techniques of prototypical models within this domain. Additionally, it articulates the prevailing challenges associated with the integration of LLMs in CMR and identifies prospective research directions. To sum up, this survey endeavors to expedite progress within this burgeoning field by endowing scholars with a holistic and detailed vista, showcasing the vanguard of current research whilst pinpointing potential avenues for advancement.

      <title>Multimodal Markup Document Models for Graphic Design Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents multimodal markup document models (MarkupDM) that can generate both markup language and images within interleaved multimodal documents. Unlike existing vision-and-language multimodal models, our MarkupDM tackles unique challenges critical to graphic design tasks: generating partial images that contribute to the overall appearance, often involving transparency and varying sizes, and understanding the syntax and semantics of markup languages, which play a fundamental role as a representational format of graphic designs. To address these challenges, we design an image quantizer to tokenize images of diverse sizes with transparency and modify a code language model to process markup languages and incorporate image modalities. We provide in-depth evaluations of our approach on three graphic design completion tasks: generating missing attribute values, images, and texts in graphic design templates. Results corroborate the effectiveness of our MarkupDM for graphic design tasks. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses in detail, providing insights for future research on multimodal document generation.</description>

      <title>Extending Depth of Field for Varifocal Multiview Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical imaging systems are generally limited by the depth of field because of the nature of the optics. Therefore, extending depth of field (EDoF) is a fundamental task for meeting the requirements of emerging visual applications. To solve this task, the common practice is using multi-focus images from a single viewpoint. This method can obtain acceptable quality of EDoF under the condition of fixed field of view, but it is only applicable to static scenes and the field of view is limited and fixed. An emerging data type, varifocal multiview images have the potential to become a new paradigm for solving the EDoF, because the data contains more field of view information than multi-focus images. To realize EDoF of varifocal multiview images, we propose an end-to-end method for the EDoF, including image alignment, image optimization and image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Video DataFlywheel: Resolving the Impossible Data Trinity in Video-Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, video-language understanding has achieved great success through large-scale pre-training. However, data scarcity remains a prevailing challenge. This study quantitatively reveals an "impossible trinity" among data quantity, diversity, and quality in pre-training datasets. Recent efforts seek to refine large-scale, diverse ASR datasets compromised by low quality through synthetic annotations. These methods successfully leverage useful information in multimodal video content (frames, tags, ASR transcripts, etc.) to refine the original annotations. Nevertheless, they struggle to mitigate noise within synthetic annotations and lack scalability as the dataset size expands. To address these issues, we introduce the Video DataFlywheel framework, which iteratively refines video annotations with improved noise control methods. For iterative refinement, we first leverage a video-language model to generate synthetic annotations, resulting in a refined dataset. Then, we pre-train on it and fine-tune on human refinement examples for a stronger model. These processes are repeated for continuous improvement. For noise control, we present AdaTaiLr, a novel noise control method that requires weaker assumptions on noise distribution, thereby proving more effective in large datasets with theoretical guarantees. The combination of iterative refinement and AdaTaiLr can achieve better scalability in video-language understanding. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing data refinement baselines, delivering a 3% performance boost and improving dataset quality with minimal diversity loss. Furthermore, our refined dataset facilitates significant improvements in various video-language understanding tasks, including video question answering and text-video retrieval.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analysis of Audio-Visual Tasks: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of spoken language processing, audio-visual speech processing is receiving increasing research attention. Key components of this research include tasks such as lip reading, audio-visual speech recognition, and visual-to-speech synthesis. Although significant success has been achieved, theoretical analysis is still insufficient for audio-visual tasks. This paper presents a quantitative analysis based on information theory, focusing on information intersection between different modalities. Our results show that this analysis is valuable for understanding the difficulties of audio-visual processing tasks as well as the benefits that could be obtained by modality integration.</description>

      <title>Modeling Layout Reading Order as Ordering Relations for Visually-rich Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and leveraging layout reading order in visually-rich documents (VrDs) is critical in document intelligence as it captures the rich structure semantics within documents. Previous works typically formulated layout reading order as a permutation of layout elements, i.e. a sequence containing all the layout elements. However, we argue that this formulation does not adequately convey the complete reading order information in the layout, which may potentially lead to performance decline in downstream VrD tasks. To address this issue, we propose to model the layout reading order as ordering relations over the set of layout elements, which have sufficient expressive capability for the complete reading order information. To enable empirical evaluation on methods towards the improved form of reading order prediction (ROP), we establish a comprehensive benchmark dataset including the reading order annotation as relations over layout elements, together with a relation-extraction-based method that outperforms previous methods. Moreover, to highlight the practical benefits of introducing the improved form of layout reading order, we propose a reading-order-relation-enhancing pipeline to improve model performance on any arbitrary VrD task by introducing additional reading order relation inputs. Comprehensive results demonstrate that the pipeline generally benefits downstream VrD tasks: (1) with utilizing the reading order relation information, the enhanced downstream models achieve SOTA results on both two task settings of the targeted dataset; (2) with utilizing the pseudo reading order information generated by the proposed ROP model, the performance of the enhanced models has improved across all three models and eight cross-domain VrD-IE/QA task settings without targeted optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose WildFusion, a novel approach for 3D scene reconstruction in unstructured, in-the-wild environments using multimodal implicit neural representations. WildFusion integrates signals from LiDAR, RGB camera, contact microphones, tactile sensors, and IMU. This multimodal fusion generates comprehensive, continuous environmental representations, including pixel-level geometry, color, semantics, and traversability. Through real-world experiments on legged robot navigation in challenging forest environments, WildFusion demonstrates improved route selection by accurately predicting traversability. Our results highlight its potential to advance robotic navigation and 3D mapping in complex outdoor terrains.</description>

      <title>ProFD: Prompt-Guided Feature Disentangling for Occluded Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the occlusion issues in person Re-Identification (ReID) tasks, many methods have been proposed to extract part features by introducing external spatial information. However, due to missing part appearance information caused by occlusion and noisy spatial information from external model, these purely vision-based approaches fail to correctly learn the features of human body parts from limited training data and struggle in accurately locating body parts, ultimately leading to misaligned part features. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Prompt-guided Feature Disentangling method (ProFD), which leverages the rich pre-trained knowledge in the textual modality facilitate model to generate well-aligned part features. ProFD first designs part-specific prompts and utilizes noisy segmentation mask to preliminarily align visual and textual embedding, enabling the textual prompts to have spatial awareness. Furthermore, to alleviate the noise from external masks, ProFD adopts a hybrid-attention decoder, ensuring spatial and semantic consistency during the decoding process to minimize noise impact. Additionally, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we employ a self-distillation strategy, retaining pre-trained knowledge of CLIP to mitigate over-fitting. Evaluation results on the Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-ReID, and P-DukeMTMC datasets demonstrate that ProFD achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality (VR) treatments as either immersive virtual reality (IVR) or non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) in comparison to conventional therapy (CT) in improving physical and psychological status among stroke patients. METHODS: The literature search was conducted on seven databases. ACM Digital Library, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus. The effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen's d. Pooled results were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated that immersive virtual reality improved upper limb activity, function and activity of daily life in a way comparable to CT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper limb activity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and participation. A comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb training and activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. However, there is no evidence of the durability of IVR treatment. More research involving studies with larger samples is needed to assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of immersive virtual reality technology.</description>

      <title>FreeMask: Rethinking the Importance of Attention Masks for Zero-Shot Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have made remarkable advancements. Driven by their ability to generate temporally coherent videos, research on zero-shot video editing using these fundamental models has expanded rapidly. To enhance editing quality, structural controls are frequently employed in video editing. Among these techniques, cross-attention mask control stands out for its effectiveness and efficiency. However, when cross-attention masks are naively applied to video editing, they can introduce artifacts such as blurring and flickering. Our experiments uncover a critical factor overlooked in previous video editing research: cross-attention masks are not consistently clear but vary with model structure and denoising timestep. To address this issue, we propose the metric Mask Matching Cost (MMC) that quantifies this variability and propose FreeMask, a method for selecting optimal masks tailored to specific video editing tasks. Using MMC-selected masks, we further improve the masked fusion mechanism within comprehensive attention features, e.g., temp, cross, and self-attention modules. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing zero-shot video editing frameworks with better performance, requiring no control assistance or parameter fine-tuning but enabling adaptive decoupling of unedited semantic layouts with mask precision control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeMask achieves superior semantic fidelity, temporal consistency, and editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Retrieval: A Systematic Review of Methods and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the exponential surge in diverse multi-modal data, traditional uni-modal retrieval methods struggle to meet the needs of users seeking access to data across various modalities. To address this, cross-modal retrieval has emerged, enabling interaction across modalities, facilitating semantic matching, and leveraging complementarity and consistency between heterogeneous data. Although prior literature has reviewed the field of cross-modal retrieval, it suffers from numerous deficiencies in terms of timeliness, taxonomy, and comprehensiveness. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of cross-modal retrieval's evolution, spanning from shallow statistical analysis techniques to vision-language pre-training models. Commencing with a comprehensive taxonomy grounded in machine learning paradigms, mechanisms, and models, the paper delves deeply into the principles and architectures underpinning existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Furthermore, it offers an overview of widely-used benchmarks, metrics, and performances. Lastly, the paper probes the prospects and challenges that confront contemporary cross-modal retrieval, while engaging in a discourse on potential directions for further progress in the field. To facilitate the ongoing research on cross-modal retrieval, we develop a user-friendly toolbox and an open-source repository at https://cross-modal-retrieval.github.io.</description>

      <title>WorldGPT: Empowering LLM as Multimodal World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World models are progressively being employed across diverse fields, extending from basic environment simulation to complex scenario construction. However, existing models are mainly trained on domain-specific states and actions, and confined to single-modality state representations. In this paper, We introduce WorldGPT, a generalist world model built upon Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). WorldGPT acquires an understanding of world dynamics through analyzing millions of videos across various domains. To further enhance WorldGPT's capability in specialized scenarios and long-term tasks, we have integrated it with a novel cognitive architecture that combines memory offloading, knowledge retrieval, and context reflection. As for evaluation, we build WorldNet, a multimodal state transition prediction benchmark encompassing varied real-life scenarios. Conducting evaluations on WorldNet directly demonstrates WorldGPT's capability to accurately model state transition patterns, affirming its effectiveness in understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex scenarios. We further explore WorldGPT's emerging potential in serving as a world simulator, helping multimodal agents generalize to unfamiliar domains through efficiently synthesising multimodal instruction instances which are proved to be as reliable as authentic data for fine-tuning purposes. The project is available on \url{https://github.com/DCDmllm/WorldGPT}.</description>

      <title>Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.</description>
