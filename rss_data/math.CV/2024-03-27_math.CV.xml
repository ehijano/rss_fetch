      <title>A Dimca-Greuel type inequality for foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation at $p\in \mathbb{C}^2$, and $B$ be a separatrix of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove the following Dimca-Greuel type inequality $\frac{\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)}{\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)}&lt;4/3$, where $\mu_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the multiplicity of $\mathcal{F}$ along $B$ and $\tau_p(\mathcal{F},B)$ is the dimension of the quotient of $\mathbb{C}[[x,y]]$ by the ideal generated by the components of any $1$-form defining $\mathcal{F}$ and any equation of $B$. As a consequence, we provide a new proof of the $\frac{4}{3}$-Dimca-Greuel's conjecture for singularities of irreducible plane curve germs, with foliations ingredients, that differs from those given by Alberich-Carrami\~nana, Almir\'on, Blanco, Melle-Hern\'andez and Genzmer-Hernandes but it is in line with the idea developed by Wang.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert metric for bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded symmetric domains carry several natural invariant metrics, for example the Carath\'eodory, Kobayashi or the Bergman metric. We define another natural metric, from generalized Hilbert metric defined in [FGW20], by considering the Borel embedding of the domain as an open subset of its dual compact Hermitian symmetric space and then its Harish-Chandra realization in projective spaces. We describe this construction on the four classical families of bounded symmetric domains and compute both this metric and its associated Finsler metric. We compare it to Carath\'eodory and Bergman metrics and show that, except for the complex hyperbolic space, those metrics differ.</description>

      <title>On the length of lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2295</link>
      <description>arXiv:0805.2295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a monic polynomial p of degree d, the length of the level set {z: |p(z)|=1} is at most 9.2 d, which improves an earlier estimate due to P. Borwein. For d=2 we show that the extremal level set is the Bernoullis' Lemniscate. One ingredient of our proofs is the fact that for an extremal polynomial this level set is connected.</description>

      <title>A note on Rational Functions with three branched points on the Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the existence of rational functions with given branched data is a classical problem in the field of complex analysis and algebraic geometry. This problem dates back to Hurwitz and remains open to this day. In this paper, we utilize complex analysis to establish a property of rational functions with three branched points on the Riemann sphere. As applications, we present some new types of exceptional branched data. These results cover some previous results mentioned in \cite{EKS84,PP06,Zhu19}. We also establish the existence of a certain type of rational functions on the Riemann sphere.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval on circles and lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such that $|f|=|g|$ on a set $A$. We first prove that there exists $c$ in the unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in $\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$. The same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and $A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not. We also provide sequential versions of the previous results and analyse the case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally we examine the situation when there is equality on two distinct circles in the disc, proving a result or counterexample for each possible configuration.</description>

      <title>Classical values of Zeta, as simple as possible but not simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short note for non-experts means to demystify the tasks of evaluating the Riemann Zeta Function at non-positive integers and at even natural numbers, both initially performed by Leonhard Euler. Treading in the footsteps of G. H. Hardy and others, I re-examine Euler's work on the functional equation for the Zeta function, and explain how both the functional equation and all `classical' integer values can be obtained in one sweep using only Euler's favorite method of generating functions. As a counter-point, I also present an even simpler argument essentially due to Bernhard Riemann, which however requires Cauchy's residue theorem, a result not yet available to Euler. As a final point, I endeavor to clarify how these two methods are organically linked and can be taught as an intuitive gateway into the world of Zeta functionology.</description>

      <title>Free energy expansions of a conditional GinUE and large deviations of the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a planar Coulomb gas ensemble of size $N$ with the inverse temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.</description>
