      <title>A note on thermal effects in non-linear models for plasma-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-negligible background temperature on relativistic plasma wakefields generated when a beam of charged particles passes through a neutral plasma at rest. Our analysis focuses on the blowout regime, where the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed neglecting plasma temperature. In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the bubble in terms of its transversal and longitudinal sizes as a function of the temperature. Model predictions and parametrizations are studied in combination with PIC simulations, and correctly reproduce the temperature induced contraction of both the longitudinal and transverse bubble sizes.</description>

      <title>Difference in Neoclassical Edge Flows Between Strongly Negative and Positive Triangularities in the XGC Gyrokinetic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neoclassical baseline study of a strongly negative triangularity (NT) plasma and the corresponding positive triangularity plasma is performed using the edge-specialized, total-f gyrokinetic code XGC. A DIII-D-like plasma is used, based on the negative triangularity discharge of DIII-D \#193793. An artificial positive triangularity (PT) equilibrium has been constructed to compare the edge rotation physics at the same triangularity strength, but with opposite sign, while keeping the same elongation and other geometric parameters. Carbon(+6) ions are added to the deuterium plasma at an experimentally relevant level. By using the experimental profile of carbon toroidal rotation profile as an input, XGC finds that the deuteron rotation is significantly different from the carbon rotation at the inboard and outboard midplanes, mostly caused by the difference in the Pfirsch-Schluter rotation. More importantly, significant difference in the X-point orbit loss physics, thus the rotation source, is found between the positive and negative triangularity equilibrium models. However, it is also found that the agreement between the present neoclassical simulation and the experimental NT data is validated only within the middle of pedestal slope, indicating the importance of edge turbulence. This study could establish baseline for the multiphysics, multiscale studies that include turbulence of negative triangularity plasmas.</description>

      <title>Deposition rate and energy to substrate in chopped and standard HiPIMS: identifying optimal pulse parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) offers higher ionized flux fractions at the cost of lower deposition rates compared to conventional DCMS. A fine optimization of the deposition conditions is crucial for specific applications. Chopped or multi-pulse HiPIMS (segmenting pulses into shorter micropulses) has been proposed to mitigate ion back-attraction and promote working gas recovery. This study investigates how micropulse length, delay time between segments, and magnetic field strength influence energy flux, deposition rate, and ionized flux fraction in chopped and standard HiPIMS. These quantities are evaluated by passive thermal probe, biasable QCM and mass spectrometer measurements at the substrate position. Deposition-averaged and pulse-averaged power is kept constant for all conditions to facilitate meaningful comparison. Results indicate that chopping the HiPIMS pulse consistently leads to higher energy flux and total deposition rate compared to standard HiPIMS at the same total pulse length, primarily due to increased ion flux. A weaker unbalanced magnetic field configuration enhances deposition rates and ion transport. In chopped HiPIMS, increasing micropulse length decreased energy flux and deposition rates, whereas increasing the delay time between micropulses substantially improved these parameters. Importantly, standard HiPIMS, which operated at higher frequencies and short pulse lengths, demonstrated superior performance (with higher total energy and particle fluxes) than chopped HiPIMS when compared at similar short pulse durations. This suggests that consistent short pulse durations and sufficient off-times for complete gas refill are paramount for maximizing ion fluxes and deposition rates.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Lower Hybrid Drift Instability in Reconnecting Current Sheets Using a Hybrid Kinetic Model (ssV Code)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear evolution of the lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) in reconnecting current sheets using a hybrid kinetic simulation model implemented in the Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code. The model treats ions kinetically and electrons with a drift-kinetic approximation, solving self-consistent coupled electrostatic and electromagnetic fields. A parametric study explores the effects of mass ratio, temperature ratio, plasma beta, and sheet thickness. In electrostatic cases, LHDI remains localized at the sheet edges, flattening density gradients. In electromagnetic regimes, turbulence induced by LHDI generates magnetic perturbations that kink the current sheet and enhance anomalous resistivity. These dynamics may facilitate fast magnetic reconnection under certain conditions. Our results bridge prior theoretical predictions and simulations, emphasizing the importance of kinetic instabilities in reconnection physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Complexity Measures for Analysis of Solar Wind Structures and Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic collisionless model of the solar transition region and corona with spatially intermittent heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional kinetic model of the solar transition region and corona in which the plasma above the chromosphere is collisionless and embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Heating occurs intermittently at discrete locations on the chromospheric surface, modeled through a surface coarse-graining procedure that produces non-thermal boundary conditions for the Vlasov equation. The resulting stationary distribution functions generate suprathermal particle populations and naturally lead to a temperature inversion via gravitational filtering, without any local coronal heating. The model reproduces realistic temperature and density profiles with a thin transition region and a hot corona, consistent with solar observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial intermittency of heating at the chromospheric interface is sufficient to account for the formation of the transition region and the high-temperature corona.</description>

      <title>Electron Capture and Bound-State $\beta$ Decays in Ions and Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new theory describing the variation of electron capture and bound-state $\beta$-decays in atomic ions and (non) local thermodynamic equilibrium ((N)LTE) plasmas. We adopt the Takahashi-Yokoi nuclear model with added corrections to first calculate the decay rate for each atomic configuration of the isotope, and then evaluate the in-plasma decay rate by combining them with the charge state distribution (CSD) consistent with plasma density and temperature. Our approach expands the thermodynamic parameter space in which in-plasma $\beta$-decays can be studied, opening the possibility to validate the model in low-density laboratory magnetoplasmas before application to stellar nucleosynthesis. The model is explained using $^{7}$Be, and then applied to higher mass isotopes such as $^{140}$Pr$^{0+,57+,58+}$, $^{142}$Pm$^{0+,59+,60+}$ and $^{163}$Dy$^{66+}$. Our model is therefore amenable to isotopes in a wide range of masses, in both single charge state or in a plasma-generated CSD.</description>

      <title>Wave Topology in Hall MHD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) extends ideal MHD by incorporating the Hall effect via the induction equation, making it more accurate for describing plasma behavior at length scales below the ion skin depth. Despite its importance, a comprehensive description of the eigenmodes in HMHD has been lacking. In this work, we derive the complete spectrum and eigenvectors of HMHD waves and identify their underlying topological structure. We prove that the HMHD wave spectrum is homotopic to that of ideal MHD, consisting of three distinct branches: the slow magnetosonic-Hall waves, the shear Alfv\'en-Hall waves, and the fast magnetosonic-Hall waves, which continuously reduce to their ideal MHD counterparts in the limit of vanishing Hall parameter. Contrary to a recent claim, we find that HMHD does not admit any additional wave branches beyond those in ideal MHD. The key qualitative difference lies in the topological nature of the HMHD wave structure: it exhibits nontrivial topology characterized by a Weyl point-an isolated eigenmode degeneracy point-and associated nonzero Chern numbers of the eigenmode bundles over a 2-sphere in k-space surrounding the Weyl point.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of a RF-RF hybrid plasma torch with argon at atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>
