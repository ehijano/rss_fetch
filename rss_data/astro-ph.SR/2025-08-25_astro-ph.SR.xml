      <title>Identification of Nonlinear Damping of Transverse Loop Oscillations by KHI-induced Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kink oscillations in coronal loops have been extensively studied for their potential contributions to coronal heating and their role in plasma diagnostics through coronal seismology. A key focus is the strong damping of large-amplitude kink oscillations, which observational evidence suggests is nonlinear. However, directly identifying the nonlinearity is a challenge. This work presents an analytic formula describing nonlinear standing kink oscillations dissipated by turbulence, characterised by a time-varying damping rate and period drift. We investigate how the damping behaviour depends on the driving amplitude and loop properties, showing that the initial damping time $\tau$ is inversely proportional to the velocity disturbance over the loop radius, $V_i/R$. Using MCMC fitting with Bayesian inference, the nonlinear function better fits an observed decaying kink oscillation than traditional linear models, including exponential damping, suggesting its nonlinear nature. By applying a Bayesian model comparison, we establish regimes in which nonlinear and linear resonant absorption mechanisms dominate based on the relationship between the damping rate $\tau/P$ and $V_i/R$. Additionally, analysis of two specific events reveals that while one favours the nonlinear model, the other is better explained by the linear model. Our results suggest that this analytical approximation of nonlinear damping due to turbulence provides a valid and reliable description of large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations in coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Extreme Lithium Depletion in Solar Twins: Challenging Non-Standard Mixing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium (Li) is a powerful tracer of stellar mixing, gradually depleted in solar twins by non-standard transport below the convective zone. Here, we identify six new solar twins with exceptionally low Li levels that are not explained by current non-standard mixing models and, together with our previously reported anomalous solar twin HIP 8522, suggest a distinct population marked by a violent evolutionary past. Employing high-resolution spectra ($R=60,000 - 165,000$), we infer precise stellar parameters and chemical compositions, including Li abundances. We consider possible scenarios generating enhanced mixing, including planetary engulfment, blue straggler stars (BSSs), and early episodic accretion. Our planet engulfment simulations indicate that only one star may have engulfed an exoplanet, rapidly depleting Li via thermohaline convection. In the BSS scenario, radial velocity data rule out binary mass transfer, revealing no stellar companions but instead two new exoplanets. If these stars are field BSSs, a binary merger is likely though uncertain given that current BSS models focus mostly on stars in open clusters. Using pre-main-sequence episodic accretion models, we find that solar-mass stars can experience enhanced Li depletion without significant beryllium (Be) depletion. This is consistent with the Be abundances measured in two of our stars and represents the most plausible scenario, pending Be measurements for the remaining stars. These unique stars, together with HIP 8522, represent exceptional cases for testing stellar evolution models and probing internal mixing processes in Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Massive extended streamers feed high-mass young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars are born in a variety of environments that determine how they gather gas to achieve their final masses. It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate sufficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</description>

      <title>What do we mean by stellar mass? The impact of the pre-main sequence on the mass to light ratio of young and intermediate age stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis models are an essential tool with which galaxy physical parameters are extracted from observations. However they are built on assumptions designed for use in the local Universe, and not always appropriate to high redshift galaxies. Here we consider the impact of including the hitherto-neglected stellar pre-main sequence delay timescale on the interpretation of composite stellar populations at ages of &lt;1 Gyr. We find that doing so has an impact on the optical luminosity of very young stellar populations of up to ~10 per cent, although smaller changes in observed light (&lt;5 per cent) are expected in most use cases. However the impact on the inferred stellar mass and mass-to-light ratios is significant (a factor of 2 or more), depending on how those properties are defined. We find that the short time scales for star formation in the distant Universe require a clearer definition for the stellar mass in a population, and will impact assumptions about the inferred shape of the stellar initial mass function from observations.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Exoplanet Internal Structure Constraints Enabled by Comprehensive Host Star Characterization Reveal that Terrestrial Planets in Mean-motion Resonances are Water Rich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet mass and radius inferences fundamentally rely on host star mass and radius inferences. Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and elemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal structure constraints, published constraints have often been based on inferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial exoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution spectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically self-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as elemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these data plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to derive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets. We find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial exoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly lower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in our sample. Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards from more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to the incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their formation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions. We propose that they are both the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes and associate their low densities with the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen, helium, water, and/or other volatiles in their interiors. We verify that our results are independent of stellar parameter and elemental abundance inference approach and therefore robust.</description>

      <title>Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions in Galactic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the prospects for studying scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI) using the neutrino burst from a Galactic supernova. SNSI modify the resonant flavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and may be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We show that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense supernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their mass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the neutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense environments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova neutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders of magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Parametric and Magnetorotational Instabilities in Oscillatory Shear Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems, this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end, we perform three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study, we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows that resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI, and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases, we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>

      <title>Double Compact Binary Merger Rate Density in Open Star Clusters: Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and White Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: Studying compact-object binary mergers in star clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamical interactions in galaxies. Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation on the scattering coefficients of solar radio wave propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio waves undergo scattering by small-scale density fluctuations during propagation through the solar-terrestrial environment, substantially affecting the observed characteristics of solar radio bursts. This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.</description>

Abstract: There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description>

      <title>The Alma catalogue of OB stars. III. A cross-match with Gaia DR3 and an extension based on new spectral classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>
