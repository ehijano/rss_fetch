      <title>A theory of time based on wavefunction collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-General-Relativity I: a Non-Commutative GR Theory with the $\kappa$-Minkowski Spacetime as its Flat Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a twist deformation on infinitesimal diffeomorphisms to study a modification of General Relativity on a non-commutative spacetime extending the local $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. This non-commutative spacetime is present in Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) theories, where a fundamental length is relativistically incorporated into Special Relativity as an effective description of Quantum Gravity near Planckian energy scales. To avoid mathematical and physical ambiguities, such as the inability to twist-deform the Poincar\'e symmetry group such that $\kappa$-Minkowski becomes its covariant spacetime, we propose a novel approach to DSR and non-commutative theories, twisting the Dilatation-enlarged IGL(3,1) group and constructing deformed General Relativity accordingly. Physically, we interpret this as minimally modifying classical relativistic physics to accommodate quantum effects solely through spacetime uncertainties in a relativistic manner, a possibility new to DSR theories. These tools open the way to developing the dynamic sector of DSR, which would allow for predictions testable by astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Merger Rate with Modified Gravity in Dark-Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of modified gravity on the merger rate of compact binaries within dark-matter spikes surrounding super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Specifically, we calculate binary merger rates involving primordial black holes (PBHs) and/or neutron stars (NSs) in Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) gravity, with three SMBH mass functions, Benson, Vika, and Shankar. The results show consistently higher merger rates predicted for PBH-PBH and PBH-NS binaries in these gravity models compared to general relativity (GR), in particular at lower SMBH masses and for steeper dark-matter spike density profiles. The predicted merger rates are compared to the LIGO-Virgo observations to constrain the parameters of the theory. In particular we find steeper dark-matter spike density profiles in the modified gravity scenarios compared to GR. When compared to current observational constraints on PBH abundance, the mass ranges allowed by Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models are found to be wider than by nDGP models, for given merger rates. The results are highly dependent on the choice of SMBH mass function, with Vika and Shankar mass functions predicting lower abundances. The considerable sensitivity of the results on the assumed gravity scenario and SMBH mass function demonstrates the necessity of incorporating the corresponding theoretical uncertainties in making relatively robust predictions on compact binary merger rates and, as a result on PBH properties.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the growth index parameters in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyse constraints on the growth index of matter perturbations, $\gamma$, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, using recent cosmological observations, at the background and the perturbation levels, including Pantheon$^{+}$, Cosmic Chronometer (CC), and Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) datasets. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the distortion parameter, which measures the deviation of the $f(Q)$ gravity model from the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at the background level. Specifically, we investigate two cases of the growth index parameter: a constant $\gamma$ and a time-varying $\gamma(z)$. We investigate various parametrizations of the growth index $\gamma$, expressed as $\gamma = \gamma_{0} +\gamma_{1} y(z)$, where the function $y(z)$ assumes different forms, including constant ($\Gamma_{0}$), Taylor expansion around $z = 0$ ($\Gamma_{1}$), Taylor expansion around the scale factor ($\Gamma_{2}$), and an exponential form ($\Gamma_{3}$). By employing the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion, we find that the combined Pantheon$^{+}$+ CC+ RSD datasets impose stringent constraints on the value of the growth index. For the $\Gamma_{0}$ model, our results indicate that within the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, $\gamma$ is constrained to $0.545 \pm 0.096$, showing strong agreement with the theoretical expectation of $\gamma_{\Lambda} = \frac{6}{11}$. However, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, we observe $\gamma = 0.571^{+0.095}_{-0.110}$, slightly exceeding the $\Lambda$CDM value by 4.66 $\%$. Furthermore, when considering a time-varying growth index, our analysis reveals that the range of $\gamma_{0}$ spans from $0.596$ to $0.62$ across the $\Gamma_{1-3}$ models.</description>

      <title>Imprints of dark matter on the structural properties of minimally deformed compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the possibility of constructing anisotropic dark matter compact stars motivated by the Einasto density profile. This work develops analytical solutions for an anisotropic fluid sphere within the framework of the well-known Adler-Finch-Skea metric. This toy model incorporates an anisotropic fluid distribution that includes a dark matter component. We use the minimal geometric deformation scheme within the framework of gravitational decoupling to incorporate anisotropy into the pressure profile of the stellar system. In this context, we model the temporal constituent of the $\Theta$-field sector to characterize the contribution of dark matter within the gravitational matter source. We present an alternative approach to studying anisotropic self-gravitating structures. This approach incorporates additional field sources arising from gravitational decoupling, which act as the dark component. We explicitly verify whether the proposed model satisfies all the requirements for describing realistic compact structures in detail. We conclude that the modeling of the Einasto density model with the Adler-Finch-Skea metric gives rise to the formation of well-behaved and viable astrophysical results that can be employed to model the dark matter stellar configurations.</description>

      <title>Compact star in noninteger power model of $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate compact stars in the noninteger power (NIP) model of $f(R)$ gravity theory, which includes the higher-curvature correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The mass-radius relation of the compact stars in the NIP model predicts large deviations from those in the general relativity in the low-mass region, potentially allowing us to test the NIP model by future astrophysical observations. We also study the nonvanishing scalar hair surrounding the compact star and demonstrate that the chameleon mechanism works efficiently. They result in distinct scalar profiles inside and outside the star, which implies screening the fifth force mediated by the scalar field.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Possibility of Testing the No-Hair Theorem with Minkowski-deformed Regular Hairy Black Holes Via Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical appearance of a regular static spherically symmetric hairy black hole within the context of Minkowski deformation governed by the parameter \(\alpha\). This black hole describes a hairy black hole with geometric deformations in the radial and temporal metric components, parameterized by \(\alpha\). The optical appearance of the black hole, illuminated by a static thin accretion disk in three toy emission function models, exhibits distinctive shadows and photon rings. Our findings reveal that for static spherically symmetric hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black holes, the event horizon radius \(r_h\), photon sphere radius \(r_{ph}\), critical impact parameter \(b_{ph}\), and innermost stable circular orbit radius \(r_{isco}\) all have a positive correlation with \(\alpha\). These parameters affect the null geodesic trajectories, shadows, and the optical appearance of the photon rings illuminated by a static thin accretion disk around the black hole. Utilizing this, we obtained the optical appearance of this black hole when observed in the forward direction of the optical and geometric thin accretion disk models. In all three models, the radius of the photon ring images also shows a positive correlation with the parameter \(\alpha\). Therefore, under the static spherically symmetric hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black hole, there is no degeneracy of photon rings dependent on the parameter \(\alpha\). Theoretically, this allows for the distinction of different spacetime metrics of hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black holes, providing a potential method for testing the no-hair theorem through future observations of black hole photon rings.</description>

      <title>Timelike virtual transition in a static atom by a static mirror in Kasner Universe and in future Kruskal-Szekeres region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the timelike transitions in a two-level atom in the presence of an infinite reflecting mirror in the Kasner regions of a Minkowski spacetime as well as region interior of a $(1+1)$ dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, when considering the Kasner spacetime, two specific scenarios are dealt with -- $(i)$ a static mirror is synchronized with Minkowski time while the static atom is using future Kasner time, $(ii)$ a static atom is using Minkowski time and the mirror is following the future Kasner time. Analogous scenarios in the black hole spacetime are -- the static mirror is using future Kruskal time while the static atom is using Schwarzschild timelike coordinate, defined inside the black hole, as its time, and vice-versa. In all of these scenarios, we observe thermal response and its periodic dependence on the separation between the atom and the mirror. These responses vanish periodically with this separation, which contrasts the scenario of uniform acceleration. We observe that the $(1+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner responses are the same when the atomic and field frequencies are equal. At the same time, the Schwarzschild-interior and $(3+1)$ dimensional Minkowski-Kasner are unequal for the same atomic and field frequencies. Therefore we feel that the robustness of the symmetry between the two scenarios crucially depends on the dimension as well as the curvature of the spacetime. Although qualitatively, there exist similarities to a certain degree between the responses in the Minkowski-Kasner and Schwarzschild-interior, they also carry crucial differences. We discuss the physical interpretations of these observations.</description>

      <title>BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Gowdy symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of bounces, as predicted by Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL), as an instability mechanism within the setting of the Einstein vacuum equations in Gowdy symmetry. In particular, for a wide class of inhomogeneous initial data we prove that the dynamics near the $t = 0$ singularity are well-described by ODEs reminiscent of Kasner bounces. Unlike previous works regarding bounces, our spacetimes are not necessarily spatially homogeneous, and a crucial step is proving so-called asymptotically velocity term dominated (AVTD) behaviour, even in the presence of nonlinear BKL bounces and other phenomena such as spikes. (A similar phenomenon involving bounces and AVTD behaviour, though not spikes, can also be seen in our companion paper "BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field in surface symmetry", albeit in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model in surface symmetry.) One particular application is the study of (past) instability of certain polarized Gowdy spacetimes, including some Kasner spacetimes. Perturbations of such spacetimes are such that the singularity persists, but the intermediate dynamics -- between initial data and the singularity -- feature BKL bounces.</description>

      <title>BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field in surface symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of bounces, as predicted by Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) in the study of singularities arising from Einstein's equations, as an instability mechanism within the setting of the (inhomogeneous) Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system in surface symmetry. This article can be viewed as a companion to our other article "BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Gowdy symmetric spacetimes" [27], where we study bounces for the Einstein vacuum equations in Gowdy symmetry. That is, we show many features of such bounces generalize to the matter model described, albeit in a different symmetry class. The articles may be read independently.
  In analogy to [27], we describe a wide class of inhomogeneous initial data which permit formation of a spacelike singularity, but such that the dynamics towards different spatial points at the singularity are well-described by independent nonlinear ODEs reminiscent of BKL bounces. A major ingredient is the proof of so-called Asymptotically Velocity Term Dominated behaviour even in the presence of such bounces, though one difference from [27] is that our model does not permit the existence of so-called "spikes".
  One particular application is the study of (past) instability of certain generalized Kasner spacetimes with no electromagnetic field present. Perturbations of such spacetimes are such that the singularity persists, but for perturbations with electromagnetism turned on the intermediate dynamics - between data and the singularity - features up to one BKL-like bounce. This is in analogy with the instability of polarized Gowdy spacetimes due to non-polarized perturbations in [27].</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Superheavy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational production of superheavy scalar fields with nonminimal coupling during and after inflation. We derive analytical approximations using the mode function solution in a de Sitter background and also apply the steepest descent method. We study both positive and negative nonminimal couplings and show that their comoving number density spectra behave differently in the short and long wavelength regimes. We numerically compute the comoving number density spectra and dark matter abundance for a broad range of superheavy spectator fields exceeding the Hubble scale during inflation, with $m_{\chi} &gt; H_I$, and nonminimal couplings ranging from $-300 \leq \xi \leq 300$. When computing the allowed dark matter parameter space, we impose the maximum reheating temperature constraint, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraint, and the isocurvature constraint. We show that the presence of a positive or negative coupling $\xi$ can expand the parameter space up to $3$ orders of magnitude above the Hubble inflationary scale, allowing such dark matter candidates to be as heavy as $\sim 10^{16} \, \rm{GeV}$ in the Starobinsky model of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow the classical Double Copy (DC) procedure that links Yang-Mills and Double Field Theory (DFT), and we apply it on a four-derivative gauge theory which is known to be related to Weyl gravity at the level of the amplitudes. We obtain a perturbative T-duality invariant theory on a double geometry, or Conformal Double Field Theory (CDFT), incorporating Weyl gravity plus $b$-field and dilaton contributions at quadratic order, without the need to impose a gauge fixing condition. We also extend the formulation to cubic order for the case of vanishing generalized dilaton, which still incorporates Weyl gravity when $\Box h_{\mu \nu}=h=0$. CDFT, together with ordinary DFT, are examples of T-duality invariant theories constructed through classical DC maps, revealing a promising and deep connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant models.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Force and Inverted Harmonic Potential for Rapid Creation of Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [1]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [2]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wavepackets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of $10^{-15}$ kg and a size of 50 $\mu$m is realized in $0.1$ seconds. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using path integral approach.</description>

      <title>Exponential Expansion of Massive Schr\"{o}dinger Cats for Sensing and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger cat states of levitated masses have several applications in sensing and, offer an avenue to explore the fundamental nature -- classical vs nonclassical -- of gravity, eg, through gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). The interaction between a qubit and a levitated mass is a convenient method to create such a cat state. The size of the superpositions is limited by weak mass-qubit interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a protocol that exponentially expands an initially small superposition via Gaussian dynamics and successfully recombines it to complete an interferometry. An unknown force can be sensed by the superposition exponentially fast in the expansion time. The entanglement between two such interferometers interacting via a quantum force is -- for the first time in qubit-based non-Gaussian protocols -- obtained by solving the full quantum dynamics using Gaussian techniques. GIE grows exponentially, thereby making it closer to experimental feasibility. Requirements of experimental precision and decoherence are obtained.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations with ultralight vector dark matter fields: numerical implementation in CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a dark matter candidate described by an ultralight vector field, whose mass is in principle in the range $H_{\rm{eq}}\sim 10^{-28}\rm{eV}\ll m&lt; \rm{eV}$. The homogeneous background vector field is assumed to point in a given direction. We present a numerical implementation of cosmological perturbations in a Bianchi type I geometry with vector field dark matter in a modified version of the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS). We study the evolution of large-scale cosmological perturbations in the linear regime. We compute the matter power spectrums defined for Fourier modes pointing in a given direction. We obtain interesting features in the power spectrums whose observational significance depends on the field mass. We compare the results with the standard $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ and with the corresponding well-studied ultralight scalar field dark matter case. As for the scalar case we obtain a suppression in the power spectrums at small scales characterized by the same scale, namely the Jeans scale. The main characteristic feature of the vector field model we notice here for first time is that the amplitude of the suppression effect depends on the direction of the Fourier modes with respect to the background vector field, leaving eventually a possible anisotropic imprint in structure formation at small scales.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Black hole X-ray spectra: notes on the relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a collection of notes to calculate electromagnetic spectra of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks around black holes. The presentation is intentionally pedagogical and most calculations are reported step by step. In the disk-corona model, the spectrum of a source has three components: a thermal component from the disk, a Comptonized component from the corona, and a reflection component from the disk. These notes review only the relativistic calculations. The formulas presented here are valid for stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically-flat, circular spacetimes, so they can be potentially used for a large class of black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sydney Coleman's Q-ball remains a compelling instance of localised object formation within classical field theory, independently of the quantum evolution. The theoretical possibility of such objects forming and colliding in the early universe from models such as Affleck-Dine fragmentation, or from a number of mechanisms where they are produced copiously with various size and charges to be dark matter candidates, makes it important to study in detail Q-ball collision phenomenology. In this work we present results from a study of Q-ball collisions and their gravitational waves, using a new general code package for scalar fields coupled to gravity. We then comment on the possibility of future gravitational wave detectors searching for signals of Q-ball collisions.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Rotating Charged Nariai Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr-Newman black holes in a de Sitter space have the limit of rotating Nariai black holes with the near-horizon geometry of a warped ${\rm dS}_3 \times {\rm S}^1/Z_2$ when the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon coincide or approach close to each other. We study the effect of rotation on the emission of charges in the near-extremal rotating charged Nariai black hole and compare it to those from the near-extremal Nariai black hole and near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in de Sitter space. The emission has an exponential amplification for charges with high energy and becomes catastrophic when the two horizons are very close to each together. The angular momentum of black holes decreases the mean number of charges by a factor not by an order. We observe a catastrophic emission of boson condensation for charges with the effective energy equal to the chemical potential in the spacelike outer region of the cosmological horizon. Further, the rotating charged Nariai black holes can evolve into singular spacetimes with a naked singularity by the Schwinger pair production.</description>

      <title>Selective Amplification of a Gravitational Wave Signal Using an Atomic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel principle for quantum sensing of gravitational waves by exploiting the collective radiative dynamics of a one-dimensional array of atoms to selectively amplify a gravitational wave signal against the incoherent and collective Minkowskian contributions. We find that, in contrast to a single atom, the collective radiative dynamics of the array is sensitive to the gravitational wave at first order in its amplitude. We demonstrate that the effective number of atoms cooperating to sense the gravitational wave scales linearly with the total number of participating atoms, up to an upper limit. As a result, the imprint of the gravitational wave in the emission rate of the array scales nearly quadratically with the number of participating atoms. Additionally, this contribution to the radiative dynamics of the array involves coherent photon emission with well-defined directionality and at frequencies shifted by the frequency of the incident gravitational wave. We discuss the feasibility of this scheme in light of current and near-future experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermal and non-thermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the width of the scattering cross-section is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the scattering cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. The validity of this result arises from the fact that the bulk dual of entanglement entropy and the string vertices both are intrinsic hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of spinning deformed Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. To efficiently measure the effective tidal deformability parameter, we exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer during the late-inspiral. Thus, we indicate to a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within seconds before the merger. We report our observations for \texttt{GW170817} and explore the suitability of our approach in the upcoming observation scenarios of the current and the future ground-based observatories. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers in prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes modeled by the Kerr metric are not semiclassically self-consistent at or below the inner horizon. The renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a scalar quantum field in the Unruh state has been found to diverge at the Kerr inner horizon [arXiv:2203.08502], causing the geometry to backreact in a non-trivial way. In an effort to understand this backreaction, here the inner-horizon RSET is computed for the full physically relevant parameter space of black hole spins $a$ and polar angles $\theta$. Then, the backreaction is analyzed using a framework for the dynamical behavior of mass inflation from continued accretion. It is shown that the initial backreaction from the RSET does not evolve the spacetime toward any known regular or extremal configuration, but instead it brings the local interior geometry toward a chaotic, spacelike singularity, classically stable over astrophysical timescales.</description>

Abstract: In rotating black hole background surrounded by dark matter, we investigated the super-radiant phenomenon of massive scalar field and its associated instability.Using the method of asymptotic matching, we computed the amplification factor of scalar wave scattering to assess the strength of super-radiance. We discussed the influence of dark matter density on amplification factor in this black hole background. Our result indicates that the presence of dark matter has suppressive influence on black hole super-radiance. We also computed the net extracted energy to further support this result. Finally, we analyzed the super-radiant instability caused by massive scalar field using the black hole bomb mechanism and found that the presence of dark matter has no influence on the super-radiant instability condition.</description>

      <title>Time arrow without past hypothesis: a toy model explanation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The laws of Physics are time-reversible, making no qualitative distinction between the past and the future -- yet we can only go towards the future. This apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion. We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death. The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum improvement of Kerr black holes with mass-dependent scale identifications in asymptotically safe gravity. We find that a physically sensible identification can only be a function of $Mr$ and the area $A=4\pi(r^2+a^2)$ where $M$ is the mass of the black hole and $a$ is an angular momentum parameter. We then discuss various properties of the rotating quantum black holes for a simple choice of the identification. We show that the resulting regular rotating black holes have the following nice properties: (i) admitting a consistent black hole thermodynamics at the horizon, (ii) resolving the ring singularity, (iii) partially eliminating closed time-like curves present in the classical Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Can the angular scale of cosmic homogeneity be used as a cosmological test?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In standard cosmology, the cosmic homogeneity scale is the transition scale above which the patterns arising from non-uniformities -- such as groups and clusters of galaxies, voids, and filaments -- become indistinguishable from a random distribution of sources. Recently, different groups have investigated the feasibility of using such a scale as a cosmological test and arrived at different conclusions. In this paper, we complement and extend these studies by exploring the evolution of the spatial (${\cal{R}}_H$) and angular ($\theta_H$) homogeneity scales with redshift, assuming a spatially flat, $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter %($\Lambda$CDM) universe and linear cosmological perturbation theory. We confirm previous results concerning the non-monotonicity of ${\cal{R}}_H$ with the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ but also show that it exhibits a monotonical behavior with the Hubble constant $H_0$ within a large redshift interval. More importantly, we find that, for $z \gtrsim 0.6$, the angular homogeneity scale not only presents a monotonical behavior with $\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ but is quite sensitive to $H_0$, especially at higher redshifts. These results, therefore, raise the possibility of using $\theta_H$ as a new, model-independent way to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of self-replicating universes in black holes formed by dark matter-seeded stellar collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>High priority targets for transient gravitational waves from glitching pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glitching pulsars are expected to be important sources of gravitational waves. In this paper, we explore six different models that propose the emission of transient continuous waves, lasting days to months, coincident with glitches. The maximal gravitational wave energy is calculated for each model, which is then used to determine whether associated gravitational waves could be detectable with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O4 detectors. We provide an analytical approximation to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio which includes information about the source's sky position, improving on previous estimates that assume isotropic or sky and orientation averaged sensitivities. By analysing the entire glitching population, we find that certain models predict detectable signals in O4, whereas others do not. We also rank glitching pulsars by signal-to-noise ratio, based on archival data, and we find that for all models, the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835$-$4510) would provide the strongest signal. Moreover, PSR J0537$-$6910 is not expected to yield a detectable signal in O4, but will start becoming relevant for next generation detectors. Our analysis also extends to the entire pulsar population, regardless of whether they have glitched, and we provide a list of pulsars that would present a significant signal, if they were to glitch. Finally, we apply our analysis to the April 2024 Vela glitch and find that a signal should be detectable under certain models. The non-detection of a supposedly detectable signal would provide an efficiency factor that quantifies a model's contribution to gravitational wave emission, eventually leading to a differentiation of models and independent constraints on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Assisted Metropolis-Hastings for Bayesian Estimation of Critical Exponent on Elliptic Black Hole Solution in 4D Using Quantum Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the critical gravitational collapse produces continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine the solutions in the domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We develop a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on quantum perturbation theory to find the distribution of the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solution and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <title>Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological constraints allow primordial black holes (PBHs) to constitute dark matter in the mass range of 10^{18}-10^{22}g. We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than ~5x10^{-14} solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>
