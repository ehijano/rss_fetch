      <title>Galilei covariance of the theory of Thouless pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thouless theory of quantum pumps establishes the conditions for quantized particle transport per cycle, and determines its value. When describing the pump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform, though not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and time, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different formalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on Bloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will be realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply the bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation law within B\"uttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.</description>

      <title>(Twisted) canonical supermultiplets and their resolutions as open-closed homotopy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that some supersymmetric multiplets can naturally be equipped with the structure of an open-closed homotopy algebra. This structure is readily described through the pure spinor superfield formalism, which in particular associates a canonical multiplet for each choice of supersymmetry algebra. We study the open-closed homotopy algebra associated to (twists of) (resolutions of) the canonical multiplet, and show that it fits into a span of open-closed homotopy algebras, extending results of Cederwall et al. arXiv:2304.01258.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent manuscript~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a candidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here, we elegantly demonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are square-integrable and, crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. The latter represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On some minimal characteristics in a model of a system of N particles with interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the well-known model of a system of N particles with interaction (N-body problem), we consider the spatial problem of finding the minimum of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space under conditions on its size and angular momentum. Based on the solution to this problem, we prove that the minimum possible kinetic energy of a system at the current value of its size can be achieved only on flat trajectories of the system. And under some natural additional conditions these trajectories are flat finite and periodic (elliptical) trajectories generated by flat central configurations. The solution to this problem also provides a simpler solution to a similar optimization dual problem of finding the minimum of the size of a system under conditions on its kinetic energy and angular momentum. This leads to a similar result that the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy can also be achieved only on flat trajectories. Under some additional conditions these trajectories are also flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by flat central configurations. Next, we consider the more complex spatial problem of finding local minima of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space at fixed values of the integrals of motion: angular momentum and total energy of a system. Based on the solution of this problem, we prove further that under some natural additional conditions the local minima of the system kinetic and potential energy functions at fixed values of these integrals of motion can be achieved only on flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by some flat central configurations. And at the points of these local minima the minimum possible kinetic energy of the system at the current value of its size and the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy are also achieved.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus of quantum channels for the holomorphic discrete series of $SU(1,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13083v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor product of two holomorphic discrete series representations of $SU(1,1)$ can be decomposed as a direct sum of infinitely many discrete series. I shall introduce equivariant quantum channels for each component of the direct sum, mapping bounded operators on one factor of the tensor product to operators on the component. Next I prove a limit formula for the trace of the functional calculus and I prove that the limit can be expressed using generalized Husimi functions or using Berezin transforms.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry constraints on deformed 4d (S)CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequence of generalized symmetries in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. First, we classify all possible supersymmetric gauge theories with a simple gauge group that have a nontrivial one-form symmetry and flows to a superconformal field theory. Upon identifying unbroken discrete zero-form symmetries from the ABJ anomaly, we find that many of these theories have mixed zero-form/one-form 't Hooft anomalies. Then we classify the relevant deformations of these SCFTs that preserve the anomaly. From this mixed anomaly together with the anomalies of the discrete zero-form symmetries, we find obstructions for the relevant deformations of these SCFTs to flow to a trivially gapped phase. We also study non-Lagrangian SCFTs formed by gauging copies of Argyres-Douglas theories and constrain their deformations. In particular, we explore a new duality between the diagonal gauging of two $\mathcal{D}_3(SU(N))$ theories and $SU(N)$ gauge theory with two adjoints. We also repeat our analysis for a host of non-supersymmetric gauge theories having nontrivial one-form symmetry including examples that appear to flow to Bank-Zaks type CFTs.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable quantum field theory, in the sense that the correlation functions in an arbitrary background can be determined exactly using only the constraints of unitarity and crossing symmetry. For example, the three point correlation functions are given by the famous formula of Dorn-Otto-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (DOZZ). Unlike many other exactly solvable theories, Liouville theory has a continuously tunable parameter -- essentially $\hbar$ -- which is related to the central charge of the theory. Here we investigate the nature of the perturbative expansion in powers of $\hbar$, which is the loop expansion around a semi-classical solution. We show that the perturbative coefficients grow factorially, as expected of a Feynman diagram expansion, and take the form of an asymptotic series. We identify the singularities in the Borel plane, and show that they are associated with complex instanton solutions of Liouville theory; they correspond precisely to the complex solutions described by Harlow, Maltz, and Witten. Both single- and multi-valued solutions of Liouville appear. We show that the perturbative loop expansions around these different saddle points mix in the way expected for a trans-series expansion. Thus Liouville theory provides a calculable example of a quantum field theory where perturbative and instanton contributions can be summed up and assembled into a finite answer.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar electrodynamics in the braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and study its perturbative expansion in the algebraic framework of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We confirm that UV/IR mixing is absent at one-loop order in this noncommutative field theory, and that the non-anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities for the braided gauge symmetry are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Existence of One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking and phase transition in the Ising pure $p$-Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) for the mean field Ising spin glasses at finite temperature and verify the first part of Gardner's conjecture. Specifically, Gardner conjectured that for Ising pure $p$-spin glasses with $p\geq 3,$ there are two phase transitions: the Parisi measure is Replica Symmetric (RS) at high temperatures, then transitions to One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1RSB) at a lower temperature, and finally reaches Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) at very low temperatures. Our main results verify the first part of the Gardner transition: for any $p \geq 3,$ there exists a unique $\beta^p_1&gt;0$ such that the Parisi measure is RS for $0 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_{1}$ and then 1RSB for $\beta^p_1 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_1+\epsilon_p$ with some $\epsilon_p&gt;0.$</description>

      <title>The Lake equation as a supercritical mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study so-called supercritical mean-field limits of systems of trapped particles moving according to Newton's second law with either Coulomb/super-Coulomb or regular interactions, from which we derive a $\mathsf{d}$-dimensional generalization of the Lake equation, which coincides with the incompressible Euler equation in the simplest setting, for monokinetic data. This supercritical mean-field limit may also be interpreted as a combined mean-field and quasineutral limit, and our assumptions on the rates of these respective limits are shown to be optimal. Our work provides a mathematical basis for the universality of the Lake equation in this scaling limit -- a new observation -- in the sense that the dependence on the interaction and confinement is only through the limiting spatial density of the particles. Our proof is based on a modulated-energy method and takes advantage of regularity theory for the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalised-geometric formulation of 10-dimensional supergravity suggests a particular simple "limit", which results in a theory whose only dynamical degrees of freedom are the dilaton and the dilatino. The theory is still invariant both under generalised diffeomorphisms and a local supersymmetry and in many aspects is structurally similar to the original supergravity, which makes it a convenient playground for understanding more subtle aspects of the full physical setup. In particular, the simplicity and the geometric nature of the dilatonic theory allow us to build a full BV extension to all orders in the fermionic variables.</description>

      <title>Preparing angular momentum eigenstates using engineered quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled angular momentum eigenstates are widely used in atomic and nuclear physics calculations, and are building blocks for spin networks and the Schur transform. To combine two angular momenta $\mathbf{J}_1$ and $\mathbf{J}_2$, forming eigenstates of their total angular momentum $\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{J}_1+\mathbf{J}_2$, we develop a quantum-walk scheme that does not require inputting $O(j^3)$ nonzero Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefficients classically. In fact, our scheme may be regarded as a unitary method for computing CG coefficients on quantum computers with a typical complexity of $O(j)$ and a worst-case complexity of $O(j^3)$. Equivalently, our scheme provides decompositions of the dense CG unitary into sparser unitary operations. Our scheme prepares angular momentum eigenstates using a sequence of Hamiltonians to move an initial state deterministically to desired final states, which are usually highly entangled states in the computational basis. In contrast to usual quantum walks, whose Hamiltonians are prescribed, we engineer the Hamiltonians in $\mathfrak{su}(2)\times \mathfrak{su}(2)$, which are inspired by, but different from, Hamiltonians that govern magnetic resonances and dipole interactions. To achieve a deterministic preparation of both ket and bra states, we use projection and destructive interference to double pinch the quantum walks, such that each step is a unit-probability population transfer within a two-level system. We test our state preparation scheme on classical computers, reproducing CG coefficients. We also implement small test problems on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Network to the Solutions of Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a promising research direction in the field of solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Dealing with singular perturbation problems continues to be a difficult challenge in the field of PINN. The solution of singular perturbation problems often exhibits sharp boundary layers and steep gradients, and traditional PINN cannot achieve approximation of boundary layers. In this manuscript, we propose the General-Kindred Physics-Informed Neural Network (GKPINN) for solving Singular Perturbation Differential Equations (SPDEs). This approach utilizes asymptotic analysis to acquire prior knowledge of the boundary layer from the equation and establishes a novel network to assist PINN in approximating the boundary layer. It is compared with traditional PINN by solving examples of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and time-varying SPDE equations. The research findings underscore the exceptional performance of our novel approach, GKPINN, which delivers a remarkable enhancement in reducing the $L_2$ error by two to four orders of magnitude compared to the established PINN methodology. This significant improvement is accompanied by a substantial acceleration in convergence rates, without compromising the high precision that is critical for our applications. Furthermore, GKPINN still performs well in extreme cases with perturbation parameters of ${1\times10}^{-38}$, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Global derivation of the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation from quantum many-body dynamics with screened Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 1D quantum many-body dynamics with a screened Coulomb potential in the mean-field setting. Combining the quantum mean-field, semiclassical, and Debye length limits, we prove the global derivation of the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation. We tackle the difficulties brought by the pure state data, whose Wigner transforms converge to Wigner measures. We find new weighted uniform estimates around which we build the proof. As a result, we obtain, globally, stronger limits, and hence the global existence of solutions to the 1D Vlasov-Poisson equation subject to such Wigner measure data, which satisfy conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, despite being measure solutions. This happens to solve the 1D case of an open problem regarding the conservation law of the Vlasov-Poisson equation raised in [18] by Diperna and Lions.</description>

      <title>Time splitting and error estimates for nonlinear Schrodinger equations with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>One other parameterization of SU(4) group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a special decomposition of the Lie $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra into the direct sum of orthogonal subspaces, $\mathfrak{su}(4)=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{a}\oplus\mathfrak{a}^\prime\oplus\mathfrak{t}\,,$ with $\mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and a triplet of 3-dimensional Abelian subalgebras $(\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{a}^{\prime}, \mathfrak{t})\,,$ such that the exponential mapping of a neighbourhood of the $0\in \mathfrak{su}(4)$ into a neighbourhood of the identity of the Lie group provides the following factorization of an element of $SU(4)$ \[ g = k\,a\,t\,, \] where $k \in \exp{(\mathfrak{k})} = SU(2)\times SU(2) \subset SU(4)\,,$ the diagonal matrix $t$ stands for an element from the maximal torus $T^3=\exp{(\mathfrak{t})},$ and the factor $a=\exp{(\mathfrak{a})}\exp{(\mathfrak{a}^\prime)}$ corresponds to a point in the double coset $SU(2)\times SU(2)\backslash SU(4)/T^3.$
  Analyzing the uniqueness of the inverse of the above exponential mappings, we establish a logarithmic coordinate chart of the $SU(4)$ group manifold comprising 6 coordinates on the embedded manifold $ SU(2)\times SU(2) \subset SU(4)$ and 9 coordinates on three copies of the regular octahedron with the edge length $2\pi\sqrt{2}\,$.</description>

      <title>Dual overlaps and finite coupling 't Hooft loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable $su(2\vert2)_{c}$ symmetric models have integrable boundaries with $osp(2\vert2)$ symmetries, which can be embedded into $su(2\vert2)_{c}$ in two different ways. We dualize the previously obtained asymptotic overlap formulas for one of the embeddings to describe the other embedding and apply the results to describe the asymptotic expectation values of local operators in the presence of a 't Hooft line in N=4 SYM. A peculiar feature of the setting is that in certain gradings only descendant states have non-vanishing overlaps with the boundary state and the overlap formula is not factorized for the Bethe roots.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of a vortex-based superconducting memory cell: dynamics and geometrical optimization of a fluxonic quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of dense random-access memory is one of the main obstacles to the development of digital superconducting computers. It has been suggested that AVRAM cells, based on the storage of a single Abrikosov vortex, the smallest quantized object in superconductors, can enable drastic miniaturization to the nanometer scale. In this work, we present numerical modeling of such cells using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The cell represents a fluxonic quantum dot containing a small superconducting island, an asymmetric notch for vortex entrance, a guiding track, and a vortex trap. We determine the optimal geometrical parameters for operation at zero magnetic field and the conditions for controllable vortex manipulation by short current pulses. We report ultra-fast vortex motion with velocities more than an order of magnitude faster than those expected for macroscopic superconductors. This phenomenon is attributed to strong interactions with the edges of a mesoscopic island, combined with the nonlinear reduction of flux-flow viscosity due to nonequilibrium effects in the track. Our results show that such cells can be scaled down to sizes comparable to the London penetration depth, 100 nm, and can enable ultrafast switching on the picosecond scale with ultra-low energy per operation, 0.1 aJ.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

One can substitute `gapped' for `projectively topological'. Our proofs use evaluations of a field theory in parametrized families.</description>

As an application I show how the relation can be used to quickly prove normalization identities for the Weyl function, and apply the result to Weyl magic and Wigner magic as the generalization of the recently suggested Renyi Stabilizer entropy to q-dits and CV.</description>

Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) a tighter continuity relation for quantum capacity; (4) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (5) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (6) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (7) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>

Abstract: We present the Bogoliubov's causal perturbative QFT, which includes only one refinement: the creation-annihilation operators at a point, \emph{i.e.} for a specific momentum, are mathematically interpreted as the Hida operators from the white noise analysis. We leave the rest of the theory completely unchanged. This allows avoiding infrared -- and ultraviolet -- divergences in the transition to the adiabatic limit for interacting fields. We present here the analysis of the causal axioms for the scattering operator with the Hida operators as the creation-annihilation operators.</description>

      <title>On Yang-Mills Stability Bounds and Plaquette Field Generating Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Yang-Mills (YM) QFT with group $U(N)$. We take a finite lattice regularization $\Lambda\subset a\mathbb Z^d$, $d = 2,3,4$, with $a\in (0,1]$ and $L$ (even) sites on a side. Each bond has a gauge variable $U\in U(N)$. The Wilson partition function is used and the action is a sum of gauge-invariant plaquette (minimal square) actions times $a^{d-4}/g^2$, $g^2\in(0,g_0^2]$, $0&lt;g_0^2&lt;\infty$. A plaquette action has the product of its four variables and the partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann factor with a product of $U(N)$ Haar measures. Formally, when $a\searrow 0$ our action gives the usual YM continuum action. For free and periodic b.c., we show thermodynamic and stability bounds for a normalized partition function of any YM model defined as before, with bound constants independent of $L,a,g$. The subsequential thermodynamic and ultraviolet limit of the free energy exist. To get our bounds, the Weyl integration formula is used and, to obtain the lower bound, a new quadratic global upper bound on the action is derived. We define gauge-invariant physical and scaled plaquette fields. Using periodic b.c. and the multi-reflection method, we bound the generating function of $r-$scaled plaquette correlations. A normalized generating function for the correlations of $r$ scaled fields is absolutely bounded, for any $L,a,g$, and location of the external fields. From the joint analyticity on the field sources, correlations are bounded. The bounds are new and we get $a^{-d}$ for the physical two-plaquette correlation at coincident points. Comparing with the $a\searrow 0$ singularity of the physical derivative massless scalar free field two-point correlation, this is a measure of ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in the context of a lattice QFT. Our methods are an alternative and complete the more traditional ones.</description>

      <title>A Riemann-Hilbert approach to the two-component modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the Cauchy problem for the two-component modified Camassa-Holm (2-mCH) equation based on its Lax pair. Further via a series of deformations to the RH problem by using the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of Deift-Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations to the solutions of the 2-mCH equation in four kinds of space-time regions. Especially we introduce a technique to unify multi-jump matrix factorizations into one form which can greatly simplify the calculation of the $\bar{\partial}$-steepest descent method.</description>

      <title>Beyond directed hypergraphs: heterogeneous hypergraphs and spectral centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of hypergraphs has received a lot of attention over the past few years, however up until recently there has been no interest in systems where higher order interactions are not undirected. In this article we introduce the notion of heterogeneous hypergraphs from an algebraic point of view, which have traditional directed hypergraphs as a particular case. We furthermore analytically study the spectral centralities associated to some types of heterogeneous hypergraphs, extending previously defined eigenvector-like centrality measures to this new realm. We supplement the analytical arguments with some numerical comparisons of pairwise and higher order rankings, and we construct directed higher order networks from real data.</description>

      <title>Mean eigenvector self-overlap in deformed complex Ginibre ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a random matrix of size $N$ as an additive deformation of the complex Ginibre ensemble under a deterministic matrix $X_0$ with a finite rank, independent of $N$. We prove that microscopic statistics for the mean diagonal overlap, near the edge point, are characterized by the iterative erfc integrals, which only depend on the geometric multiplicity of certain eigenvalue of $X_0$. We also investigate the microscopic statistics for the mean diagonal overlap of the outlier eigenvalues. Further we get a phenomenon of the phase transition for the mean diagonal overlap, with respect to the modulus of the eigenvalues of $X_0$.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained. These identities allow us to derive the exact energy spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the system based on polynomial analysis. The present method provides a unified treatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and non-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Determinants from Schr\"odinger Type Equations, and Deformation of Tracy-Widom Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake an analysis of Fredholm determinants arising from kernels whose defining functions satisfy a Schr\"odinger type equation. When this defining function is the Airy one, the evaluation of the corresponding Fredholm determinant yields the notorious Tracy-Widom distribution [hep-th/9211141], which has found many applications in numerous domains. In this paper, we unveil a generalization of the Tracy-Widom distribution for a generic class of defining functions. Furthermore, we bring forth a direct application of our upshot and survey the relation between the framework which we employ and isomonodromic systems.</description>

      <title>Semigroup approach to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.09412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework based on the concept of the semigroup to understand the fermion sign problem. By using properties of contraction semigroups, we obtain sufficient conditions for quantum lattice fermion models to be sign-problem-free. Many previous results can be considered as special cases of our new results. As a direct application of our new results, we construct a class of sign-problem-free fermion lattice models, which cannot be understood by previous frameworks. This framework also provides an interesting aspect in understanding related quantum many-body systems. We establish a series of inequalities for all the sign-problem-free fermion lattice models that satisfy our sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Some Rigorous Results on the L\'evy Spin Glass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the L\'evy spin glass model, a fully connected model on $N$ vertices with heavy-tailed interactions governed by a power law distribution of order $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2.$ Our investigation is divided into three cases $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $\alpha=1$, and $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2.$ When $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2,$ we identify a high temperature regime, in which the limit and fluctuation of the free energy are explicitly obtained and the site and bond overlaps are shown to exhibit concentration, interestingly, while the former is concentrated around zero, the latter obeys a positivity behavior. At any temperature, we further establish the existence of the limiting free energy and derive a variational formula analogous to Panchenko's framework in the setting of the Poissonian Viana-Bray model. For $\alpha=1$, the free energy scales super-linearly and converges to a constant proportional to $\beta$ in probability at any temperature. In the case of $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, the scaling for the free energy is again super-linear, however, it converges weakly to the sum of a Poisson Point Process at any temperature. Additionally, we show that the Gibbs measure puts most of its mass on the configurations that align with signs of the polynomially many heaviest edge weights.</description>

      <title>On boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori for sequences of tori converging to the integer lattice. We prove that zeros are bounded for sequences of balanced tori, but unbounded for sequences of highly unbalanced tori. Here balanced means that the size of the torus is at most exponential in the shortest side length, while highly unbalanced means that the longest side length of the torus is super exponential in the product over the other side lengths cubed. We discuss implications of our results to the existence of efficient algorithms for approximating the independence polynomial on tori.
  This project was partially inspired by the relationship between zeros of partition functions and holomorphic dynamics, a relationship that in the last two decades played a prominent role in the field. Besides presenting new results, we survey this relationship and its recent consequences.</description>

      <title>First-principles construction of symmetry-informed quantum metrologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but the optimisation equations involved are often hard to solve. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.</description>

      <title>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya-Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\mathbb{N}$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e. quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller-Lieb-Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Complex Stochastic Optimal Control Foundation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies extend the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers when finding optimal controls. This paper explores the application of the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. It provides an in-depth investigation of the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We obtain the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. During the development of the covariant form of the HJB equation, we demonstrate that if the temporal stochastic increments of the two processes are perfectly correlated, then the spatial stochastic increments must be perfectly anti-correlated, and vice versa. The diffusion coefficient we derive has a form that enables the linearization of the HJB equation. The method for linearizing the HJB equation, along with the subsequent derivation of the Dirac equation, is developed in our previous work [V. Yordanov, Scientific Reports 14, 6507 (2024)]. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the application of stochastic optimal control theory to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>
