      <title>Compact Group Actions with the Tracial Rokhlin Property II: Examples and Nonexistence Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced the restricted tracial Rokhlin property with comparison, a ``tracial'' analog of the Rokhlin property for actions of second countable compact groups on infinite dimensional simple separable unital C*-algebras. In this paper, we give three classes of examples of actions of compact groups which have this property but do not have the Rokhlin property, or even finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers. One class consists of infinite tensor products of finite group actions with the tracial Rokhlin property, giving actions of the product of the groups involved. The second class consists of actions of the circle group on simple unital AT~algebras. The construction of the third class starts with an action of the circle on the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$ which has the restricted tracial Rokhlin property with comparison; by contrast, it is known that there is no action of this group on ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$ which has finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers. We can then tensor this action with the trivial action on any unital purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebra. One also gets such actions on certain purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras by tensoring the AT~examples with the trivial action on ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$; these are different.
  We also discuss other tracial Rokhlin properties for actions of compact groups, and prove that there is no direct limit action of the circle group on a simple AF~algebra which even has the weakest of these properties.</description>

      <title>A homotopy rigidity theorem for $\mathcal{Z}_0$-stable $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two simple, separable, nuclear and $\mathcal{Z}_0$-stable $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras are isomorphic if they are trace-preservingly homotopy equivalent. This result does not assume the UCT and can be viewed as a tracial stably projectionless analog of the homotopy rigidity theorem for Kirchberg algebras.</description>

      <title>Internal graphs of graph products of hyperfinite II$_1$-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for a graph $\Gamma$ from a class named H-rigid graphs, its subgraph ${\rm Int}(\Gamma)$, named the internal graph of $\Gamma$, is an isomorphism invariant of the graph product of hyperfinite II$_1$-factors $R_{\Gamma}$. In particular, we can classify $R_{\Gamma}$ for some typical types of graphs, such as lines and cyclic graphs. As an application, we also show that for two isomorphic graph products of hyperfinite II$_1$-factors over H-rigid graphs, the difference of the radius between the two graphs will not be larger than 1. Our proof is based on the recent resolution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture.</description>

      <title>Column bounded matrices and Grothendieck's inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It follows from Grothendieck's little inequality that to any complex (m x n) matrix X of column norm at most 1, and an 0 &lt;e &lt;1, there exist a natural number q, an (m x q) matrix C with
  $(1-e)^2 \leq CC^* \leq (4/\pi) (1 + e)^2$
  and an (q x n ) matrix Z with entries in the complex torus such that X= q$^{-(1/2)}$(CZ). Both of Grothendieck's complex inequalities follow from this factorization result.</description>

      <title>Gap-preserving reductions and RE-completeness of independent set games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP$^*$=RE (Ji et al., arXiv:2001.04383) shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP$^*$ is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP$^*$-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of almost PVMs to genuine PVMs.</description>
