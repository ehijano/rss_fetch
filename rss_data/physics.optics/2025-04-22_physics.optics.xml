      <title>Breaking the Diffraction Barrier for Passive Sources: Parameter-Decoupled Superresolution Assisted by Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parameter-decoupled superresolution framework for estimating sub-wavelength separations of passive two-point sources without requiring prior knowledge or control of the source. Our theoretical foundation circumvents the need to estimate multiple challenging parameters such as partial coherence, brightness imbalance, random relative phase, and photon statistics. A physics-informed machine learning (ML) model (trained with a standard desktop workstation), synergistically integrating this theory, further addresses practical imperfections including background noise, photon loss, and centroid/orientation misalignment. The integrated parameter-decoupling superresolution method achieves resolution 14 and more times below the diffraction limit (corresponding to ~ 13.5 nm in optical microscopy) on experimentally generated realistic images with &gt;82% fidelity, performance rivaling state-of-the-art techniques for actively controllable sources. Critically, our method's robustness against source parameter variability and source-independent noises enables potential applications in realistic scenarios where source control is infeasible, such as astrophysical imaging, live-cell microscopy, and quantum metrology. This work bridges a critical gap between theoretical superresolution limits and practical implementations for passive systems.</description>

      <title>DeepPD: Joint Phase and Object Estimation from Phase Diversity with Neural Calibration of a Deformable Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample-induced aberrations and optical imperfections limit the resolution of fluorescence microscopy. Phase diversity is a powerful technique that leverages complementary phase information in sequentially acquired images with deliberately introduced aberrations--the phase diversities--to enable phase and object reconstruction and restore diffraction-limited resolution. These phase diversities are typically introduced into the optical path via a deformable mirror. Existing phase-diversity-based methods are limited to Zernike modes, require large numbers of diversity images, or depend on accurate mirror calibration--which are all suboptimal. We present DeepPD, a deep learning-based framework that combines neural representations of the object and wavefront with a learned model of the deformable mirror to jointly estimate both object and phase from only five images. DeepPD improves robustness and reconstruction quality over previous approaches, even under severe aberrations. We demonstrate its performance on calibration targets and biological samples, including immunolabeled myosin in fixed PtK2 cells.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature high-average-power strong-field terahertz source based on industrial high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses, generated via optical rectification of femtosecond lasers in nonlinear crystals, are pivotal in various applications. However, conventional Ti:sapphire lasers struggle to produce high-average-power THz due to their limited output power. While kilowatt ytterbium lasers are increasingly adopted, their application in THz generation faces challenges: low optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (attributed to long pulse durations and low energy) and crystal damage under high pumping power. Here, we report a high-average-power strong-field THz source using a lithium niobate crystal pumped by a 1030-nm, 570-fs, 1-mJ, 50-kHz ytterbium femtosecond laser with tilted pulse front pumping (TPFP). By systematically optimizing TPFP implementations and comparing grating- and echelon-type configurations, we achieve a THz source with 64.5 mW average power at 42-W, 50-kHz pumping, and a focused peak electric field of 525 kV/cm at 0.83-mJ, 1-kHz operation. Additionally, we observe Zeeman torque signals in cobalt-iron ferromagnetic nanofilms. This high-repetition-rate, high-average-power THz system, combined with its potential capabilities in high signal-to-noise spectroscopy and imaging, promises transformative impacts in quantum matter manipulation, non-destructive testing, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlinear disordered photonic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of complex photonics has garnered significant interest due to its rich physics and myriad applications spanning physics, engineering, biology, and medicine. However, a substantial portion of research focuses primarily on the linear medium. Over the years, optical nonlinearity, particularly the second order denoted as $\chi^{(2)}$, has been harnessed for diverse applications such as frequency conversions, three-wave mixing, material characterizations, and bio-imaging. When $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinearity combines with the disorder, a new realm of physics emerges, which in the last 30 years has witnessed substantial progress in fundamental studies and futuristic applications. This review aims to explore fundamental concepts concerning $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear disordered media, chart the field's evolution, highlight current interests within the research community, and conclude with a future perspective.</description>

      <title>Focal control and light tracing on curved surfaces with isotropic transformation medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optics related to non-Euclidean geometry has been attracting growing interest for emerged novel phenomena and the analog for general relativity, while most studies are limited to the free space on rotationally-symmetric surfaces. In this paper, we focus on the light control and ray tracing on complex surfaces filled with inhomogeneous transformation medium. Within the conformal transformation optics, focal control devices and absolute optical instruments have been extended to curved surfaces. According to the equivalence between geometry and material, the metric tensor of the curved surface and the refractive index tensor are unified as the optical metric for the Hamilton's equations of light propagation on a curved surface. By solving for ray trajectories in the local coordinate system of mesh element and illuminating the refraction between non-planar elements with discontinuous media, a mesh-based ray-tracing algorithm on curved surface with medium has been proposed to validate the light control. Our research establishes a theoretical framework for light ray control in non-Euclidean space and offers an efficient tool for ray tracing in inhomogeneous medium on curved surface.</description>

      <title>Topological linear and nonlinear gap modes in defected dimer lattice with fourth-order diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical properties of linear and nonlinear topological in-phase, out-of-phase, and edge modes in a defected dimer lattice with fourth-order diffraction, encompassing their bifurcation characteristics, localized field distributions, and stability properties. Both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities are considered. Within the nontrivial regime, in-phase, out-of-phase, and edge modes can emerge within the gap. Numerical results reveal that three types of topological gap solitons bifurcate from their corresponding linear localized modes. The dimerization parameter can be tuned to drive the system from a trivial to a nontrivial configuration. We observe that as the strength of the fourth-order diffraction increases, the size of the spectral gap also enlarges, with this parameter effectively broadening the stability window for solitons. Our findings offer novel insights into the properties of both linear and nonlinear modes in topologically defected structures.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Light Field Modulation via Conjugate Phase Encoding in Liquid Crystal Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional light field modulation demands precise control over multiple optical parameters, a capability critical for next-generation photonic systems. While liquid crystals offer inherent advantages in dynamic birefringence tuning, existing approaches face fundamental limitations in decoupling interdependent phase responses across polarization states. Here, we demonstrate a conjugate phase encoding paradigm enabling simultaneous manipulation of wavelength-dependent wavefronts, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and polarization states in photoaligned liquid crystal devices.</description>

      <title>MetasurfaceViT: A generic AI model for metasurface inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, sub-wavelength artificial structures, can control light's amplitude, phase, and polar ization, enabling applications in efficient imaging, holograms, and sensing. Recent years, AI has witnessed remarkable progress and spurred scientific discovery. In metasurface design, optical inverse design has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach. It uses deep learning to create a nonlinear mapping between optical structures and functions, bypassing time-consuming traditional design and attaining higher accuracy. Yet, current deep-learning models for optical design face limitations. They often work only for fixed wavelengths and polarizations, and lack universality as input-output vector size changes may require retraining. There's also a lack of compatibility across different application scenarios. This paper introduces MetasurfaceViT, a revolutionary generic AI model. It leverages a large amount of data using Jones matrices and physics-informed data augmentation. By pre-training through masking wavelengths and polarization channels, it can reconstruct full-wavelength Jones matrices, which will be utilized by fine-tuning model to enable inverse design. Finally, a tandem workflow appended by a forward prediction network is introduced to evaluate performance. The versatility of MetasurfaceViT with high prediction accuracy will open a new paradigm for optical inverse design.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of ultrathin metamaterial absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic absorbers combining ultrathin profiles with robust absorptivity across wide incidence angles are essential for applications such as stealth technology, wireless communications, and quantum computing. Traditional designs, including Salisbury screens, typically require thicknesses of at least a quarter-wavelength (lambda/4), which limits their use in compact systems. While metamaterial absorbers (MMAs) can reduce thickness, their absorptivity generally decreases under oblique incidence conditions. Here, we introduce an adjoint optimization-based inverse design method that merges the ultrathin advantage of MMAs with the angle-insensitive characteristics of Salisbury screens. By leveraging the computational efficiency of the adjoint method, we systematically optimize absorber structures as thin as lambda/20. The optimized designs achieve absorption exceeding 90% at the target frequency of 7.5 GHz and demonstrate robust performance under oblique incidence, maintaining over 90% absorption up to 50{\deg}, approximately 80% at 60{\deg}, and around 70% at 70{\deg}. Comparative analysis against particle swarm optimization highlights the superior efficiency of the adjoint method, reducing computational effort by approximately 98%. This inverse design framework thus provides substantial improvements in both performance and computational cost, offering a promising approach for advanced electromagnetic absorber design.</description>

      <title>The universality of filamentation-caused challenges of ultrafast laser energy deposition in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light propagation in semiconductors is the cornerstone of emerging disruptive technologies holding considerable potential to revolutionize telecommunications, sensors, quantum engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides fabricated by femtosecond laser photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate on insulator (PPLNOI) ridge waveguides are critical photonic components for both classical and quantum information processing. However, dry etching of PPLNOI waveguides often generates rough sidewalls and variations in the etching rates of oppositely poled lithium niobate ferroelectric domains, leading a relatively high propagation losses (0.25 - 1 dB/cm), which significantly limits net conversion efficiency and hinders scalable photonic integration. In this work, a low-loss PPLNOI ridge waveguide with a length of 7 mm was fabricated using ultra-smooth sidewalls through photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching followed by high-voltage pulse poling. The average surface roughness was measured at just 0.27 nm, resulting in significantly lower propagation loss compared to dry-etched counterparts. Highly efficient second-harmonic generation was demonstrated with a normalized efficiency of 1742%/(W*cm^2) and an overall efficiency of 750.1%/W (without accounting for propagation loss). The absolute conversion efficiency reached 15.8%, representing a six-fold improvement over the best previously reported values in single-period PPLNOI waveguides without magnesium oxide doping.</description>

      <title>Beyond Terabit/s Integrated Neuromorphic Photonic Processor for DSP-Free Optical Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of generative AI drives unprecedented demands for high-performance computing. Training large-scale AI models now requires vast interconnected GPU clusters across multiple data centers. Multi-scale AI training and inference demand uniform, ultra-low latency, and energy-efficient links to enable massive GPUs to function as a single cohesive unit. However, traditional electrical and optical interconnects, relying on conventional digital signal processors (DSPs) for signal distortion compensation, increasingly fail to meet these stringent requirements. To overcome these limitations, we present an integrated neuromorphic optical signal processor (OSP) that leverages deep reservoir computing and achieves DSP-free, all-optical, real-time processing. Experimentally, our OSP achieves a 100 Gbaud PAM4 per lane, 1.6 Tbit/s data center interconnect over a 5 km optical fiber in the C-band (equivalent to over 80 km in the O-band), far exceeding the reach of state-of-the-art DSP solutions, which are fundamentally constrained by chromatic dispersion in IMDD systems. Simultaneously, it reduces processing latency by four orders of magnitude and energy consumption by three orders of magnitude. Unlike DSPs, which introduce increased latency at high data rates, our OSP maintains consistent, ultra-low latency regardless of data rate scaling, making it ideal for future optical interconnects. Moreover, the OSP retains full optical field information for better impairment compensation and adapts to various modulation formats, data rates, and wavelengths. Fabricated using a mature silicon photonic process, the OSP can be monolithically integrated with silicon photonic transceivers, enhancing the compactness and reliability of all-optical interconnects. This research provides a highly scalable, energy-efficient, and high-speed solution, paving the way for next-generation AI infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Probing Complex Decoherence Processes in Materials for Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary consideration in developing new material platforms for quantum applications is to optimize coherence. Despite its importance, decoherence processes remains challenging to experimentally interrogate and quantify. In this Perspective, we first introduce the concept of decoherence in quantum systems and conventional techniques to assess decoherence at optical frequencies. We then introduce multidimensional coherent spectroscopy as a unique probe capable of revealing the full complexity of decoherence dynamics in realistic circumstances. To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided.</description>

      <title>Inferring Structure via Duality for Photonic Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Led by a result derived from Sion's minimax theorem concerning constraint violation in quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) with at least one constraint bounding the possible solution magnitude, we propose a heuristic scheme for photonic inverse design unifying core ideas from adjoint optimization and convex relaxation bounds. Specifically, through a series of alterations to the underlying constraints and objective, the QCQP associated with a given design problem is gradually transformed so that it becomes strongly dual. Once equivalence between primal and dual programs is achieved, a material geometry is inferred from the solution of the modified QCQP. This inferred structure, due to the complementary relationship between the dual and primal programs, encodes overarching features of the optimization landscape that are otherwise difficult to synthesize, and provides a means of initializing secondary optimization methods informed by the global problem context. An exploratory implementation of the framework, presented in a partner manuscript, is found to achieve dramatic improvements for the exemplary photonic design task of enhancing the amount of power extracted from a dipole source near the boundary of a structured material region -- roughly an order of magnitude compared to randomly initialized adjoint-based topology optimization for areas surpassing $10~\lambda^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Dynamics in Entangled Biphoton Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum light spectroscopy highlight the potential of using entangled photons as a sensitive probe for many-body dynamics and material correlations. However, a comprehensive theory to explain experimental results remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the Hilbert space and the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in material systems. In this work, we introduce a tractable model based on a finite-sized correlation matrix governed by a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian, enabling efficient simulations through Gaussian-preserving dynamics. We apply this framework to compute the output joint spectral intensity (JSI) and von Neumann entropy of frequency-entangled biphotons, and find close agreement with experimental observations in empty microcavities. Our results reveal the emergence of off-diagonal spectral correlations that can be interpreted as irreversible decay of cavity excitations into the biphoton continua. This approach offers a powerful theoretical tool for interpreting quantum spectroscopic data and paves the way for probing more complex light-matter interactions in materials.</description>

      <title>Phase tomography with axial structured illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic Tomography (HT) or Optical Diffraction Tomography (ODT) provides slice-by-slice information about the refractive index (RI) of three-dimensional (3D) samples and is emerging as an important label-free imaging modality for Life sciences. HT systems go beyond the digital holographic microscopy (DHM) systems that provide a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the total accumulated phase acquired by a plane beam on transmission through a 3D sample. While the early HT systems used a direct reconstruction methodology based on the Fourier diffraction theorem, in recent years, there has been an increasing shift towards using iterative optimization frameworks for solving the 3D RI reconstruction problem. Despite this algorithmic framework shift, the HT system hardware still largely uses the multi-angle illumination geometries that were suitable for reconstructions based on the Fourier diffraction theorem. The present work examines the possibility of HT reconstruction through the use of on-axis structured illumination(s) that nominally illuminates the 3D sample along the axial direction. Through a simulation study, it is shown that a cross-talk free slice-by-slice 3D RI reconstruction of the sample is possible in this case via the use of sparsity penalties if the slice-to-slice distance obeys a design curve based on the notion of effective depth of focus. The simulation results for two-, three- and four-slice 3D objects with laterally overlapping features clearly outline the separate roles played by the slice-to-slice de-correlation of the field propagating through the 3D sample and that of the sparsity penalty used to guide the iterative solution. Our results suggest the possibility of realizing an Axial Structured Illumination Tomography (ASIT) system configuration that avoids the use of hardware-intensive multi-angle illumination geometry.</description>

      <title>Bulk photogalvanic current control and gap spectroscopy in 2D hexagonal materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials have been intensively explored for multiple optoelectronic applications such as spin current generation, all-optical valleytronics, and topological electronics. In the realm of strong-field and ultrafast light-driven phenomena, it was shown that tailored laser driving such as polychromatic or few-cycle pulses can drive robust bulk photogalvanic (BPG) currents originating from the K/K' valleys. We here explore the BPG effect in 2D systems in the strong-field regime and show that monochromatic elliptical pulses also generically generate such photocurrents. The resultant photocurrents exhibit both parallel and transverse (Hall-like) components, both highly sensitive to the laser parameters, providing photocurrent control knobs. Interestingly, we show that the photocurrent amplitude has a distinct behavior vs. the driving ellipticity that can be indicative of material properties such as the gap size at K/K', which should prove useful for novel forms of BPG-based spectroscopies. We demonstrate these effects also in benchmark ab-initio simulations in monolayer hexagonal boron-nitride. Our work establishes new paths for controlling photocurrent responses in 2D systems that can also be used for multi-dimensional spectroscopy of ultrafast material properties through photocurrent measurements.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Optic Fiber Interferometry in Forced Vibration Experimentation for Educational Purposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an experimental teaching method that employs optic fiber interferometry (OFI) to investigate forced vibration phenomena. It is designed for undergraduate physics majors with foundational mechanics and optics training and optics-focused graduate students. This approach aims to deepen students' understanding of forced vibration theory and interferometric measurement principles while fostering skills in experimental design, data analysis, and problem solving. Leveraging OFI's high-precision displacement measurement capabilities, the experiment enabled accurate tracking of frequency and displacement variations. By scanning the driving force frequency, students obtained amplitude frequency curves to determine the system's natural frequency, which closely aligned with theoretical predictions. This method may bridge theoretical concepts and practical applications, offering insights into teaching vibration theory and precision measurement techniques and equipping students with integrated knowledge for real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Photonic Qubit Gates via 1D Scattering from an Array of Two-Level Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computing offers a promising platform for quantum information processing, benefiting from the long coherence times of photons and their ease of manipulation. This paper presents a scheme for implementing a deterministic phase gate for dual-rail number encoded photonic qubits, leveraging a standard 1D waveguide coupled to an array of two-level emitters (TLE). Using a transfer matrix approach, we develop a protocol for deterministic phase gate operation, demonstrating its robustness against non-waveguide mode coupling and disorder. Finally, we relax the idealized assumption of monochromatic light, considering finite-bandwidth pulses. Despite these realistic considerations, our results indicate high fidelity for the proposed phase gate protocol. Finally we will discuss two qubit operations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical basis of measurement-device-independent quantum-key-distribution with asymmetric sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has been a promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the overall performance when two arbitrary and asymmetric sources the MDI users employ. As a specific application, we calculate the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare this result to the cases with symmetric sources. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources. Since requiring all users to employ identical sources in a network is unreasonable, our theory paves the way for the practical deployment of MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon processes are crucial in applications like microscopy and microfabrication, but their low cross-section requires intense illumination and limits, e.g., the penetration depth in nonlinear microscopy. Entangled states have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of two-photon interactions and have shown effectiveness at low intensities. This quantum enhancement is generally believed to be lost at high intensities, for more than one photon per mode, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explored experimentally and theoretically two-photon processes driven by entangled photons at intensities beyond this threshold and compared the results with the classical case. We found that a quantum advantage can still be observed at nearly one order of magnitude higher intensities than previously assumed. Our findings show a potential path for exploiting quantum-enhanced two-photon processes in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin orbit coupling gives rise to intriguing physical phenomena in bosonic condensates, such as formation of stripe phases and domains with vortex arrays. However, how the non-Hermiticity affects the spatial distribution of spin orbit coupled topological defects such as vortex pair is still challenging to study. In the present work, we realize a non-equilibrium room-temperature exciton polariton condensate within a microdisk potential in a liquid crystal (LC) microcavity with the perovskite CsPbBr3 as optically active material. We use the interplay of TE-TM mode splitting and Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC) to realize electrically tunable polariton vortex pairs with locked spin and orbital angular momentum. Importantly, the non-Hermiticity of RDSOC bands leads to nonreciprocal transportation of the vortex pair such that they move to the opposite edges of the microdisk depending on their spin. Our results are robust against sample imperfections and pave the way to investigate the coupling of vortex orbital and spin degrees of freedom in a quantum fluid of light at room temperature, offering potential for generation of complex states of light for non-Hermitian quantum optical information processing within optoelectronic chips.</description>

Abstract: The ease of using optical gain/loss provides a fertile ground for experimental explorations of non-Hermitian (NH) physics. Without gain/loss, can we realize the NH effect in a Hermitian system? The interface between the coupled Hermitian subsystems is a natural object for NH physics due to the nonconservative process on it. However, it is still far from enduing the interface with rich NH physics. Here, a junction between the topological insulator and the conductor is considered, where the interface can be effectively described by a NH Hamiltonian--such NH character is ascribed to the conductor self-energy of a reservoir. As a consequence of that, we show the wave propagation along the interface exhibits dissipative non-reciprocity (dubbed non-Bloch transport), which was believed to be unique in NH systems. Moreover, the meta-materialization of tight-binding models is also studied by identifying their equivalent connectivity, enabling us to demonstrate the above exotic NH behavior of the interface experimentally. Our work provides a conceptually rich avenue to construct NH systems for both optics and electronics.</description>

      <title>On-chip twisted hollow-core light cages: enhancing planar photonics with 3D nanoprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted optical fibers are a promising platform for manipulating circularly polarized light and orbital angular momentum beams for applications such as nonlinear frequency conversion, optical communication, or chiral sensing. However, integration into chip-scale technology is challenging because twisted fibers are incompatible with planar photonics and the achieved twist rates are limited. Here, we address these challenges by introducing the concept of 3D-nanoprinted on-chip twisted hollow-core light cages. We show theoretically and experimentally that geometrical twisting of light cages forces the fundamental core mode of a given handedness to couple with selected higher-order core modes, resulting in strong circular dichroism (CD). These chiral resonances result from the angular momentum harmonics of the fundamental mode, allowing us to predict their spectral locations and the occurrence of circular birefringence. Twisted light cages enable very high twist rates and CD, exceeding those of twisted hollow-core fibers by more than two orders of magnitude (twist period: 90 $\mu$m, CD: 0.8 dB/mm). Moreover, the unique cage design provides lateral access to the central core region, enabling future applications in chiral spectroscopy. Therefore, the presented concept opens a path for translating twisted fiber research to on-chip technology, resulting in a new platform for integrated chiral photonics.</description>

      <title>Radiation of surface polaritons by an annular beam coaxially enclosing a cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the radiation of surface polaritons by an annular beam that coaxially encloses a cylindrical waveguide surrounded by a homogeneous medium. By using the Green dyadic, the electromagnetic potentials and the electric and magnetic fields are found inside and outside the waveguide. The expression for the energy losses is derived for the general case of the dispersion for dielectric permittivities inside and outside the cylinder. A comprehensive analysis is presented in the spectral range corresponding to the radiation of surface polaritons. The highest peaks in the spectral distribution are obtained for intermediate values of the beam velocity. In the limit of transparent medium the spectrum of radiated surface polaritons is discrete and the corresponding frequencies are determined by the eigenvalue equation for the cylindrical waveguide. Numerical examples are presented for the Drude model of dispersion.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Customized, Low-Loss Optical Resonators by Combination of FIB-Milling and CO$_2$ Laser Ablation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabry-Perot cavities are essential tools for applications like precision metrology, optomechanics and quantum technologies. A major challenge is the creation of microscopic spherical mirror structures which allow the precise matching with the wavefront of a Gaussian beam, while providing high surface quality. We present a novel fabrication technique, enabling the creation of customized microscopic cavity mirror structures over a wide range of geometrical parameters, by combining focused ion beam milling (FIB) and CO$_2$ laser smoothing. While FIB milling allows us to imprint features on the mirror substrate with a resolution on the nanometer scale, the application of defocused CO$_2$ laser pulses consistently reduces remaining surface deformations down to a roughness of $\sigma_\text{RMS}=0.2\,$nm. The average deviation of the profile from a spherical shape is kept below a few nanometres. This technique enables the customized and repeatable fabrication of low loss optics on a wide range of optical substrates, including optical fibres. Thus, Fabry-Perot cavities can be fabricated with pre-defined modal volume, high finesse and tailored ellipticity. Since the structural shape of the mirror is created by FIB milling, its pixel-by-pixel nature of the writing process can be used to create arbitrary structures with a resolution given by the FIB milling. At the same time, the surface quality is given by the CO$_2$ laser smoothing processes, without degrading the FIB milled shape.</description>

      <title>Topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonic waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic driving is a powerful tool to generate exotic topological phases without static counterparts, such as the anomalous chiral edge modes from bulk bands with zero Chern number and topological $\pi$ modes exhibiting period-doubled dynamics. Recently, a new class of Floquet topological mode, namely the $\pi/2$ mode, which carries four-period periodicity and has potential applications in quantum computing, was proposed based on a square-root method and realized in an acoustic system. Here we propose a laser-written waveguide array lattice to realize topological $\pi/2$ modes in photonics. Our photonic model simulates a square-root periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and has a rich phase diagram allowing for the co-existence of conventional zero, $\pi$ modes, and the new $\pi/2$ modes. Through numerical simulations of the wave equation, we uncover the unique four-period evolution feature of the $\pi/2$ modes. Our model, which only contains four waveguides per unit cell and two driving steps, is easy to implement with current fabrication techniques and may find applications in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mode Enhancement in Coherent-harmonic Dual-comb Spectroscopy Enables Exceeding 300-fold Averaging Time Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) is a novel Fourier-transform spectroscopy not relying on mechanical scanning and capable of simultaneously achieving high speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth. Nevertheless, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single acquisition due to the dynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by the high-peak-power mode-locked pulses, making coherent averaging an essential means to improve SNR, at the price of compromising the exceptional time resolution and placing more stringent demands on mutual coherence and stability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to enhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement mechanism in coherent-harmonic pulses. As a proof-of-concept, we employ two frequency combs with mode spacing of $\sim$12.5 MHz, operating at a 20th harmonic repetition rate of $\sim$250 MHz, demonstrating a $&gt;$300-fold reduction in averaging time for comparable SNR in conventional DCS. This reduction is expected to be further enhanced through integration with ultra-high repetition rate combs like microresonator combs. This new approach promises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation of the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly facilitate subsequent DCS investigations and field deployments.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunnelling without a barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunneling is an iconic concept that captures the peculiarity of quantum dynamics but, despite its ubiquity, questions remain. We focus on strong-field tunneling, which is vital to all attosecond science. We find an unexpected optical tunneling event that happens when the instantaneous electric field vanishes and there is no barrier. This event arises from a color switchover in a strongly polychromatic field. The tunneling without a barrier reveals the disconnect between the standard intuition built on the picture of a quasistatic barrier and the nonadiabatic nature of the process.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>
