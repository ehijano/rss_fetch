      <title>Aspects of Propagator Sparsening in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lattice field theory, field sparsening aims to replace quantum fields, or objects constructed from them, with approximations that preserve the appropriate symmetries and maintain many aspects of the physics that the fields determine. For example, an effective sparsening of a quark propagator provides an efficient map from a quark propagator on a fine lattice geometry to a quark propagator defined on a coarser geometry in order to reduce storage and computational costs of subsequent calculational stages while maintaining long-distance correlations and corresponding low-energy physical information. Previous studies have focused on decimating lattice sites or randomly sampling lattice sites to reduce the size of the propagator and subsequent costs of Wick contractions. Here, we extend the study of sparsening to incorporate covariant averaging of spatial sites and examine the effects on two-point and three-point correlation functions involving various hadrons. We find that sparsening is most effective in reproducing the unsparsened versions of these correlation functions when weighted covariant-averaging is sequentially applied many times.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>Charmed meson masses and decay constants in the continuum from the tadpole improved clover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the determination of the charm quark mass, the masses, and decay constants of charmed mesons using thirteen 2+1 flavor gauge ensembles at five different lattice spacings $a\in[0.05,0.11]$ fm, 8 pion masses $m_{\pi}\in(130,360)$ MeV, and several values of the strange quark mass, which facilitate us to do the chiral and continuum extrapolation. These ensembles are generated through the stout smeared clover fermion action and Symanzik gauge actions with the tadpole improvement. By absorbing the discretization errors into the masses and field normalization of the charm quark, we manage to suppress the discretization error of the charmed meson mass and all the S-wave open charmed meson decay constants to a few percent or even less at lattice spacing \( a \sim 0.1 \) fm. Moreover, discretization errors for other quantities are also significantly reduced. The continuum extrapolated charm quark mass, $m_c(m_c)=1.2933(72)(95)$ GeV in $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, is determined using QED-subtracted $D_s$ meson mass and non-perturbative renormalization. Predictions of the open and close charm mesons using this charm quark mass agree with the experimental values at 0.1-0.5\% level uncertainty. We obtained $D_{(s)}$ decay constants and also by far the most precise $D_{(s)}^*$ decay constants $f_{D^*}=0.2292(26)(17)$ GeV and $f_{D^*_s}=0.2691(30)(03)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of finite-volume effect on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon g-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy spectrum relevant to the lattice calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment a_\mu is dominantly given by two-pion states satisfying L\"uscher's finite-volume quantization condition. Finite-volume effects from those states may exhibit power-law dependence on the volume, contrary to an exponential suppression as suggested by chiral effective theory. Employing the finite-volume state decomposition of Euclidean correlators, we systematically investigate the volume dependence. Phenomenological inputs are used for \pi\pi phase shift and time-like pion form factor. Our estimate for the finite-volume effects on a_\mu is larger than previous works and has a different volume scaling. Numerical results are given for the ``window'' observables of a_\mu.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector and scalar contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results for single axial-vector and scalar meson pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) part of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In the dispersive approach to these quantities (in narrow width approximation) the central inputs are the corresponding space-like electromagnetic transition form factors. We determine these directly using a functional approach to QCD by Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations in the very same setup we used previously to determine pseudo-scalar meson exchange ($\pi$, $\eta$ and $\eta'$) as well as meson ($\pi$ and $K$) box contributions. Particular care is taken to preserve gauge invariance and to comply with short distance constraints in both the form factors and the HLbL tensor. Our result for the contributions from a tower of axial-vector states including short distance constraints is { $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{AV-tower+SDC}] = 24.8 \,(6.1) \times 10^{-11}$}. For the combined contributions from $f_0(980), a_0(980), f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(1450)$ we find $a_\mu^{\text{HLbL}}[\text{scalar}] = -1.6 \,(5) \times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Four loop Green's functions involving the $n$ $=$ $2$ moment of the Wilson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the Green's function for the insertion of the second moment of the twist-$2$ flavour nonsinglet Wilson operator in a quark $2$-point function in all three different single scale external momentum configurations at four loops in the MSbar scheme and the chiral limit. One configuration is where the operator is inserted at zero momentum while the other two are where a non-zero momentum flows out through the operator itself with one external quark momentum nullified. In the latter two configurations mixing of the operator with a total derivative twist-$2$ operator is included for renormalization group consistency. In addition we compute the correlation functions of both gauge invariant operators to four loops in the same scheme.</description>

      <title>Gauge covariance of the gap equation: from the rainbow truncation to gauge symmetry constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge covariance of the quark gap equation is compared for three quark-gluon vertices: the bare vertex, a Ball-Chiu like vertex constrained by the corresponding Slavnov-Taylor identity, and a full vertex including the transverse components derived from transverse Slavnov-Taylor identities. The covariance properties are verified with the chiral quark condensate and the pion decay constant in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Lattice Effective Field Theory Simulations of Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice effective field theory applies the principles of effective field theory in a lattice framework where space and time are discretized. Nucleons are placed on the lattice sites, and the interactions are tuned to replicate the observed features of the nuclear force. Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to predict the properties of nuclear few- and many-body systems. We review the basic methods and several theoretical and algorithmic advances that have been used to further our understanding of atomic nuclei.</description>
