      <title>Dots and Boxes Algorithm for Peierls Substitution: Application to Multidomain Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields can be introduced into discrete models of quantum systems by the Peierls substitution. For tight-binding Hamiltonians, the substitution results in a set of (Peierls) phases that are usually calculated from the magnetic vector potential. As the potential is not unique, a convenient gauge can be chosen to fit the geometry and simplify calculations. However, if the magnetic field is non-uniform, finding a convenient gauge is challenging. In this work we propose to bypass the vector potential determination by calculating the Peierls phases exclusively from the gauge-invariant magnetic flux. The phases can be assigned following a graphic algorithm reminiscent of the paper and pencil game "dots and boxes". We showcase the method implementation by calculating the interference phenomenon in a modified Aharonov-Bohm ring and propose a phase assignation alternative to the Landau gauge to reproduce the Half Integer Quantum Hall Effect in graphene. A non-uniform magnetic field case is addressed by considering a multi-domain Chern insulator to study the effects of domain walls in resistance and current quantization. It is found that adding decoherence and a finite temperature into the model results in quantized resistances that are in good agreement with experiments made with multi-domain intrinsic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Quantum Valley Hall Effect with Quantized Resistance and a Topological Switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge states of a topological insulator can be used to explore fundamental science emerging at the interface of low dimensionality and topology. Achieving a robust conductance quantization, however, has proven challenging for helical edge states. Here we show wide resistance plateaus in kink states - a manifestation of the quantum valley Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene - quantized to the predicted value at zero magnetic field. The plateau resistance has a very weak temperature dependence up to 50 Kelvin and is flat within a dc bias window of tens of mV. We demonstrate the electrical operation of a topology-controlled switch with an on/off ratio of 200. These results demonstrate the robustness and tunability of the kink states and its promise in constructing electron quantum optics devices.</description>

      <title>Dual relaxation oscillations in a Josephson junction array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report relaxation oscillations in a one-dimensional array of Josephson junctions. The oscillations are circuit-dual to those ordinarily observed in single junctions. The dual circuit quantitatively accounts for temporal dynamics of the array, including the dependence on biasing conditions. Injection locking the oscillations results in well-developed current plateaux. A thermal model explains the relaxation step of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermodiffusion, absolute negative mobility and reverse heat transport in a single quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state transport characteristics of a quantum dot system consisting of a single energy level embedded between two reservoirs under the influence of both the temperature gradient and bias voltage. Within tailored parameter regimes, the system can exhibit three counterintuitive transport phenomena of anomalous thermodiffusion, absolute negative mobility and reverse heat transport respectively. These counterintuitive phenomena do not violate the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, absolute negative mobility and reverse heat transport can be identified by a reversible energy level. These anomalous transports are different from thermoelectric transports and provide different perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding of the transport characteristics of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Computation of Biological Conductance with Liouville Quantum Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that single proteins can display high conductivity, which stays finite for low temperatures, decays slowly with distance, and exhibits a rich spatial structure featuring highly conducting and strongly insulating domains. Here, we intruduce a new formula by combining the density matrix of the Liouville-Master Equation simulating quantum transport in nanoscale devices, and the phenomenological model of electronic conductance through molecules, that can account for the observed distance- and temperature dependence of conductance in proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy on experimentally highly conductive extracellular cytochrome nanowires, which are good candidates to illustrate our new approach by calculating and visualizing their electronic wiring, given the interest in the arrangement of their conducting and insulating parts. As proteins and protein nanowires exhibit significant potential for diverse applications, including energy production and sensing, our computational technique can accelerate the design of nano-bioelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Study of non-diffusive thermal behaviors in nanoscale transistors under different heating strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the phonon transport mechanisms and efficiently capturing the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in the electronic devices. Most previous simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating, and the effective Fourier's law (EFL) is widely used for practical multiscale thermal engineering due to its simplicity and efficiency although it still follows the diffusive rule. However, non-continuous heating is more common in the electronic devices, and few comparative study is conducted to estimate how much deviation the EFL would produce. To answer above questions, the heat conduction in nanoscale bulk or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors is investigated by the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under three heating strategies, namely, `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. Numerical results in the quasi-2D or 3D hotspot systems show that it is not easy to accurately capture the micro/nano scale heat conduction by the EFL, especially near the hotspot regions. Different heating strategies have great influence on the temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</description>

      <title>Role of Non-Hermiticity in d-wave Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop non-Hermitian counterpart of a new class of collinear magnets, dubbed altermagnets, delineated by net zero magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting bands. With the introduction of an imaginary gauge field in the hopping parameter of a two-dimensional d-wave altermagnet, we discover an inversion broken mixed phase featuring the coexistence of spin-momentum locked and unlocked spin polarized bands along with the altermagnetic order, without hosting exceptional points (EPs). By attaching a ferromagnetic lead with d-wave altermagnet, we uncover the emergence of two pairs of exceptional points, a hallmark signature of the non-Hermitian topology. Further, we demonstrate that the application of a planar magnetic field to the junction not only tune the location of the EPs but also can annihilate single pair or even all pairs of EPs depending on the field direction. Finally, we establish that the spin expectation value coalesces at the EPs, revealing its another fingerprint.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant optical selection rules for excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presently, the optical selection rules for excitons under circularly-polarized light are manifestly gauge-dependent. Recently, Fernando et al. introduced a gauge-invariant, quantized interband index. This index may improve the topological classification of material excited states because it is intrinsically an inter-level quantity. In this work, we expand on this index to introduce its chiral formulation, and use it to make the selection rules gauge-invariant. We anticipate this development to strengthen the theory of quantum materials, especially two-dimensional semiconductor photophysics.</description>

      <title>Free Standing Epitaxial Oxides Through Remote Epitaxy: The Role of the Evolving Graphene Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy has garnered considerable attention as a promising method that facilitates the growth of thin films that replicate the crystallographic characteristics of a substrate by utilizing two-dimensional (2D) material interlayers like graphene. The resulting film can be exfoliated to form a freestanding membrane, and the substrate, if expensive, can be reused. However, atomically thin 2-D materials are susceptible to damage before and during film growth in the chamber, leading to a poor epitaxy. Oxide remote epitaxy using graphene, the most commonly available 2D material, is particularly challenging because the conventional conditions employed for the growth of epitaxial oxides also degrade graphene. In this study, we show for the first time that a direct correlation exists between the microstructure of graphene, its getting defective on exposure to the pulsed laser deposition plume, and the crystalline quality of the barium titanate film deposited on top. A controlled aperture method was used to reduce graphene damage. Even so, the degree of damage is more at the graphene grain boundaries than within the grains. Large grain-sized greater than 300 microns, graphene suffered less damage and yielded a film comparable to that grown directly on a strontium titanate substrate with a rocking curve half width of 0.6 degrees. Using large grain-sized bi-layer graphene, 4 mm x 5 mm oxide layers were successfully exfoliated and transferred onto SiOx-Si. These insights pave the way for the heterogeneous integration of functional oxides on foreign substrates, holding significant implications for commercializing perovskite oxides by integrating them with Si-CMOS and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust surface states are a defining feature of topological photonic and acoustic systems. Although the supercell technique is commonly used for studying their surface effects, it falls short in sorting the states at two boundaries, differentiating surface states from bulk states, and demanding large computational resources. To overcome the limitations, we employ surface Green's functions combined with two efficient algorithms to obtain the ideal surface states for a semi-infinite system. They are further extended to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. Photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are taken as examples for demonstration and verification. The surface spectra obtained from our approach can be directly used for comparison with experimental observables. Our approach enriches the efficient computational tools for topological photonics and acoustics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-edge correspondence is a condensed matter theorem that relates the conductance of a Hall insulator in a half-plane to that of its (straight) boundary. In this work, we extend this result to domains with curved boundaries.
  Under mild geometric assumptions, we prove that the edge conductance of a topological insulator sample is an integer multiple of its Hall conductance. This integer counts the algebraic number of times that the interface (suitably oriented) enters the measurement set. This result provides a rigorous proof of a well-known experimental observation: arbitrarily truncated topological insulators support edge currents, regardless of the shape of their boundary.</description>

      <title>Doublons Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the large on-site interactions region, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form into doublon bound state and undergoes doublon BOs in the present of tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive a doublons effective Hamiltonian, and show that a minor change of $V$ can alter the dynamic behaviors of doublons qualitatively. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons act like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point with different initial states. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in the one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Probing hydrodynamic crossovers with dissipation-assisted operator evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.</description>

Remarkably, these quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibit a quantized integer Hall conductance that is different than expected from the filling and Chern number of the band.

      <title>Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Criticality in an Atomically Thin Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic critical fluctuations in magnetic materials encode important information about magnetic ordering in the associated critical exponents. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we implement $T_2$ (spin-decoherence) noise magnetometry to study critical dynamics in a 2D Van der Waals magnet CrSBr. By analyzing NV decoherence on time scales approaching the characteristic correlation time $\tau_c$ of critical fluctuations, we extract the critical exponent $\nu$ for the correlation length. Our result deviates from the Ising prediction and highlights the role of long-range dipolar interactions in 2D CrSBr. Furthermore, analyzing the divergence of the correlation length suggests the possibility of 2D-XY criticality in CrSBr in a temperature window near $T_C$ where static magnetic domains are absent. Our work provides a first demonstration of $T_2$ noise magnetometry to quantitatively analyze critical scaling behavior in 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate non-classical correlations between phonons and photons created using opto-mechanical spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a system based on a soft-clamped ultracoherent membrane oscillator inside of a Fabry-P\'erot optical resonator. Non-Gaussian quantum features are demonstrated for the center-of-mass motion of a sub-millimeter nanogram-scale mechanical oscillator. We show that phonons stored in the mechanical oscillator, when subsequently read out, display strong signs of quantum coherence, which we demonstrate by single-photon counting enabled by our state-of-the-art optical filtering system. We observe a violation of the classical two-time Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between a heralding write photon and a stored phonon with a confidence of $&gt;92\%$.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency : bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white" broadband photons. Our setup allows for the analysis of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the sampled time-dependent voltage. Using an ac+dc biased tunnel junction as a source of quantum microwave, we report an ultra-wide squeezing spectrum representing a competitive source for entanglement generation (up to 0.9 billion measured entangled bits per second) easily achievable experimentally. We also report the observation of quantum steering by the tunnel junction, and show how the presence of squeezing of a broadband mode implies the existence of entanglement between two modes it encompasses.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>
