      <title>Multi-photon stimulated grasers assisted by laser-plasma interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the possibility of achieving the stimulated amplification of $\gamma$-rays. Herein, our approach circumvents the so-called ``graser dilemma" through a non-linear, multi-photon mechanism. Our work foresees the combination of a high-intensity $\gamma-$flash generated by the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulse with plasma and intensive photons supplied by an additional laser. We show that multi-photon stimulated emission processes can have a larger effective cross-section compared to a one-photon process. The bandwidth of the supplied photons can also be tuned to curtail linewidth broadening. Naturally, Mossbauer transitions can be chosen to apply the scheme in the first instance. Furthermore, we derive that even multi-photon stimulated emission in the form of an anti-Stokes type could allow our scheme to be applied to non-Mossbauer nuclei, provided that the supplied photon energy can be tuned to compensate for the recoil and other broadening induced losses. The graser development can be spearheaded using multi-PW class high-power laser systems such as the 10 PW installation at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) in Romania.</description>

      <title>Modeling scattering matrix containing evanescent modes for wavefront shaping applications in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an open-source scalar wave transport model to estimate the generalized scattering matrix (S matrix) of a disordered medium in the diffusion regime. Here, the term generalization refers to the incorporation of evanescent wave field modes in addition to propagating modes while estimating the S matrix. For that we used the scalar Kirchhoff-Helmholtz boundary integral formulation together with the Green's function perturbation method to generalize the conventional Fisher-Lee relations to include evanescent modes as well. The estimated S matrix, which satisfies generalized unitarity and reciprocity conditions, is modeled for a 2D disordered waveguide. The generalized transmission matrix contained in the S matrix is used to estimate the optimal phase-conjugate wavefront for focusing onto an evanescent mode. The phenomena of universal transmission value of 2/3 for such an optimal phase conjugate wavefront is also shown in the context of evanescent wave mode focusing through a diffusive disorder. The presented code framework may be of interest to wavefront shaping researchers for visualizing and estimating wave transport properties in general.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of an optical tweezer phonon laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser-like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self-sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Errors in single pixel photography emerging from light collection limits by the bucket detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single pixel photography an image is sampled with a programmable optical element like a digital micromirror array or a spatial light modulator that can project an orthogonal base. The light reflected or diffracted is collected by a lens and measured with a photodiode (bucket detector). In this work we demonstrate that single pixel photography that uses sampling bases with non-zero off-diagonal elements (i.e. Hadamard), can be susceptible to errors that emerge from the relative size of the bucket detector area compared with the spatial spread of the Fourier spectrum of the base element that has the the highest spatial frequency. Experiments with a spatial light modulator and simulations using a Hadamard basis show that if the bucket detector area is smaller than between $50-75\%$ of the maximum area spanned by the projected spectrum of the measurement basis, the reconstructed photograph will exhibit cross-talk with the effective phase of the optical system. The phase can be encoded or errors can be introduced in the optical system to demonstrate this effect.</description>

      <title>Realization of Planar Optical Tweezer (2D-LOT) Powered by Light Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the realization of the first planar optical tweezer trap system by a sheet of light. To visualize the trapping of the target object (dielectric bead or live cell) in a plane, an orthogonal widefield detection is employed. The planar / two-dimensional lightsheet optical tweezer (2D-LOT) sub-system is realized in an inverted microscopy mode with illumination from the bottom. A 1064 nm laser (power $\sim 500 mW$) is expanded and directed to a combination of cylindrical lens and high NA objective lens to generate a tightly-focused diffraction-limited light sheet. The object to be trapped is injected in the specimen chamber (consists of two coverslips placed at a distance of $\approx 1~mm$) using a syringe. The illumination of trap-laser light is along Z-direction (with coverslip along XZ-plane) whereas, the detection is achieved perpendicular to the coverslip (along Y-axis). The orthogonal detection is employed to directly visualize the trapping in a plane. The characterization of system PSF estimates the size of light sheet trap PSF to be, $2073.84 ~\mu m^2$ which defines the active trap region / area. Beads are tracked on their way to the trap region for determining the trap stiffness along Z and X i.e, $k_z = 1.13 \pm 0.034 ~pN/\mu m$ and $k_x = 0.74 \pm 0.021 ~pN/ \mu m$. Results (image and video) show real-time trapping of dielectric beads in the trap zone (2D plane) generated by the light sheet. The beads can be seen getting trapped from all directions in the XZ-plane. Prolonged exposure to the light sheet builds up a 2D array of beads in the trap zone. Similar experiments on live NIH3T3 cells show cells trapped in the 2D trap. The potential of the planar trap lies in its ability to confine objects in two dimensions, thereby opening new kinds of experiments in biophysics, atomic physics, and optical physics.</description>

      <title>Efficient diffraction control using a tunable active-Raman gain medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new scheme to create all-optical tunable and lossless waveguide using a controllable coherent Raman process in an atomic rubidium vapor in N-type configuration. We employ a Gaussian Raman field and a Laguerre-Gaussian control field to imprint a high-contrast tunable waveguide-like feature inside the atomic medium. We numerically demonstrate that such a waveguide is able to guide arbitrary modes of a weak probe beam to several Rayleigh length without diffraction and absorption. Our results on all-optical waveguide based scheme may have potential application in lossless image processing, high contrast biomedical imaging and image metrology.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Beam assisted High-Order Harmonic Generation in Semiconductor Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the context of high harmonic generation (HHG) within semiconductor crystals. Our contribution deals with the transfer and conservation of OAM in the strong-field regime, from the driving laser field to the generated harmonics. To this end, in this work, we combine the semiconductor Bloch equations with the thin slab model to simulate the generation of high-order harmonics in semiconductor media and to compute the features of the far-field harmonics. We demonstrate that this theoretical approach is capable of satisfactorily reproduce previously published experimental features of the generated harmonics in ZnO driven by a Laguerre-Gauss beam. Our research not only deepens the understanding of light-solid interactions but also heralds the dawn of bright, structured XUV coherent radiation sources with unparalleled potential across diverse technological areas, paving the way for enhanced functionalities in fields such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and optical communication.</description>

      <title>A broadband vortex beam generation by reflective meta-surface based on metal double-slit resonant ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, meta-surface(MS) has emerged as a promising alternative method for generating vortex waves. At the same time, MS also face the problem of narrow bandwidth, in order to obtain a board bandwidth, the MS unit cells structure become more and more complex, which will deduce many inconveniences to the preparation process of MS device. Therefore, we want to design a simple MS unit cell with a multi-frequency selection. In this paper, based on the principle of geometric phase, we design a simple reflective MS unit cell based on metal double-slit resonant ring. We elaborate on the resonance mechanism of the MS unit cell. Under the normal incidence of circularly polarized (CP) waves, the reflection coefficient of the same polarization was greater than 85%. By rotating the orientation angle of the resonator on the MS unit cell, the continuous 2pi phase coverage was satisfied in the frequency range of 0.52THz-1.1THz, and the relative bandwidth becomes 71.6%. Based on this, we construct a vortex generator by using a 15*15 MS unit array. The right-handed circularly polarized waves (RCP) and left-handed circularly polarized waves (LCP) are separately incident on MS with topological charges of l=1,2,3 under multiple resonant frequencies. The generated RCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=-1,-2,-3 and the generated LCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=1,2,3. The numerical simulation results exhibit our designed MS with multiple resonance outcomes can achieve a multi-broadband operation and generate a wide-band vortex beam. In addition, we also calculate the pattern purity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we prove that our designed MS can generate a broadband vortex wave.</description>

      <title>Reversible optical isolators and quasi-circulators using a magneto-optical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optical devices are essential for laser protection, modern optical communication and quantum information processing by enforcing one-way light propagation. The conventional Faraday magneto-optical nonreciprocal devices rely on a strong magnetic field, which is provided by a permanent magnet. As a result, the isolation direction of such devices is fixed and severely restricts their applications in quantum networks.In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous one-way transmission and unidirectional reflection by using a magneto-optical Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and a magnetic field strength of $50~\milli\tesla$. An optical isolator and a three-port quasi-circulator are realized based on this nonreciprocal cavity system. The isolator achieves an isolation ratio of up to $22~\deci\bel$ and an averaged insertion loss down to $0.97~\deci\bel$. The quasi-circulator is realized with a fidelity exceeding $99\%$ and an overall survival probability of $89.9\%$, corresponding to an insertion loss of $\sim 0.46~\deci\bel$. The magnetic field is provided by an electromagnetic coil, thereby allowing for reversing the light circulating path. The reversible quasi-circulator paves the way for building reconfigurable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Breaking of Time Translation Symmetry and Ergodicity, and Entropy decrease in a Continuous Time Crystal Driven by Nonreciprocal Optical Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal nonequilibrium process are attracting growing interest in sociology, animal behaviour, chemistry, and nanotechnology, and may have played a role in the origin of life. It is less widely recognized, however, that in open systems light can induce nonreciprocal predator-prey like forces between nanoparticles. Such forces provide access to the continuous time crystal state of matter, which has been demonstrated in a plasmonic metamaterial array of nanowires wherein light triggers a spontaneous mobilization transition to the robust oscillatory state, breaking time translation symmetry. Here, we report on the first experimental study of the transient dynamics of light-induced mobilization and demobilization in a time crystal. By analysing time resolved phase trajectories of the system of nanowires, we show that the mobilization transition is accompanied by breaking of continuous time translation symmetry and ergodicity, and a decrease in the entropy of motion. This insight into the transient dynamics of a nonreciprocity-driven time crystal is relevant to optical timetronics, an information and communications technology paradigm relying on the unique functionalities of time crystals, and applications of the interacting nanowire oscillator platform to modelling a wide range of nonreciprocal processes from many-body dynamics to the early stages of matter-to-life transitions.</description>

      <title>Photonic Neuromorphic Accelerators for Event-Based Imaging Flow Cytometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present experimental results of a high-speed label-free imaging cytometry system that seamlessly merges the high-capturing rate and data sparsity of an event-based CMOS camera with lightweight photonic neuromorphic processing. This combination offers high classification accuracy and a massive reduction in the number of trainable parameters of the digital machine-learning back-end. The photonic neuromorphic accelerator is based on a hardware-friendly passive optical spectrum slicing technique that is able to extract meaningful features from the generated spike-trains. The experimental scenario comprises the discrimination of artificial polymethyl methacrylate calibrated beads, having different diameters, flowing at a mean speed of 0.01m/sec. Classification accuracy, using only lightweight, digital machine-learning schemes has topped at 98.2%. On the other hand, by experimentally pre-processing the raw spike data through the proposed photonic neuromorphic spectrum slicer we achieved an accuracy of 98.6%. This performance was accompanied by a reduction in the number of trainable parameters at the classification back-end by a factor ranging from 8 to 22, depending on the configuration of the digital neural network.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties within DPOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse\textcolor{red}{.} The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of high average, high peak power lasers has revived the effort of using lasers as a potential tool to influence natural lightning. Although impressive, the current progress in laser lightning control technology may only be the beginning of a phase involving a positive feedback between powerful laser development and atmospheric research. In this review paper, we critically evaluate the past, present and future of the Laser Lightning Rod Technology (LLRT) approach, considering both technological and scientific significance in atmospheric research.</description>

      <title>On the bubble-bubbleless ocean continuum and its meaning for the lidar equation: Lidar measurement of underwater bubble properties during storm conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the NRL shipboard lidar and the first lidar dataset of underwater bubbles. The meaning of these lidar observations, the algorithms used and their current limitations are discussed. The derivation of the lidar multiple scattering regime is derived from the lidar observations and theory. The detection of the underwater bubble presence and their depth is straightforward to estimate from the depolarized laser return. This dataset strongly suggest that the whitecaps term in the lidar equation formalism needs to be revisited. Void fraction retrieval is possible and the algorithm is stable with a simple ocean backscatter lidar system. The accuracy of the void fraction retrieval will increase significantly with future developments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solitary wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by the effects of third-, and fourth-order dispersion, maintaining a wavenumber gap between the solitary waves and the propagation constant. We numerically construct members of a family of such solitary waves, including Kruglov and Harvey's exact solution, using the spectral renormalization method and establish empirical relations between the pulse parameters. A deeper insight into the properties of solitary waves and solitons can be obtained through collisions. Therefore we perform pulse propagation simulations demonstrating different collision regimes. Depending on the pulses initial phase difference, this can lead to the formation of short-lived two-pulse bound states. While these collisions are generally inelastic, singular phase values exist at which they are elastic. Finally, we detail the properties of Kruglov and Harvey's soliton solution under loss, verifying earlier predictions of perturbation theory and suggesting a convergence to the soliton solution of the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the limit of large propagation distances.</description>

      <title>Thermal Crosstalk Modelling and Compensation Methods for Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits play an important role in the field of optical computing, promising faster and more energy-efficient operations compared to their digital counterparts. This advantage stems from the inherent suitability of optical signals to carry out matrix multiplication. However, even deterministic phenomena such as thermal crosstalk make precise programming of photonic chips a challenging task. Here, we train and experimentally evaluate three models incorporating varying degrees of physics intuition to predict the effect of thermal crosstalk in different locations of an integrated programmable photonic mesh. We quantify the effect of thermal crosstalk by the resonance wavelength shift in the power spectrum of a microring resonator implemented in the chip, achieving modelling errors &lt;0.5 pm. We experimentally validate the models through compensation of the crosstalk-induced wavelength shift. Finally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of one of the models by employing it to predict and compensate for the effect of thermal crosstalk for parts of the chip it was not trained on, revealing root-mean-square-errors of &lt;2.0 pm.</description>

      <title>Observation of strong backscattering in valley-Hall photonic topological interface modes</title>

Abstract: The unique properties of light underpin the visions of photonic quantum technologies, optical interconnects, and a wide range of novel sensors, but a key limiting factor today is losses due to either absorption or backscattering on defects. Recent developments in topological photonics have fostered the vision of backscattering-protected waveguides made from topological interface modes, but, surprisingly, measurements of their propagation losses were so far missing. Here we report on measurements of losses in the slow-light regime of valley-Hall topological waveguides and find no indications of topological protection against backscattering on ubiquitous structural defects. We image the light scattered out from the topological waveguides and find that the propagation losses are due to Anderson localization. The only photonic topological waveguides proposed for materials without intrinsic absorption in the optical domain are quantum spin-Hall and valley-Hall interface states, but the former exhibits strong out-of-plane losses, and our work therefore raises fundamental questions about the real-world value of topological protection in reciprocal photonics.</description>

Abstract: Topological design enables robustness to be engineered into a system. However, a general challenge remains to experimentally characterize topological properties. In this work, we demonstrate a technique for directly observing a winding-number invariant using a single measurement. By propagating light with a sufficiently broad spectrum along a topological photonic crystal fiber, we calculate the winding number invariant from the output intensity pattern. We quantify the capabilities of this single-shot method, which works even for surprisingly narrow and asymmetric spectral distributions. We demonstrate our approach using topological fiber, but our method is generalizable to other platforms. Our method is experimentally straightforward: we use only a broadband input excitation and a single output to measure the topological invariant.</description>

      <title>Low-power, agile electro-optic frequency comb spectrometer for integrated sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing platforms based upon photonic integrated circuits have shown considerable promise; however, they require corresponding advancements in integrated optical readout technologies. Here, we present an on-chip spectrometer that leverages an integrated thin-film lithium niobate modulator to produce a frequency-agile electro-optic frequency comb for interrogating chip-scale temperature and acceleration sensors. The chirped comb process allows for ultralow radiofrequency drive voltages, which are as much as seven orders of magnitude less than the lowest found in the literature and are generated using a chip-scale, microcontroller-driven direct digital synthesizer. The on-chip comb spectrometer is able to simultaneously interrogate both an on-chip temperature sensor and an off-chip, microfabricated optomechanical accelerometer with cutting-edge sensitivities of $\approx 5\ {\mu} \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ and $\approx 130\ \mu \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$, respectively. This platform is compatible with a broad range of existing photonic integrated circuit technologies, where its combination of frequency agility and ultralow radiofrequency power requirements are expected to have applications in fields such as quantum science and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Consideration of non-phase-matched nonlinear effects in the design of quasi-phase-matching crystals for optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are widely used in ultrafast nonlinear frequency conversion and quantum information. However, conventional OPOs based on quasi-phase-matching (QPM) crystals have many parasitic non-phase-matched processes which decreases the conversion efficiency. Here, we propose nine-wave coupled equations (NWCEs) to simulate all phase-matched and non-phase-matched interactions in QPM crystals to improve conventional three-wave coupled equations (TWCEs), especially for the situation of high intensity ultrashort pulses and complexly structured crystals. We discuss how to design the poling period of QPM crystal to maximize the conversion efficiency of signal light for a given OPO system. The simulation reveals that the OPO based on chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPPLN) with certain chirp rate has higher signal wave conversion efficiency than that of a PPLN, and demonstrates that NWCEs illustrates more details of the pulse evolution in the OPO cavity. Starting from a CPPLN, an aperiodically poled lithium niobate (APPLN) design is available by modifying the domain lengths of the crystal and optimizing the OPO output power via dynamical optimization algorithm. The results show that by using a properly designed APPLN crystal, a 1600nm OPO, when pumped by a femtosecond laser with 1030nm central wavelength, 150 femtosecond pulse duration and 5 GW/cm2 power intensity at the focus, can achieve very efficient output with a signal light conversion efficiency of 50.6%, which is higher than that of PPLN (25.2%) and CPPLN (40.2%). The scheme in this paper will provide a reference for the design of nonlinear QPM crystals of OPOs and will help to understand the complex nonlinear dynamical behavior in OPO cavities.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Frequency Up-Converted Infrared Signals with a Molecular Optomechanical Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency up-conversion, enabled by molecular optomechanical coupling, has recently emerged as a promising approach for converting infrared signals into the visible range through quantum coherent conversion of signals. However, detecting these converted signals poses a significant challenge due to their inherently weak signal intensity. In this work, we propose an amplification mechanism capable of enhancing the signal intensity by a factor of 1000 or more for the frequency up-converted infrared signal in a molecular optomechanical system. The mechanism takes advantage of the strong coupling enhancement with molecular collective mode and Stokes sideband pump. This work demonstrates a feasible approach for up-converting infrared signals to the visible range.</description>

      <title>Limitations in design and applications of ultra-small mode volume photonic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-small mode volume nanophotonic crystal cavities have been proposed as powerful tools for increasing coupling rates in cavity quantum electrodynamics systems. However, their adoption in quantum information applications remains elusive. In this work, we investigate possible reasons why, and analyze the impact of different low mode volume resonator design choices on their utility in quantum optics experiments. We analyze band structure features and loss rates of low mode volume bowtie cavities in diamond and demonstrate independent design control over cavity-emitter coupling strength and loss rates. Further, using silicon vacancy centers in diamond as exemplary emitters, we investigate the influence of placement imprecision. We find that the benefit on photon collection efficiency and indistinguishability is limited, while the fabrication complexity of ultra-small cavity designs increases substantially compared to conventional photonic crystals. We conclude that ultra-small mode volume designs are primarily of interest for dispersive spin-photon interactions, which are of great interest for future quantum networks.</description>
