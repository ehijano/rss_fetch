      <title>Casimir-Polder energy landscape: Unipolarizable atom and ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir-Polder interaction energy between a unipolarizable point atom and a unipolarizable dielectric ring has been limited, until now, to the case when the atom is confined on the axis of symmetry of the ring. We find the generalized analytical expression for any position of the atom relative to the ring in terms of complete elliptic integrals. This is aided by the construction of a class of integrals of a Jacobian elliptic function as a linear combination of complete elliptic integrals. Our expression for the interaction energy allows us to investigate the instability of the atom even for the equilibrium points which exists off the axis of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spin textures: Emergent electrodynamics, quantum geometry, and probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent electrodynamics arising from spatially and temporally varying magnetic textures provides a framework for spin control in quantum materials. While this principle is established for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic textures, its consequences for altermagnets -- magnetic orders with vanishing net magnetization but finite spin splitting -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an effective low-energy theory of itinerant electrons coupled to smoothly varying altermagnetic spin textures. In the adiabatic regime, we show that altermagnetic textures generate additional emergent electromagnetic fields and quantum-geometric effects that are absent in conventional magnetic systems. These effects include emergent Zeeman fields that encode the structure of the altermagnetic order parameter, enabling local spin manipulation and a way to distinguish different altermagnetic orders. Moreover, we demonstrate a quantum-metric-induced, spin-dependent electron lensing effect that provides a mechanism for spin filtering, and discuss the local admixture of effective odd-parity magnetic components. Our results suggest that textured altermagnets could serve as a versatile resource for spintronics functionalities and a probe of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Electromotive entrainment of charge and heat currents in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic theory of charge and heat currents induced by traveling waves, such as surface acoustic waves, in graphene devices near charge neutrality. The currents depend on the intrinsic conductivity and viscosity of the electron liquid, the disorder strength, and the geometry of the device. We obtain analytic expressions for the heat and charge currents to second order in the wave amplitude for Hall-bar devices. At charge neutrality and in the absence of DC bias, the heat content is entrained by the wave in the absence of net charge transfer. At the same time, device conductance is enhanced by the wave. Away from charge neutrality, the transport charge current induced by the wave arises in the absence of a DC bias.</description>

      <title>Electronic dynamics in long linear and cyclic polyynes towards the carbyne limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbyne-the one-dimensional sp-hybridised allotrope of carbon-has long been predicted to exhibit unique properties, yet its synthesis remains elusive. To probe its behaviour, finite sp-carbon chains such as cumulenes and polyynes have been studied, but work to date has focused almost exclusively on short, linear systems far from the infinite carbyne limit and without considering topology. Here, we investigate long (48-carbon) linear and cyclic polyynes using steady-state and ultrafast, temperature- and polarization-resolved optical and vibrational spectroscopy. We find highly delocalized ground states in both topologies, with Peierls distortions markedly weaker than in short chains. In contrast, excited states undergo rapid self-localisation, with the localisation pathway and subsequent intersystem crossing strongly dependent on chain length and topology. Unlike shorter polyynes, excited-state structural rearrangements are minimal, and comparison with theoretical predictions shows that properties, such as Huang-Rhys factors, have plateaued by 48 carbons. Our results reveal how topology influences the electronic dynamics of long polyynes and refines our understanding of sp-carbon systems approaching the carbyne limit</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic effect in few layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the nonlinear photogalvanic effect in few-layer graphene with various stacking orders, including AA- and AB-stacked bilayers, and AAA-, ABA-, and ABC-stacked trilayers. Using a tight-binding model to describe the electronic states, the shift current conductivity and jerk current conductivity are calculated over a broad spectral range from terahertz to visible frequencies. Our symmetry analysis reveals that a nonvanishing shift current emerges only in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene due to its broken inversion symmetry, with a peak conductivity reaching approximately $1.21 \times 10^{-13}$ A$\cdot$m/V$^2$ at optimal doping. In contrast, the jerk current, permitted in all structures, requires an in-plane static electric field and exhibits pronounced spectral tunability with chemical potential. These findings establish a comprehensive symmetry-band-field coupling paradigm for nonlinear photocurrents in layered graphene and provide design principles for tunable, polarization-sensitive photodetection and energy-harvesting devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic conversion in integrated YIG nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent proposal of two-step transduction from microwave to optical domain using magnetic and elastic intermediate stages arXiv:2205.05088, we consider the coupling between resonant magnetic and elastic modes within a simple axially-symmetric nanodevice designed to host high-quality-factor acoustic modes: A suspended YIG ring structure supported by a central stem, fabricated from a continuous single-crystal film. We study the modes of the system with our custom finite element solvers. We identify the lowest order ``breathing'' mode of a magnetic vortex and the lowest order elastic breathing mode as having the largest mode overlap. For this pair of modes, the external out-of-plane magnetic bias field is critical for bringing them into resonance; however, we show that at the same time it also affects the strength of the coupling. To counteract this, we optimize the radius of the ring at fixed thickness. For the 100 nm-thick film the resonant coupling is maximized at $g/2\pi = 8\text{MHz}$ at $R\approx1.7\mu\text{m}$, indicating that the overlap integral approaches the idealized limit assumed in previous order-of-magnitude estimates. Our results pave the way for the design of tunable frequency-conversion devices based on magnetoelastics.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional magnetic imaging of magnetic anisotropy and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micron scale imaging of magnetic fields is an important tool for understanding the evolution of magnetism through phase transitions and as a result of interactions inside of heterostructures. However, most imaging platforms, like the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, are restricted to applying magnetic fields along the quantisation axis of the quantum sensor. This greatly restricts the utility of these systems for exploring materials that emit strong fields or exhibit variable response with respect to the applied field direction. Here we explore an alternative approach using weakly coupled spin-pairs in hBN that exhibit a spin-1/2-like behaviour and an isotropic response to magnetic field. We demonstrate that the spin-pair system can operate in the presence of strong fields from a thin film magnet which were incompatible with NV diamond imaging even with applied fields along the quantisation axis. Further, we demonstrate that using this platform allows for imaging with an arbitrary applied magnetic field direction, allowing us to probe the anisotropy and spin-reorientation transition in the ferrimagnet TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$. Finally, we propose an improved geometry for imaging small anisotropy contributions such as crystalline anisotropy. These results demonstrate how this or similar spin-1/2 systems might be used for imaging magnetic materials that are incompatible with other techniques despite the reduction in sensitivity compared with NV in diamond imaging.</description>

      <title>Complex dispersion lines in gapped bilayer graphene: Analytical expressions and shear-displacement effects on monolayer--bilayer--monolayer junction conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical treatments of tunneling in bilayer graphene have typically relied on minimal models including only the vertical interlayer hopping $\gamma_1$ and have been restricted to the weak interlayer bias regime $2\varepsilon \ll \gamma_1$. These simplifications limit the ability of analytical theories to describe lattice deformations and strong electric-field effects. In this work, we present an analytical theory of evanescent states in electrically gapped bilayer graphene that overcomes both limitations. Specifically, our approach explicitly incorporates the skew interlayer hoppings $\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_4$ and remains valid even when the interlayer bias $2\varepsilon$ is comparable to $\gamma_1$. Focusing on low-energy electronic states near the charge neutrality point, we analytically derive the complex longitudinal wave numbers, the gap width, and the sublattice pseudospin inside the electric-field-induced gap, and systematically analyze their dependence on the interlayer shear displacement $\vec{\delta}=(\delta_x,\delta_y)$. The analytical expressions quantitatively reproduce exact numerical calculations, demonstrating that skew interlayer hoppings, in particular $\gamma_3$, play an essential role. Taking the zigzag direction as the longitudinal (transport) $x$ direction, the wave vector becomes complex along $x$ while remaining real along the transverse $y$ direction. For a monolayer--bilayer--monolayer junction with transport along this direction, we find that $\delta_y$ has a significantly stronger impact on the conductance than $\delta_x$. This anisotropic response is quantitatively explained by the analytical expressions. Furthermore, we identify a shear-induced phase proportional to $\delta_y$ that appears universally in the analytical expressions for the gap width, the sublattice pseudospin, and the decay length.</description>

      <title>Disorder-independent hole spin manipulation by hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin manipulation by hopping has recently emerged as a promising strategy to control hole spins in quantum dots using exclusively baseband control, thereby mitigating power dissipation and high-frequency management constraints in large-scale architectures. Unlike conventional approaches such as electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR), this mechanism exploits dot-to-dot variations of the spin precession axes to enable spin rotations. However, it is intrinsically disorder-dependent: in the absence of sufficient variability, the precession axes remain aligned and spin manipulation becomes ineffective. This fundamental reliance on disorder raises concerns regarding its compatibility with the long-term evolution of spin-qubit platforms toward improved material quality, cleaner interfaces, and enhanced device reproducibility. Here, we numerically assess the viability of spin manipulation by hopping as a function of disorder strength and demonstrate that its implementation is indeed increasingly constrained as disorder is reduced. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative strategy based on hopping between intentionally squeezed quantum dots. This approach retains the advantages of baseband control while being independent of disorder and robust against moderate variability, thereby offering improved prospects for scalable hole-spin quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Topological Dislocation Response in Elementary Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20754v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study elementary semiconductors and insulators that are symmetric under spatial inversion: silicon, diamond, germanium, and black phosphorene. These materials are ideal candidates for realizing obstructed atomic insulators, which differ from trivial atomic insulators by a quantized spatial shift of their electronic Wannier centers with respect to the atomic lattice. We use symmetry indicator invariants that allow the prediction of non-trivial responses to crystal dislocations in these materials. We find that edge dislocations generically exhibit a non-trivial response, while screw dislocations always display a trivial response. With the aid of numerical simulations of realistic tight-binding models, we confirm the presence of mid-gap polarization bands localized along dislocations in silicon, diamond, and germanium.</description>

      <title>Efficient two-color Floquet control of the RKKY interaction in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Flux-Driven Conductance Scaling in Disordered Topological Insulator Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum transport in disordered topological insulator nanowires (TINWs) under axial magnetic flux. At integer flux quanta, spin-momentum locking produces weak anti-localization peaks, while at half-integer flux quanta a helical mode protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) suppresses backscattering. By analyzing the flux dependence of the localization length, we uncover critical scaling around half-integer flux quanta, reflecting the competition between disorder scattering and flux-induced breaking of TRS protection. As the disorder strength increases, we identify a crossover in scaling behavior that drives the system into a regime governed by a universal critical exponent. Our results demonstrate a scaling collapse across flux values, establishing a universal regime of flux-driven delocalization in TINWs.</description>

      <title>Zandpack: A General Tool for Time-dependent Transport Simulation of Nanoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auxiliary mode approach to time-dependent open quantum system calculations is implemented and refined to yield a feasible computational approach to simulate nanostructures far from equilibrium. It is done by a careful diagonalization of the electrode level-width function, and provides an efficient approach which can simulate large, open systems at the level of time-dependent density functional theory. The approach, as given in this work, is implemented in the new open-source code Zandpack. The framework is applied to three systems perturbed by the same THz electromagnetic field pulse-form: 1) A Hubbard model for hydrogen on graphene is used to calculate spin-currents, mutual information, spin-transitions, and a pump-probe setup. 2) An armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) probed by a metal tip showing electrons excited from the valence band of the AGNR into the tip via electron-electron interactions. 3) A gold break-junction is modeled with various gap distances, and displays behavior that is more different from the adiabatic case as the gap widens. In the examples 2 and 3, we develop and use a general linearization scheme for time-dependent open system calculations, which utilizes the DFTB+ or SIESTA codes.</description>

      <title>Observation of sequential quantum oscillations induced by mini-Landau bands in a three-dimensional Dirac semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations, the oscillatory behavior of electrical and thermodynamic properties, are typically observed in metals and vanish in the quantum limit under strong magnetic fields1. Phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect2, the Hofstadter butterfly3,4, and recent observations of quantum oscillations in exotic insulators are notable exceptions5-12. The narrow-gap Dirac semiconductor ZrTe5, a less exotic material without strong correlations or artificially engineered superlattices, nevertheless exhibits resistance oscillations in the quantum limit13 but can be interpreted within a simple Zeeman-effect-based picture14,15, which remains conventional quantum oscillations without exotic properties. Here, we report the observation of unexpected mini-oscillations superimposed on Zeeman-effect-induced main oscillations in the quantum limit. The subtracted mini-oscillations are periodic in 1/B with the highest frequency equal to 2.1% of the first Brillouin zone and have extremely heavy effective mass ~ 2me, which is unexpected in ZrTe5 given its ultralow carrier density. Additionally, the mini-oscillations exhibit sequential features that are synchronized with the main oscillations, suggesting an internal structure of the Landau bands. However, they appear incompatible with the Hofstadter butterfly due to the highly anisotropic/three-dimensional crystal structure. These sequential mini-oscillations correlate with the commensurability resonance effect with subunity fractions observed in angular magnetoresistance, relating to the formation of mini-Landau bands. Our results present solid experimental evidence of exotic quantum oscillations in the quantum limit beyond currently available mechanisms, and establish ZrTe5, a prototypical Dirac semiconductor, as a simple platform parallel to correlated insulators for exploring exotic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic small-angle neutron scattering by a nanocrystalline ferromagnet with anisotropic exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A micromagnetic framework for magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is presented that accounts for weak symmetric anisotropic exchange in centrosymmetric nanocrystalline ferromagnets. The exchange interaction is expressed via a general fourth-rank tensor decomposed into isotropic and deviatoric parts. We start with the exchange energy and effective field, assuming weakly fluctuating in space saturation magnetization, solve micromagnetic problem to find spatial distribution of local magnetization vector and compute the averaged (over random orientations of nanocrystals) SANS cross sections. The isotropic part reproduces the classical Heisenberg-type SANS response, while non-zero deviatoric part of the exchange tensor gives rise to new angular harmonics in the magnetic SANS cross section. As a specific example, analytical response functions for an exchange tensor with hexagonal symmetry in perpendicular and parallel scattering geometries are derived. The results provide a basis for identifying and quantifying symmetric exchange anisotropy in magnetic SANS experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions in chiral magnets are topological solitons, localized in three dimensions. But is their localization strong? To address this question we derive an asymptotic expansion for the isolated hopfion's spatial profile. It becomes starting point for a simple analytical model, which is asymptotically correct both near the hopfion center and far away from it. Region of equilibrium hopfions on the phase diagram of a helimagnet is computed and material requirements for supporting movable isolated magnetic hopfions on uniform background are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological Floquet Green's function zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum emulation using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and an increased interest in topological Green's function zeros in condensed matter systems, we here study Green's function zeros in topological Floquet systems. We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green's-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI. In the vicinity of special points in the free fermion phase diagram and using tailor-made interactions which lead to the Floquet version of symmetric mass generation, we analytically calculate both edge and bulk Green's functions. Just as in the case of continuum time evolution, topological bands of Green's function zeros may also contribute to the topological invariant. However, contrary to the case of continuum time evolution, Floquet Green's functions can have zeros even in the absence of interactions. Finally, we also discuss an implementation of this Floquet system in a digital quantum emulator: We present a circuit which encodes the interaction under consideration and pinpoint the observables carrying information about the topological Green's function boundary zeros.</description>

      <title>Qubit Noise Spectroscopy of Superconducting Dynamics in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An applied magnetic field affects a superconductor in two ways -- by promoting pairing fluctuations, and by inducing topological defects called vortices that carry quantized magnetic flux. A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids: From microscopic instabilities to universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic fragmentation of residually stressed solids involves a complex interplay between stored elastic energy, stress wave propagation, and crack instabilities. In this work, we investigate the fracture mechanics of chemically toughened glass through high-velocity projectile impact experiments and a novel micromechanical network model. We rigorously incorporate residual stress into the discrete lattice framework via a prescribed inelastic strain (eigenstrain) distribution, formulated as equivalent body and surface forces to ensure mesh-independent fracture paths. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that while the fracture topology shifts from coarse to fine with increasing impact energy, the cumulative fragment size distribution consistently follows an exponential decay. Crucially, we reveal a universal scaling law: fragment size distributions from diverse loading conditions and stress profiles collapse onto a single master curve when normalized by the mean fragment area. Furthermore, the model elucidates the determinants of fragmentation, showing that the resulting fragment size is governed not only by the magnitude of residual stress but also by the steepness of the stress gradient. At the microscopic scale, we identify a mechanism for dynamic instability where non-sequential bond breaking ahead of the crack tip leads to apparent local crack speeds exceeding the Rayleigh wave speed ($c_r$). These arrested micro-branches, analogous to the Burridge-Andrews mechanism, provide a physical explanation for the "tongue-like" features and hackle zones observed in post-mortem fractography.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown as an entanglement transition driven by continuous measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Kondo screening by a local magnetic field from the perspective of a measurement-driven entanglement transition in a monitored quantum system. Here, the Kondo coupling leads to the growth in entanglement of an impurity spin with it's fermionic environment, while the local field plays the role of a continuous observer. Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid. Various impurity signatures such as the spectral function and thermalisation of impurity observables are used to characterise this entanglement transition. These results offer insight into the interplay of decoherence and measurement in governing the dynamics of a prototypical quantum system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point-like Defects in Bulk Semiconductors: Junction Spectroscopy Techniques for Perovskite Solar Cells and 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Junction spectroscopy techniques (JSTs) are powerful tools for investigating electrically active defects in semiconductors. Originally developed to study point-like defects in bulk semiconductors, JSTs have since been extended to increasingly complex systems, providing valuable insights into defect energetics and interactions. This review paper outlines the fundamental principles of JSTs and critically examines their application to emerging materials, such as perovskite solar cells and two-dimensional (2D) materials. By highlighting both the capabilities and limitations of JSTs in these non-classical systems, the review demonstrates their continued relevance and important role in advancing next-generation semiconductor materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional spin valve effect in altermagnets induced by Rashba spin orbit coupling and triplet superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin dependent transport in altermagnet/triplet superconductor/altermagnet (AM/TSC/AM) junctions in the presence of interfacial Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC). Within a microscopic Bogoliubov de Gennes scattering formalism, we compute angle and energy resolved conductance, spin polarization, zero bias response, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for nodal $p_x$ and chiral $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors. Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry. For nodal $p_x$ superconductor, sign change induced surface Andreev bound states dominate subgap transport, producing strongly anisotropic conductance, giant zero bias spin polarization, and a monotonic enhancement of TMR with increasing RSOC. In contrast, the chiral $p_x+ip_y$ state exhibits smoother conductance and polarization profiles governed by topological edge modes, resulting in broader, lobe like TMR patterns with weaker sensitivity to interface transparency. Moreover, RSOC can acts as an electrically tunable spin-mixing knob, while the barrier strength controls coherence and energy selectivity, together enabling large, symmetry controlled spin filtering and magnetoresistance. Our results establish AM/TSC/AM junctions as a symmetry sensitive transport platform for realizing electrically tunable spin valve functionality and probing triplet pairing without ferromagnetic components.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum transport in non-Markovian open Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build an exact framework to evaluate heat, energy, and particle transport between Gaussian reservoirs mediated by a quadratic quantum system. By combining full counting statistics with newly developed non-Markovian master equation approaches, we introduce an effective master equation whose solution can be used to generate arbitrary moments of the heat statistics for any number of reservoirs. This theory applies equally to fermionic and bosonic systems, holds at arbitrarily strong coupling, and resolves out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics determined by the system's initial state. In the steady-state, weak-coupling limit, we recover results analogous to those of the well-known Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We conclude our discussion by demonstrating an application of the method to a prototypical fermionic system. Our results uncover a regime of transient negative heat conductance contingent upon the initial system preparation, providing a clear signature of non-trivial out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Axial vectors, such as current or magnetization, are commonly used order parameters in time-reversal symmetry breaking systems. These vectors also break isotropy in three dimensional systems, lowering the spatial symmetry. We demonstrate that it is possible to construct a three-dimensional medium with average isotropy and inversion symmetry where time-reversal symmetry is systematically broken. We devise a model of an amorphous material with scalar time-reversal symmetry breaking, implemented by hopping through chiral magnetic clusters along the bonds. The presence of only average spatial symmetries -- continuous rotation and inversion -- is sufficient to protect a topological phase, yielding a statistical topological insulator. We demonstrate the topological nature of our model by constructing a bulk integer topological invariant for the effective continuum model, which guarantees gapless surface spectrum on any surface with an odd number of Dirac nodes, analogous to crystalline mirror Chern insulators. We also show the expected transport properties of a three-dimensional statistical topological insulator, which remains critical on the surface for odd values of the invariant.</description>

Abstract: Collision of quantum particles remains an effective way of probing their mutual statistics. Colliders based on quantum point contacts in quantum Hall edge states have been successfully used to probe the statistics of the underlying quantum particles. Notwithstanding the extensive theoretical work focusing on point-like colliders, when it comes to experiment, the colliders are rarely point-like objects and can support a resonant level or multiple tunneling points. We present a study of a paradigmatic extended (non-point-like) fermionic collider (and an extension to bosonic colliders). As with particle interferometers, in an extended collider there is an infinite number of trajectories for any single or multi-particle event. Self-interference of the former can lead to an apparent bunching of fermions when we compare the cross-current correlator with a classical benchmark representing two colliding beams. In view of this apparent bunching behavior of fermions, we identify an experimentally accessible current correlator which reveals the true mutual statistics of fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport properties of nanofluidic channels are usually studied under constant (DC) voltage or pressure driving. However, the frequency response under sinusoidal (AC) drivings offers rich insights into the time-dependent transport mechanisms. Inspired by recent electrochemical approaches, we investigate the couplings between ionic and electronic transport under AC driving. We show that conduction electrons of the channel walls participate in ionic current via capacitive electrochemical coupling, defining a critical frequency and length scale where electron-dominated conductivity emerges. We further analyze how electron-ion coupling modifies electro-osmotic flows, and demonstrate that fluctuation-induced momentum transfer between the electrolyte and wall electrons produces distinct AC transport signatures depending on the charge carrier polarity. Altogether, we establish a frequency-dependent transport matrix that couples ionic, electronic and hydrodynamic flows. These findings establish AC nanofluidic transport as a powerful probe of interfacial phenomena under confinement, and suggest new directions for engineering nanofluidic functionalities through electron-electrolyte coupling.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles are promising platforms for quantum emission, as revealed by recent experimental observations. In this work, we present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ nanobubbles, linking their structural and electronic properties to predictions of their optical activity. Inflating forces yield tunable geometries with non-uniform, apex-concentrated strain, which is sensitive to material rigidity. Strain modifies band gaps and universally induces non-dispersive valence states, exhibiting composition-dependent wave-function character, as revealed by an in-depth analysis of band structures and orbital contributions. Crucially, transitions from these apex-localized valence states are predominantly dark. This characteristic is attributed to their localization at the $\Gamma$-point, inhibiting transitions to the lowest unoccupied states that reside at the K-valley. While revealing that the herein considered sub-10-nm nanobubbles fall short as single-photon emitters, our findings provide essential understanding of the structure-property relations in emerging quantum materials, providing robust design rules to optimize their characteristics for novel quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Chern band in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. We further show that this non-Abelian topology is characterized by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge flux threading the noncontractible cycles of the Brillouin zone, leading to a global non-Abelian holonomy. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in two-dimensional real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the transverse Hall-like voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Transition between one- and two-dimensional topology in a Chern insulator of finite width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.</description>

      <title>Minimal Time Robust for Two Superconducting Qubits</title>

Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F &gt; 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F &gt; 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F &gt; 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Field-Theoretic Framework via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of a Liouvillian Exceptional Spectral Phase in a Collective Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian degeneracies of Lindblad generators (Liouvillian exceptional points) can induce non-exponential relaxation and higher-order poles in dynamical response functions. A collective spin coupled to a polarized Markovian bath exhibits an \emph{exceptional spectral phase} in which defective Liouvillian modes imprint super-Lorentzian features in frequency-resolved spectra. We compute the emission spectrum via the Liouvillian resolvent, identify symmetry-sector selection rules, and demonstrate that exceptional-point signatures are strongly state-dependent: they are suppressed in steady-state fluorescence yet become unambiguous for generic (infinite-temperature or random) initial states. Our results provide an experimentally accessible spectroscopic diagnostic of many-body Liouvillian exceptional phases and clarify when steady-state emission can (and cannot) reveal them.</description>
