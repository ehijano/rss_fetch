      <title>GPS-IMU Sensor Fusion for Reliable Autonomous Vehicle Position Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation provides accurate positioning with global coverage, making it a reliable option in open areas with unobstructed sky views. However, signal degradation may occur in indoor spaces and urban canyons. In contrast, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) consist of gyroscopes and accelerometers that offer relative motion information such as acceleration and rotational changes. Unlike GPS, IMUs do not rely on external signals, making them useful in GPS-denied environments. Nonetheless, IMUs suffer from drift over time due to the accumulation of errors while integrating acceleration to determine velocity and position. Therefore, fusing the GPS and IMU is crucial for enhancing the reliability and precision of navigation systems in autonomous vehicles, especially in environments where GPS signals are compromised. To ensure smooth navigation and overcome the limitations of each sensor, the proposed method fuses GPS and IMU data. This sensor fusion uses the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) Bayesian filtering technique. The proposed navigation system is designed to be robust, delivering continuous and accurate positioning critical for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, particularly in GPS-denied environments. This project uses KITTI GNSS and IMU datasets for experimental validation, showing that the GNSS-IMU fusion technique reduces GNSS-only data's RMSE. The RMSE decreased from 13.214, 13.284, and 13.363 to 4.271, 5.275, and 0.224 for the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively. The experimental result using UKF shows promising direction in improving autonomous vehicle navigation using GPS and IMU sensor fusion using the best of two sensors in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>Slow Inter-area Electro-mechanical Oscillations Revisited: Structural Property of Complex Multi-area Electric Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a physically-intuitive notion of inter-area dynamics in systems comprising multiple interconnected energy conversion modules. The ideas build on an earlier general approach to setting their structural properties by modeling first stand-alone modular dynamics starting from the fundamental relations between energy stored in modules (components, areas), and constraining explicitly their Tellegen's quantities, power and rate of change of power, in particular. In this paper we derive, by following the same principles, a transformed state-space model for a general nonlinear system. Using this model we show the existence of an area-level interaction variable, intVar, whose rate of change depends solely on the area internal power imbalance. Given these structural properties of stand-alone modules, we define in this paper for the first time an inter-area variable as the difference of power wave incident to tie-line from Area I and the power reflected into tie-lie from Area II. Notably, these power waves represent the rate of change of intVars associated with the two interconnected areas. We illustrate these notions using a linearized case of two lossless inter-connected areas, and show the existence of a new inter-area mode when the areas get connected. We suggest that lessons learned in this paper open possibilities for computationally-efficient modeling and control of inter-area oscillations, and offer further the basis for modeling and control of dynamics in changing systems comprising faster energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>AI-driven, Model-Free Current Control: A Deep Symbolic Approach for Optimal Induction Machine Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposed a straightforward and efficient current control solution for induction machines employing deep symbolic regression (DSR). The proposed DSR-based control design offers a simple yet highly effective approach by creating an optimal control model through training and fitting, resulting in an analytical dynamic numerical expression that characterizes the data. Notably, this approach not only produces an understandable model but also demonstrates the capacity to extrapolate and estimate data points outside its training dataset, showcasing its adaptability and resilience. In contrast to conventional state-of-the-art proportional-integral (PI) current controllers, which heavily rely on specific system models, the proposed DSR-based approach stands out for its model independence. Simulation and experimental tests validate its effectiveness, highlighting its superior extrapolation capabilities compared to conventional methods. These findings pave the way for the integration of deep learning methods in power conversion applications, promising improved performance and adaptability in the control of induction machines. The simulation and experimental test results are provided with a 3.7 kw induction machine to verify the efficacy of the proposed control solution.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Unsupervised Anomaly detection framework in multivariate time-series of industrial dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new model-free anomaly detection framework is proposed for time-series induced by industrial dynamical systems. The framework lies in the category of conventional approaches which enable appealing features such as, a fast learning with reduced amount of learning data, a reduced memory, a high potential for explainability as well as easiness of incremental learning mechanism to incorporate operator feedback after an alarm is raised an analyzed. All these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solution by industry but they are rarely considered in the comparisons between competing methods which generally exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Data-driven memory-dependent abstractions of dynamical systems via a Cantor-Kantorovich metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstractions of dynamical systems enable their verification and the design of feedback controllers using simpler, usually discrete, models. In this paper, we propose a data-driven abstraction mechanism based on a novel metric between Markov models. Our approach is based purely on observing output labels of the underlying dynamics, thus opening the road for a fully data-driven approach to construct abstractions. Another feature of the proposed approach is the use of memory to better represent the dynamics in a given region of the state space. We show through numerical examples the usefulness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Robust Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Applied to Satellite Rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF. This framework offers a promising solution for robust estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems, opening new avenues for efficient and reliable estimation in various industries that can benefit from neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>The distributed biased min-consensus protocol revisited: pre-specified finite time control strategies and small-gain based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the classical distributed consensus protocols enabling the group of agents as a whole to reach an agreement regarding a certain quantity of interest in a distributed fashion, the distributed biased min-consensus protocol (DBMC) has been proven to generate advanced complexity pertaining to solving the shortest path problem. As such a protocol is commonly incorporated as the first step of a hierarchical architecture in real applications, e.g., robots path planning, management of dispersed computing services, an impedance limiting the application potential of DBMC lies in, the lack of results regarding to its convergence within a user-assigned time. In this paper, we first propose two control strategies ensuring the state error of DBMC decrease exactly to zero or a desired level manipulated by the user, respectively. To compensate the high feedback gains incurred by these two control strategies, this paper further investigates the nominal DBMC itself. By leveraging small gain based stability tools, this paper also proves the global exponential input-to-state stability of DBMC, outperforming its current stability results. Simulations have been provided to validate the efficacy of our theoretical result.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Resilient Vehicular Platoon Systems over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected vehicular platoons provide a promising solution to improve traffic efficiency and ensure road safety. Vehicles in a platoon utilize on-board sensors and wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links to share traffic information for cooperative adaptive cruise control. To process real-time control and alert information, there is a need to ensure clock synchronization among the platoon's vehicles. However, adversaries can jeopardize the operation of the platoon by attacking the local clocks of vehicles, leading to clock offsets with the platoon's reference clock. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for analyzing the resilience of vehicular platoons that are connected using V2V links. In particular, a resilient design based on a diffusion protocol is proposed to re-synchronize the attacked vehicle through wireless V2V links thereby mitigating the impact of variance of the transmission delay during recovery. Then, a novel metric named temporal conditional mean exceedance is defined and analyzed in order to characterize the resilience of the platoon. Subsequently, the conditions pertaining to the V2V links and recovery time needed for a resilient design are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed resilient design is feasible in face of a nine-fold increase in the variance of transmission delay compared to a baseline designed for reliability. Moreover, the proposed approach improves the reliability, defined as the probability of meeting a desired clock offset error requirement, by 45% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Stable Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Policies from Control Lyapunov Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from expert demonstrations to flexibly program an autonomous system with complex behaviors or to predict an agent's behavior is a powerful tool, especially in collaborative control settings. A common method to solve this problem is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where the observed agent, e.g., a human demonstrator, is assumed to behave according to the optimization of an intrinsic cost function that reflects its intent and informs its control actions. While the framework is expressive, it is also computationally demanding and generally lacks convergence guarantees. We therefore propose a novel, stability-certified IRL approach by reformulating the cost function inference problem to learning control Lyapunov functions (CLF) from demonstrations data. By additionally exploiting closed-form expressions for associated control policies, we are able to efficiently search the space of CLFs by observing the attractor landscape of the induced dynamics. For the construction of the inverse optimal CLFs, we use a Sum of Squares and formulate a convex optimization problem. We present a theoretical analysis of the optimality properties provided by the CLF and evaluate our approach using both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Participation Factors for Power System Oscillation from Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a power system, when the participation factors of generators are computed to rank their participations into an oscillatory mode, a model-based approach is conventionally used on the linearized system model by means of the corresponding right and left eigenvectors. This paper proposes a new approach for estimating participation factors directly from measurement data on generator responses under selected disturbances. The approach computes extended participation factors that coincide with accurate model-based participation factors when the measured responses satisfy an ideally symmetric condition. This paper relaxes this symmetric condition with the original measurement space by identifying and utilizing a coordinate transformation to a new space optimally recovering the symmetry. Thus, the optimal estimates of participation factors solely from measurements are achieved, and the accuracy and influencing factors are discussed. The proposed approach is first demonstrated in detail on a two-area system and then tested on an NPCC 48-machine power system. The penetration of inverter-based resources is also considered.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Automated Driving for Bottleneck Scenarios in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected automated vehicles (CAV), which incorporate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication into their motion planning, are expected to provide a wide range of benefits for individual and overall traffic flow. A frequent constraint or required precondition is that compatible CAVs must already be available in traffic at high penetration rates. Achieving such penetration rates incrementally before providing ample benefits for users presents a chicken-and-egg problem that is common in connected driving development. Based on the example of a cooperative driving function for bottleneck traffic flows (e.g. at a roadblock), we illustrate how such an evolutionary, incremental introduction can be achieved under transparent assumptions and objectives. To this end, we analyze the challenge from the perspectives of automation technology, traffic flow, human factors and market, and present a principle that 1) accounts for individual requirements from each domain; 2) provides benefits for any penetration rate of compatible CAVs between 0 % and 100 % as well as upward-compatibility for expected future developments in traffic; 3) can strictly limit the negative effects of cooperation for any participant and 4) can be implemented with close-to-market technology. We discuss the technical implementation as well as the effect on traffic flow over a wide parameter spectrum for human and technical aspects.</description>

      <title>Show Me the Way: Real-Time Tracking of Wireless Mobile Users with UWB-Enabled RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in 6G wireless networks offers unprecedented control over communication environments. However, identifying optimal configurations within practical constraints remains a significant challenge. This becomes especially pronounced, when the user is mobile and the configurations need to be deployed in real time. Leveraging Ultra-Wideband (UWB) as localization technique, we capture and analyze real-time movements of a user within the RIS-enabled indoor environment. Given this information about the system's geometry, a model-based optimization is utilized, which enables real-time beam steering of the RIS towards the user. However, practical limitations of UWB modules lead to fluctuating UWB estimates, causing the RIS beam to occasionally miss the tracked user. The methodologies proposed in this work aim to increase the compatibility between these two systems. To this end, we provide two key solutions: beam splitting for obtaining more robust RIS configurations and UWB estimation correction for reducing the variations in the UWB data. Through comprehensive theoretical and experimental evaluations in both stationary and mobile scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated. When combined, the proposed methods improve worst-case tracking performance by a significant 17.5dB compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Deep Learning of Mixed-Integer Optimal Control Solutions for Vehicle Decision Making and Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) are a versatile way of formulating vehicle decision making and motion planning problems, where the prediction model is a hybrid dynamical system that involves both discrete and continuous decision variables. However, even the most advanced MIQP solvers can hardly account for the challenging requirements of automotive embedded platforms. Thus, we use machine learning to simplify and hence speed up optimization. Our work builds on recent ideas for solving MIQPs in real-time by training a neural network to predict the optimal values of integer variables and solving the remaining problem by online quadratic programming. Specifically, we propose a recurrent permutation equivariant deep set that is particularly suited for imitating MIQPs that involve many obstacles, which is often the major source of computational burden in motion planning problems. Our framework comprises also a feasibility projector that corrects infeasible predictions of integer variables and considerably increases the likelihood of computing a collision-free trajectory. We evaluate the performance, safety and real-time feasibility of decision-making for autonomous driving using the proposed approach on realistic multi-lane traffic scenarios with interactive agents in SUMO simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is based on a crucial issue in the aviation world: how to optimize the trajectory and controls given to the aircraft in order to optimize flight time and fuel consumption. This study aims to provide elements of a response to this problem and to define, under certain simplifying assumptions, an optimal response, using Constrained Finite Time Optimal Control(CFTOC). The first step is to define the dynamic model of the aircraft in accordance with the controllable inputs and wind disturbances. Then we will identify a precise objective in terms of optimization and implement an optimization program to solve it under the circumstances of simulated real flight situation. Finally, the optimization result is validated and discussed by different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Evaluation of a Lightweight Analytic Vehicle Dynamics Model for Maneuver Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for vehicle dynamics play an important role in maneuver planning for automated driving. They are used to derive trajectories from given control inputs, or to evaluate a given trajectory in terms of constraint violation or optimality criteria such as safety, comfort or ecology. Depending on the computation process, models with different assumptions and levels of detail are used; since maneuver planning usually has strong requirements for computation speed at a potentially high number of trajectory evaluations per planning cycle, most of the applied models aim to reduce complexity by implicitly or explicitly introducing simplifying assumptions. While evaluations show that these assumptions may be sufficiently valid under typical conditions, their effect has yet to be studied conclusively.
  We propose a model for vehicle dynamics that is convenient for maneuver planning by supporting both an analytic approach of extracting parameters from a given trajectory, and a generative approach of establishing a trajectory from given control inputs. Both applications of the model are evaluated in real-world test drives under dynamic conditions, both on a closed-off test track and on public roads, and effects arising from the simplifying assumptions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Realtime Global Optimization of a Fail-Safe Emergency Stop Maneuver for Arbitrary Electrical / Electronical Failures in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the event of a critical system failures in auto-mated vehicles, fail-operational or fail-safe measures provide minimum guarantees for the vehicle's performance, depending on which of its subsystems remain operational. Various such methods have been proposed which, upon failure, use different remaining sets of operational subsystems to execute maneuvers that bring the vehicle into a safe state under different environmental conditions. One particular such method proposes a fail-safe emergency stop system that requires no particular electric or electronic subsystem to be available after failure, and still provides a basic situation-dependent emergency stop maneuver. This is achieved by preemptively setting parameters to a hydraulic / mechanical system prior to failure, which after failure executes the preset maneuver "blindly". The focus of this paper is the particular challenge of implementing a lightweight planning algorithm that can cope with the complex uncertainties of the given task while still providing a globally optimal solution at regular intervals, based on the perceived and predicted environment of the automated vehicle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for training Reinforcement Learning agents using Python in conjunction with Simulink models. Leveraging Python's superior customization options and popular libraries like Stable Baselines3, we aim to bridge the gap between the established Simulink environment and the flexibility of Python for training bleeding edge agents. Our approach is demonstrated on the Quanser Aero 2, a versatile dual-rotor helicopter. We show that policies trained on Simulink models can be seamlessly transferred to the real system, enabling efficient development and deployment of Reinforcement Learning agents for control tasks. Through systematic integration steps, including C-code generation from Simulink, DLL compilation, and Python interface development, we establish a robust framework for training agents on Simulink models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing previous efforts and highlighting the potential of combining Simulink with Python for Reinforcement Learning research and applications.</description>

As the adoption of Open RAN accelerates, ensuring its security becomes critical. The RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) plays a central role in Open RAN by improving network efficiency and flexibility. Nevertheless, it also brings about potential security risks that need careful scrutiny. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the current state of RIC security comprehensively. This assessment is essential to gain a profound understanding of the security considerations associated with RIC. This survey combines a comprehensive analysis of RAN security, tracing its evolution from 2G to 5G, with an in-depth exploration of RIC security, marking the first comprehensive examination of its kind in the literature. Real-world security incidents involving RIC are vividly illustrated, providing practical insights. The study evaluates the security implications of the RIC within the 6G Open RAN context, addressing security vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and potential enhancements. It aims to guide stakeholders in the telecom industry toward a secure and dependable telecommunications infrastructure. The article serves as a valuable reference, shedding light on the RIC's crucial role within the broader network infrastructure and emphasizing security's paramount importance. This survey also explores the promising security opportunities that the RIC presents for enhancing network security and resilience in the context of 6G mobile networks. It outlines open issues, lessons learned, and future research directions in the domain of intelligent control in 6G open RAN, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic landscape.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers Gradient Tracking for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel accelerated distributed algorithm for unconstrained consensus optimization over static undirected networks. The proposed algorithm combines the benefits of acceleration from momentum, the robustness of the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the computational efficiency of gradient tracking to surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in convergence speed, while preserving their computational and communication cost. First, we prove that, by applying momentum on the average dynamic consensus protocol over the estimates and gradient, we can study the algorithm as an interconnection of two singularly perturbed systems: the outer system connects the consensus variables and the optimization variables, and the inner system connects the estimates of the optimum and the auxiliary optimization variables. Next, we prove that, by adding momentum to the auxiliary dynamics, our algorithm always achieves faster convergence than the achievable linear convergence rate for the non-accelerated alternating direction method of multipliers gradient tracking algorithm case. Through simulations, we numerically show that our accelerated algorithm surpasses the existing accelerated and non-accelerated distributed consensus first-order optimization protocols in convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimation and Variance Reduction in Stochastic and Deterministic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It seems that in the current age, computers, computation, and data have an increasingly important role to play in scientific research and discovery. This is reflected in part by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have become great areas of interest not just for computer science but also for many other fields of study. More generally, there have been trends moving towards the use of bigger, more complex and higher capacity models. It also seems that stochastic models, and stochastic variants of existing deterministic models, have become important research directions in various fields. For all of these types of models, gradient-based optimization remains as the dominant paradigm for model fitting, control, and more. This dissertation considers unconstrained, nonlinear optimization problems, with a focus on the gradient itself, that key quantity which enables the solution of such problems.
  In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients. We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases. We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements. In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms. Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator. We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in Sensor Fusion: A Comparative Analysis of Cubature and Sampling-based Integration Methods for Rover Search Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the computational speed and accuracy of two numerical integration methods, cubature and sampling-based, for integrating an integrand over a 2D polygon. Using a group of rovers searching the Martian surface with a limited sensor footprint as a test bed, the relative error and computational time are compared as the area was subdivided to improve accuracy in the sampling-based approach. The results show that the sampling-based approach exhibits a $14.75\%$ deviation in relative error compared to cubature when it matches the computational performance at $100\%$. Furthermore, achieving a relative error below $1\%$ necessitates a $10000\%$ increase in relative time to calculate due to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of the sampling-based method. It is concluded that for enhancing reinforcement learning capabilities and other high iteration algorithms, the cubature method is preferred over the sampling-based method.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Force Observer for Human-Robot Interaction with Series Elastic Actuators using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and adapting to the user's behavior are of paramount importance in physical human-robot interaction. Thus, incorporating elastic actuators in the robot's mechanical design has become popular, since it offers intrinsic compliance and additionally provide a coarse estimate for the interaction force by measuring the deformation of the elastic components. While observer-based methods have been shown to improve these estimates, they rely on accurate models of the system, which are challenging to obtain in complex operating environments. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning the unknown dynamics components using Gaussian process (GP) regression. By employing the learned model in a Bayesian filtering framework, we improve the estimation accuracy and additionally obtain an observer that explicitly considers local model uncertainty in the confidence measure of the state estimate. Furthermore, we derive guaranteed estimation error bounds, thus, facilitating the use in safety-critical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach experimentally in a human-exoskeleton interaction scenario.</description>

      <title>Insights of using Control Theory for minimizing Induced Seismicity in Underground Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture, and Storage and Hydrogen Storage have significant potential to meet the large-scale needs of the energy sector and reduce the CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the earth's crust, upon which these activities rely, can lead to the formation of new seismogenic faults or the reactivation of existing ones, thereby causing earthquakes. In this study, we propose a novel approach based on control theory to address this issue. First, we obtain a simplified model of induced seismicity due to fluid injections in an underground reservoir using a diffusion equation in three dimensions. Then, we design a robust tracking control approach to force the seismicity rate to follow desired references. In this way, the induced seismicity is minimized while ensuring fluid circulation for the needs of renewable energy production and storage. The designed control guarantees the achievement of the control objectives even in the presence of system uncertainties and unknown dynamics. Finally, we present simulations of a simplified geothermal reservoir under different scenarios of energy demand to show the reliability and performance of the control approach, opening new perspectives for field experiments based on real-time regulators.</description>

      <title>K-BMPC: Derivative-based Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive Control for Tractor-Trailer Trajectory Tracking with Unknown Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics bring difficulties to controller design for control-affine systems such as tractor-trailer vehicles, especially when the parameters in the dynamics are unknown. To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy resources in distribution systems necessitates high-speed monitoring and control of voltage for ensuring reliable system operation. However, existing voltage control algorithms often make simplifying assumptions in their formulation, such as real-time availability of smart meter measurements (for monitoring), or real-time knowledge of every power injection information(for control).This paper leverages the recent advances made in highspeed state estimation for real-time unobservable distribution systems to formulate a deep reinforcement learning-based control algorithm that utilizes the state estimates alone to control the voltage of the entire system. The results obtained for a modified (renewable-rich) IEEE34-nodedistributionfeeder indicate that the proposed approach excels in monitoring and controlling voltage of active distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Decentralized Co-Design of Distributed Controllers and Communication Topologies for Vehicular Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular platoons provide an appealing option for future transportation systems. Most of the existing work on platoons separated the design of the controller and its communication topologies. However, it is beneficial to design both the platooning controller and the communication topology simultaneously, i.e., controller and topology co-design, especially in the cases of platoon splitting and merging. We are, therefore, motivated to propose a co-design framework for vehicular platoons that maintains both the compositionality of the controller and the string stability of the platoon, which enables the merging and splitting of the vehicles in a platoon. To this end, we first formulate the co-design problem as a centralized linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem and then decompose it using Sylvester's criterion to obtain a set of smaller decentralized LMI problems that can be solved sequentially at individual vehicles in the platoon. Moreover, in the formulated decentralized LMI problems, we encode a specifically derived local LMI to enforce the $L_2$ stability of the closed-loop platooning system, further implying the $L_2$ weak string stability of the vehicular platoon. Finally, to validate the proposed co-design method and its features in terms of merging/splitting, we provide an extensive collection of simulation results generated from a specifically developed simulation framework. Available in GitHub: HTTP://github.com/NDzsong2/Longitudinal-Vehicular-Platoon-Simulator.git that we have made publicly available.</description>

      <title>State Derivative Normalization for Continuous-Time Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of proper data normalization for deep neural networks is well known. However, in continuous-time state-space model estimation, it has been observed that improper normalization of either the hidden state or hidden state derivative of the model estimate, or even of the time interval can lead to numerical and optimization challenges with deep learning based methods. This results in a reduced model quality. In this contribution, we show that these three normalization tasks are inherently coupled. Due to the existence of this coupling, we propose a solution to all three normalization challenges by introducing a normalization constant at the state derivative level. We show that the appropriate choice of the normalization constant is related to the dynamics of the to-be-identified system and we derive multiple methods of obtaining an effective normalization constant. We compare and discuss all the normalization strategies on a benchmark problem based on experimental data from a cascaded tanks system and compare our results with other methods of the identification literature.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we explore the technical details of the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that were deployed in the largest field test of automated vehicles designed to smooth traffic flow in history as of 2023, uncovering the challenges and breakthroughs that come with developing RL controllers for automated vehicles. We delve into the fundamental concepts behind RL algorithms and their application in the context of self-driving cars, discussing the developmental process from simulation to deployment in detail, from designing simulators to reward function shaping. We present the results in both simulation and deployment, discussing the flow-smoothing benefits of the RL controller. From understanding the basics of Markov decision processes to exploring advanced techniques such as deep RL, our article offers a comprehensive overview and deep dive of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations driving this rapidly evolving field. We also showcase real-world case studies and alternative research projects that highlight the impact of RL controllers in revolutionizing autonomous driving. From tackling complex urban environments to dealing with unpredictable traffic scenarios, these intelligent controllers are pushing the boundaries of what automated vehicles can achieve. Furthermore, we examine the safety considerations and hardware-focused technical details surrounding deployment of RL controllers into automated vehicles. As these algorithms learn and evolve through interactions with the environment, ensuring their behavior aligns with safety standards becomes crucial. We explore the methodologies and frameworks being developed to address these challenges, emphasizing the importance of building reliable control systems for automated vehicles.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for the stability and $\ell_2$-gain performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ReLU activation functions. These conditions are derived by combining Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with Quadratic Constraints (QCs) satisfied by repeated ReLUs. We write a general class of QCs for repeated RELUs using known properties for the scalar ReLU. Our stability and performance condition uses these QCs along with a "lifted" representation for the ReLU RNN. We show that the positive homogeneity property satisfied by a scalar ReLU does not expand the class of QCs for the repeated ReLU. We present examples to demonstrate the stability / performance condition and study the effect of the lifting horizon.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Variance Recursive State Estimation for 2-D Systems: When Asynchronous Multi-Channel Delays meet Energy Harvesting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for two-dimensional systems with asynchronous multichannel delays and energy harvesting constraints. In the system, each smart sensor has a certain probability of harvesting energy from the external environment, the authorized transmission between the sensor and the remote filter is contingent upon the current energy level of the sensor, which results in intermittent transmission of observation information. Addressing the issue of incomplete observation information due to asynchronous multi-channel delays, a novel approach for observation partition reconstruction is proposed to convert the delayed activated observation sequences into equivalent delay-free activated observation sequences. Through generating spatial equivalency validation, it is found that the reconstructed delay-free activated observation sequences contain the same information as the original delayed activated observation sequences. Based on the reconstructed activated observation sequence and activated probability, a novel unbiased h+1-step recursive estimator is constructed. Then, the evolution of the probability distribution of the energy level is discussed. The estimation gains are obtained by minimizing the filtering error covariance. Subsequently, through parameter assumptions, a uniform lower bound and a recursive upper bound for the filtering error covariance are presented. And the monotonicity analysis of activated probability on estimation performance is given. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme is verified through a numerical simulation example.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Bilevel Programming for Stackelberg Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Stackelberg congestion game (SCG), a leader aims to maximize their own gain by anticipating and manipulating the equilibrium state at which the followers settle by playing a congestion game. Often formulated as bilevel programs, large-scale SCGs are well known for their intractability and complexity. Here, we attempt to tackle this computational challenge by marrying traditional methodologies with the latest differentiable programming techniques in machine learning. The core idea centers on replacing the lower-level equilibrium problem with a smooth evolution trajectory defined by the imitative logit dynamic (ILD), which we prove converges to the equilibrium of the congestion game under mild conditions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose two new local search algorithms for SCGs. The first is a gradient descent algorithm that obtains the derivatives by unrolling ILD via differentiable programming. Thanks to the smoothness of ILD, the algorithm promises both efficiency and scalability. The second algorithm adds a heuristic twist by cutting short the followers' evolution trajectory. Behaviorally, this means that, instead of anticipating the followers' best response at equilibrium, the leader seeks to approximate that response by only looking ahead a limited number of steps. Our numerical experiments are carried out over various instances of classic SCG applications, ranging from toy benchmarks to large-scale real-world examples. The results show the proposed algorithms are reliable and scalable local solvers that deliver high-quality solutions with greater regularity and significantly less computational effort compared to the many incumbents included in our study.</description>

      <title>Bandits for Sponsored Search Auctions under Unknown Valuation Model: Case Study in E-Commerce Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a bidding system for sponsored search auctions under an unknown valuation model. This formulation assumes that the bidder's value is unknown, evolving arbitrarily, and observed only upon winning an auction. Unlike previous studies, we do not impose any assumptions on the nature of feedback and consider the problem of bidding in sponsored search auctions in its full generality. Our system is based on a bandit framework that is resilient to the black-box auction structure and delayed and batched feedback. To validate our proposed solution, we conducted a case study at Zalando, a leading fashion e-commerce company. We outline the development process and describe the promising outcomes of our bandits-based approach to increase profitability in sponsored search auctions. We discuss in detail the technical challenges that were overcome during the implementation, shedding light on the mechanisms that led to increased profitability.</description>

      <title>Low-rank approximated Kalman-Bucy filters using Oja's principal component flow for linear time-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman-Bucy filter is extensively utilized across various applications. However, its computational complexity increases significantly in large-scale systems. To mitigate this challenge, a low-rank approximated Kalman--Bucy filter was proposed, comprising Oja's principal component flow and a low-dimensional Riccati differential equation. Previously, the estimation error was confirmed solely for linear time-invariant systems with a symmetric system matrix. This study extends the application by eliminating the constraint on the symmetricity of the system matrix and describes the equilibrium points of the Oja flow along with their stability for general matrices. In addition, the domain of attraction for a set of stable equilibrium points is estimated. Based on these findings, we demonstrate that the low-rank approximated Kalman--Bucy filter with a suitable rank maintains a bounded estimation error covariance matrix if the system is controllable and observable.</description>
