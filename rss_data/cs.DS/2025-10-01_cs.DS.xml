      <title>Designing Compact ILPs via Fast Witness Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard formalization of preprocessing in parameterized complexity is given by kernelization. In this work, we depart from this paradigm and study a different type of preprocessing for problems without polynomial kernels, still aiming at producing instances that are easily solvable in practice. Specifically, we ask for which parameterized problems an instance (I,k) can be reduced in polynomial time to an integer linear program (ILP) with poly(k) constraints.
  We show that this property coincides with the parameterized complexity class WK[1], previously studied in the context of Turing kernelization lower bounds. In turn, the class WK[1] enjoys an elegant characterization in terms of witness verification protocols: a yes-instance should admit a witness of size poly(k) that can be verified in time poly(k). By combining known data structures with new ideas, we design such protocols for several problems, such as r-Way Cut, Vertex Multiway Cut, Steiner Tree, or Minimum Common String Partition, thus showing that they can be modeled by compact ILPs. We also present explicit ILP and MILP formulations for Weighted Vertex Cover on graphs with small (unweighted) vertex cover number. We believe that these results will provide a background for a systematic study of ILP-oriented preprocessing procedures for parameterized problems.</description>

      <title>A Polylogarithmic Competitive Algorithm for Stochastic Online Sorting and TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \emph{Online Sorting}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At each time step $t$, an element $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed irrevocably into an empty cell without any knowledge of future arrivals. We aim to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements placed in consecutive array cells, seeking an online placement strategy that results in a final array close to a sorted one. An interesting multidimensional generalization, a.k.a. the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem}, arises when the request sequence consists of points in the $d$-dimensional unit cube and the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances between points in consecutive cells. Motivated by the recent work of (Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen and Kozma; ESA 2024), we consider the \emph{stochastic version} of Online Sorting (\textit{resp.} Online TSP), where each element (\textit{resp.} point) $x_t$ is an i.i.d. sample from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$ (\textit{resp.} $[0,1]^d$). By carefully decomposing the request sequence into a hierarchy of balls-into-bins instances, where the balls to bins ratio is large enough so that bin occupancy is sharply concentrated around its mean and small enough so that we can efficiently deal with the elements placed in the same bin, we obtain an online algorithm that approximates the optimal cost within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ with high probability. Our result comprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen et al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to (Bertram, ESA 2025).</description>

      <title>On Computing Top-$k$ Simple Shortest Paths from a Single Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand, we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time, achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$ simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation for Broadcasting in k-cycle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadcasting is an information dissemination primitive where a message originates at a node (called the originator) and is passed to all other nodes in the network. Broadcasting research is motivated by efficient network design and determining the broadcast times of standard network topologies. Verifying the broadcast time of a node $v$ in an arbitrary network $G$ is known to be NP-hard. Additionally, recent findings show that the broadcast time problem is also NP-complete in general cactus graphs and some highly restricted subfamilies of cactus graphs. These graph families are structurally similar to $k$-cycle graphs, in which the broadcast time problem is also believed to be NP-complete. In this paper, we present a simple $(1.5-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for determining the broadcast time of networks modeled using $k$-cycle graphs, where $\epsilon &gt; 0$ depends on the structure of the graph.</description>

      <title>Signal-Aware Workload Shifting Algorithms with Uncertainty-Quantified Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use electricity prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values are typically available, prior work on learning-augmented online algorithms has relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the forecasting research has made significant progress in uncertainty quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage UQ predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts through a $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing $\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation Algorithms for Fair Influence Maximization under Maximin Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to reduce disparities of influence across different groups, Fair Influence Maximization (FIM) has recently garnered widespread attention. The maximin constraint, a common notion of fairness adopted in the FIM problem, imposes a direct and intuitive requirement that asks the utility (influenced ratio within a group) of the worst-off group should be maximized. Although the objective of FIM under maximin constraint is conceptually straightforward, the development of efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the maximin objective does not satisfy submodularity, a key property for designing approximate algorithms in traditional influence maximization settings. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a two-step optimization framework consisting of Inner-group Maximization (IGM) and Across-group Maximization (AGM). We first prove that the influence spread within any individual group remains submodular, enabling effective optimization within groups. Based on this, IGM applies a greedy approach to pick high-quality seeds for each group. In the second step, AGM coordinates seed selection across groups by introducing two strategies: Uniform Selection (US) and Greedy Selection (GS). We prove that AGM-GS holds a $(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ approximation to the optimal solution when groups are completely disconnected, while AGM-US guarantees a roughly $\frac{1}{m}(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ lower bound regardless of the group structure, with $m$ denoting the number of groups</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. Revisiting spectral algorithms for Sparsest Cut, we present a novel, simple algorithm that combines eigenspace enumeration with a new algorithm for the Cut Improvement problem. The runtime of our algorithm is parametrized by a quantity that we call the solution dimension $\text{SD}_\varepsilon(G)$: the smallest $k$ such that the subspace spanned by the first $k$ Laplacian eigenvectors contains all but $\varepsilon$ fraction of a sparsest cut. Our algorithm matches the guarantees of prior methods based on the threshold-rank paradigm, while also extending beyond them. To illustrate this, we study its performance on low degree Cayley graphs over Abelian groups -- canonical examples of graphs with poor expansion properties. We prove that low degree Abelian Cayley graphs have small solution dimension, yielding an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the uniform Sparsest Cut of a degree-$d$ Cayley graph over an Abelian group of size $n$ in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$. Along the way to bounding the solution dimension of Abelian Cayley graphs, we analyze their sparse cuts and spectra, proving that the collection of $O(1)$-approximate sparsest cuts has an $\varepsilon$-net of size $\exp(d/\varepsilon)^{O(d)}$ and that the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ is bounded by $2^{O(d)}$. The latter bound is tight and improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Searching in trees with $k$-up-modular cost functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following generalization of the classic binary search problem: a searcher is required to find a hidden vertex $x$ in a tree $T$. To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle, each about a chosen vertex $v$. After each such call, the oracle responds whether the target was found and if not, the searcher receives as a reply the connected component of $T-v$ which contains $x$. Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $c(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy which minimizes the worst case cost required to find $x$. The problem is known to be NP-hard even in restricted classes of trees such as bounded diameter spiders [Cicalese et al. 2016], and no constant factor approximation algorithm is known for general trees. Following the recent studies of [Dereniowski et al. 2022, Dereniowski et al. 2024], instead of restricted classes of trees, we explore restrictions on the cost function. We generalize the notion of up-monotonic functions and introduce the concept of \textit{$k$-up-modularity}. We show that an $O(\log\log n)$-approximate solution can be found within $k^{O(\log k)}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$ time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information designers, such as online platforms, often do not know the beliefs of their receivers. We design learning algorithms so that the information designer can learn the receivers' prior belief from their actions through repeated interactions. Our learning algorithms achieve no regret relative to the optimality for the known prior at a fast speed, achieving a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log T)$ in general and a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log \log T)$ in the important special case of binary actions.</description>

      <title>No Quantum Advantage in Decoded Quantum Interferometry for MaxCut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a framework for approximating special kinds of discrete optimization problems that relies on problem structure in a way that sets it apart from other classical or quantum approaches. We show that the instances of MaxCut on which DQI attains a nontrivial asymptotic approximation guarantee are solvable exactly in classical polynomial time. We include a streamlined exposition of DQI tailored for MaxCut that relies on elementary graph theory instead of coding theory to motivate and explain the algorithm.</description>
