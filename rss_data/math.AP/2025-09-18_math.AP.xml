      <title>Global propagation of singularities for magnetic mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that singularities propagate globally for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations related to magnetic mechanical systems on closed Riemannian manifolds. Our main result shows that for any weak KAM solution $u$, the singular set $\text{Sing}\,(u)$ remains invariant under the generalized gradient flow dynamics. The proof combines three key elements: (1) reduction from magnetic to Riemannian systems, (2) analysis of reparameterized flows, and (3) regularization techniques. Compared to previous analytic approaches, our geometric method provides clearer insights into the underlying Riemannian structure. We also establish necessary conditions for singularity existence, particularly when the Euler characteristic is nonzero and the magnetic form is non-exact. This approach does not extend directly to Finsler metrics due to structural differences.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the $1d$ NLS with inhomogeneous nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove large-data scattering in $H^1$ for inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in one space dimension for powers $p&gt;2$. We assume the inhomogeneity is nonnegative and repulsive; we additionally require decay at infinity in the case $2&lt;p\leq 4$. We use the method of concentration-compactness and contradiction, utilizing a Morawetz estimate in the style of Nakanishi in order to preclude the existence of compact solutions.</description>

      <title>Critical p-biharmonic problems and applications to Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fourth-order quasilinear elliptic problems that involve the p-biharmonic operator and Navier boundary conditions. The nonlinear term grows at the critical Sobolev rate. Starting from a Hamiltonian system of two second-order equations, we use an inversion step to reduce it to a single p-biharmonic equation with a lower-order perturbation. We handle both non-resonant and resonant cases and show that the problem admits non-trivial solutions when the forcing term and the superscaled perturbation are small enough. The proof combines concentration-compactness with an abstract critical point method based on the cohomological index. Our theorems cover both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous settings and extend Tarantello's classical results for the Laplacian, improving earlier work on p-biharmonic equations (including the case p = 2) and on critical Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Homogeneous Complex Monge-Ampere Equations on ALE Kahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to the author's earlier work and investigates the homogeneous complex Monge--Ampere equation (HCMA) on the product space $X \times D$, where $X$ is an asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) Kahler manifold and $D subset C$ is the unit disc. We establish precise asymptotic behavior of the solution to the HCMA equation, showing that the decay rate of the solution matches that of the prescribed boundary data and that uniform control in weighted Holder norms can be achieved.
  The analysis combines two main ingredients: a redevelopment of pluripotential theory on the noncompact space $X \times D$ and a PDE-based construction of holomorphic disc foliations on the end of $X$, inspired by the works of Semmes and Donaldson. As an application in general Kahler manifolds, the techniques developed in this paper also imply a local regularity result for the HCMA equation.</description>

      <title>Local energy decay for 2-D wave equations with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the two-dimensional initial value problem in ${\bf R}^{2}$ for the wave equation with varying spatial coefficients in the main part. Assuming compactness in the support of the initial value, we report that the corresponding local energy decays to an order of magnitude of, for example, $O(t^{-1}\sqrt{\log t})$ after sufficiently large time. For the two-dimensional whole space case, it is crucial to establish the optimal $L^2$-estimate for the solution itself, skillfully avoiding the difficulty of not being able to use useful inequalities such as Hardy-type inequalities in higher dimensional case. We also consider cases where the variable coefficients are slightly generalized. These proofs are developed using the multiplier method.</description>

      <title>Fast energy decay for 2-D wave equation with localized damping near spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for wave equations with localized damping in ${\bf R}^{2}$. The damping is effective only near spatial infinity. We obtain fast energy decay estimate such that $O(t^{-2}\log t)$ as $t \to \infty$. Unlike the results for the two-dimensional exterior mixed problem case, the difficulty of not being able to use Hardy-type inequalities is overcome by using Poincar\'e-type inequalities in all spaces and the finite propagation property of the solution to construct an estimate formula. In the two-dimensional case, when comparing the problem in the whole space with that in the exterior domain, we find that there is a significant difference in the sense that the former requires a logarithmic correction to the energy decay rate.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to Kirchhoff equation with the Sobolev critical exponent in high dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following well-known Kirchhoff equation with the Sobolev critical exponent has been extensively studied,
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Big(a+b\int_{\mathbb R^N} | \nabla u|^2dx\Big) \Delta u+\lambda u=\mu |u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2^*-2}u \ \ {\rm in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^N, \ \ N\geq4, 
  \end{equation*} having prescribed mass $\int_{\mathbb R^N}|u|^2dx=c$, where $a$, $c$ are two positive constants, $b,\mu$ are two parameters, $\lambda$ appears as a real Lagrange multiplier and $2&lt;q&lt;2^*$, $2^*$ is the Sobolev critical exponent. Firstly, for the special case $\mu=0$ and $N\geq4$, the above equation reduces to a pure critical Kirchhoff equation, we obtain a complete conclusion including the existence, nonexistence and multiplicity of the normalized solutions by the variational methods. Secondly, when $\mu&gt;0$, $N\geq5$ and $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$, we investigate the existence of the positive normalize solution under suitable assumptions on parameter $b$ and mass $c$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to consider the above case, which is a more complicated case not only the difficulties on checking the Palais-Smale condition, but also the constraint functional requesting the intricate concave-convex structure. Lastly, when $\mu&gt;0$ and $N=4$, we obtain a local minimizer solution and a mountain pass solution under explicit conditions on $b$ and $c$. It is worth noting that the second solution is obtained by introducing a new functional to establish a threshold for the mountain pass level, which is the key step for the fulfillment of the Palais-Smale condition. This paper provides a refinement and extension of the results of the normalized solutions for Kirchhoff type problem in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>The Correspondence Principle: A bridge between general potential theories and nonlinear elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General potential theories concern the study of functions which are subharmonic with respect to a suitable constraint set (called a subequation) in the space of 2-jets. While interesting in their own right, general potential theories are being widely used to study fully nonlinear PDEs determined by degenerate elliptic operators acting on the space of 2-jets. We will discuss a powerful tool, the correspondence principle, which establishes the equivalence between subequation subharmonics (superharmonics) and admissible subsolutions (supersolutions) in the viscosity sense of the PDE determined by every operator which is compatible with a given subequation. The crucial degenerate ellipticity often requires the operator to be restricted to a suitable constraint set, which determines the admissibility. Applications to comparison principles by way of the duality monotonicity fiberegularity method will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>MUSIC algorithm for locating point-like scatterers with multiple interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of locating point sources from far-field data under plane wave incidence. A direct computational method is developed based on multiple scattering theory, using a novel indicator function to avoid iterative solving. The approach is efficient, noise-stable, and capable of resolving closely spaced or multiple sources. Numerical results validate its accuracy and robustness in various configurations. This work provides a practical computational tool for wave-based imaging and non-destructive evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior in the sense of $\Gamma(L^1_{loc})$-convergence as $s\to1^-$ of anisotropic non local $s$-fractional perimeters defined with respect to general anisotropic integration kernels $k_s(\cdot)$, under the hypothesis of pointwise convergence of such kernels. In particular, we prove the $\Gamma(L^1_{loc})$-convergence as $s\to1^-$ of the rescaled anisotropic nonlocal $s$-fractional perimeters defined with respect to the kernels $k_s(\cdot)$ to a suitable anisotropic perimeter. We do so both in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>Global stability of the inhomogeneous sheared Boltzmann equation in torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homo-energetic solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation have been extensively studied, but their global stability in the inhomogeneous setting remains challenging due to unbounded energy growth under self-similar scaling and the intricate interplay between spatial dependence and nonlinear collision dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an approach for periodic spatial domains to construct global-in-time inhomogeneous solutions in a non-conservative perturbation framework, characterizing the global dynamics of growing energy. The growth of energy is shown to be governed by a long-time limit state that exhibits features not captured in either the homogeneous case or the classical Boltzmann theory. The core of our proof is the derivation of new energy estimates specific to the Maxwell molecule model. These estimates combine three key ingredients: a low-high frequency decomposition, a spectral analysis of the matrix associated with the second-order moment equation, and a crucial cancellation property in the zero-frequency mode of the nonlinear collision term. This last property bears a close analogy to the null condition in nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of strong degeneracy region for parabolic equations and systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of recovering a degeneracy point within the diffusion coefficient of a one-dimensional complex parabolic equation by observing the normal derivative at one point of the boundary. The strongly degenerate case is analyzed. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions on the initial data that guarantee the stability and uniqueness of the solution obtained from a one-point measurement. Moreover, we present more general uniqueness theorems, which also cover the identification of the initial data and the coefficient of the zero order term, using measurements taken over time. Our method is based on a careful analysis of the spectral problem and relies on an explicit form of the solution in terms of Bessel functions. Our investigation also covers the case of real 1-D degenerate parabolic systems of equations coupled with a specific structure. Theoretical results are also supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its importance, there have been few PDE results to investigate Prandtl layers for compressible fluids, in which the thermal boundary layer for the temperature field interacts with the classical velocity Prandtl boundary layer in a strong nonlinear fashion. We establish local-in-$x$ well-posedness of Prandtl layers for steady compressible fluids and construct Prandtl layer expansion in strong Sobolev norms, a foundation for the validity of Prandtl layer theory \cite{Guo-Wang}. Our method is based on a combination of the recent quotient estimate for the velocity field and an introduction of a pseudo entropy estimate for the temperature field.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for first-order mean-field systems with non-attractive moderately singular interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider particle systems that evolve by inertialess binary interaction through general non-attractive kernels of singularity $|x|^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;d-1$. We prove a quantitative mean-field limit in terms of Wasserstein distances under certain conditions on the initial configuration while maintaining control of the particle configuration in the form of the minimal distance and certain singular sums of the particle distances. As a corollary, we show propagation of chaos for $\alpha&lt;\frac{d-1}{2}$ for $d\ge 3$ and $\alpha&lt;\frac 13=\frac{2d-3}{3}$ for $d=2$. This extends the results of Hauray (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218202509003814), which yield propagation of chaos for $\alpha &lt; \frac{d-2}{2}$ without an assumption on the sign of the interaction. The main novel ingredient is that due to the non-attraction property it is enough to control the distance to the next-to-nearest neighbour particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-diffusion systems are formally derived from multispecies kinetic models in the diffusion limit. The first limit in the multispecies BGK model of Gross and Krook leads to a variant of the non-isothermal Maxwell-Stefan equations. The second limit in a BGK model with Brinkman-type force term yields generalized Busenberg-Travis equations, which reduce for constant temperature to the classical Busenberg-Travis system for segregating population species. Entropy equalities are derived for the kinetic and cross-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>The zero-dispersion limit for the Benjamin--Ono equation on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the explicit formula of P. G\'erard, we characterize the zero-dispersion limit for solutions of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}= \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ with bounded initial data $u_0\in L^\infty(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{R})$. The result generalizes the work of L. Gassot, who focused on periodic bell-shaped data, and complements the work of G\'erard and X. Chen who identified the zero-dispersion limit on the line with $u_0\in L^2\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Here, as well as in the mentioned cases, the characterization agrees with the one first obtained by Miller--Xu for bell-shaped data on the line: The zero-dispersion limit is given as an alternating sum of the characteristics appearing in the (multivalued) solution of Burgers' equation. From this characterization, we compute regularity properties of the zero-dispersion limit, including maximum principles and an Oleinik estimate.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of Benjamin--Ono multisolitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that multisoliton solutions to the Benjamin--Ono equation are uniformly orbitally stable in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for every $-\tfrac12&lt;s\leq \frac12$. This improves the regularity required for stability up to the sharp well-posedness threshold; previous work (even on single solitons) had required $s\geq \frac12$.
  One key ingredient in our argument is a new variational characterization of multisolitons. A second ingredient is the extension to low-regularity slowly-decaying solutions of the Wu identity on eigenfunctions of the Lax operator. This extension also allows us to clarify the spectral type of the Lax operator for such potentials by precluding embedded eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Unstable Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether singularities can form in fluids remains a foundational unanswered question in mathematics. This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing equations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from smooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily identified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for key open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases, where unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we present the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the initial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are exceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite precision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations immediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we present multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible porous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a simple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of instability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and training schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving accuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered solutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine precision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off errors of the GPU hardware. This level of precision meets the requirements for rigorous mathematical validation via computer-assisted proofs. This work provides a new playbook for exploring the complex landscape of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling long-standing challenges in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>HYCO: Hybrid-Cooperative Learning for Data-Driven PDE Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), a hybrid modeling framework that iteratively integrates physics-based and data-driven models through a mutual regularization mechanism. Unlike traditional approaches that impose physical constraints directly on synthetic models, HYCO treats the physical and synthetic components as co-trained agents: the physical and synthetic models are nudged toward agreement, while the synthetic model is enhanced to better fit the available data. This cooperative learning scheme is naturally parallelizable and improves robustness to noise as well as to sparse or heterogeneous data. Extensive numerical experiments on both static and time-dependent problems demonstrate that HYCO outperforms classical physics-based and data-driven methods, recovering accurate solutions and model parameters even under ill-posed conditions. The method also admits a natural game-theoretic interpretation, enabling alternating optimization and paving the way for future theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>A numerical scheme for a fully nonlinear free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to approximate viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear free transmission problems. The method discretises a two-layer regularisation of a PDE, involving a functional and a vanishing parameter. The former is handled via a fixed-point argument. We then prove that the numerical method converges to a one-parameter regularisation of the free boundary problem. Regularity estimates enable us to take the vanishing limit of such a parameter and recover a viscosity solution of the free transmission problem. Our main contribution is the design of a computational strategy, based on fixed-point arguments and approximated problems, to solve fully nonlinear free boundary models. We finish the paper with two numerical examples to validate our method.</description>

      <title>Elliptic differential-operator with an abstract Robin boundary condition containing two spectral parameters, study in a non commutative framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the solvability of boundary-value problems for differential-operator equations of the second order in L p (0, 1; X), with 1 &lt; p &lt; +$\infty$, X being a UMD complex Banach space. The originality of this work lies in the fact that we have considered the case when spectral complex parameters appear in the equation and in the abstract Robin boundary condition illustrated by some unbounded operator non commuting with the one used in the equation. Existence, uniqueness, representation formula, maximal regularity of the solution, sharp estimates and generation of strongly continuous analytic semigroup are proved. Many concrete applications are given for which our theory applies. This work gives news considerations with respect to all those studied by the authors in [7] and is a continuation, in some sense, of the results in [1] studied in Hilbertian spaces.</description>

      <title>Global existence and pointwise decay for nonlinear waves under the null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves global existence and sharp pointwise decay for solutions to nonlinear wave equations satisfying the semilinear null condition, on a class of three-dimensional, asymptotically flat, and notably, non-stationary spacetimes. We consider nonlinearities satisfying a generalized null condition which does not necessarily retain its structure when commuted with vector fields. For sufficiently small initial data, and under the assumption that the underlying linear operator satisfies an integrated local energy decay estimate, we prove that solutions exist for all time and we establish sharp pointwise decay estimates for the solution $\phi$ and its vector-fields. The solution itself decays as $|\phi(t,x)| \lesssim \langle t+r \rangle^{-1} \langle t-r \rangle^{-1}$. This rate matches that of the nonlinear equation on a flat background. This rate is sharp, as this behavior holds already for certain time-dependent perturbations of the classical null form on Minkowski space, which we specify.</description>

Abstract: We consider one dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Oldroyd-type constitutive law. By establishing uniform a priori estimates (with respect to relaxation time), we show global existence of smooth solutions with small initial data. Moreover, we get global-in-time convergence of the system towards the classical isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem For Quasi-Linear Parabolic Systems Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of parabolic quasilinear systems, in which the diffusion matrix is not uniformly elliptic, but satisfies a Petrovskii condition of positivity of the real part of the eigenvalues. Local wellposedness is known since the work of Amann in the 90s, by a semi-group method. We first revisit these results in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on $L^2$ and then explore the endpoint Besov case $B_{p,1}^{d/p}$. We also exemplify our method on the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative, strong solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary regularity and Green function estimates for nonlocal equations in divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove for the first time the $C^s$ boundary regularity for solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations with H\"older continuous coefficients in divergence form in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains. So far, it was only known that solutions are H\"older continuous up to the boundary, and establishing their optimal regularity has remained an open problem in the field. Our proof is based on a delicate higher order Campanato-type iteration at the boundary, which we develop in the context of nonlocal equations and which is quite different from the local theory.
  As an application of our results, we establish sharp two-sided Green function estimates in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains for the same class of operators. Previously, this was only known under additional structural assumptions on the coefficients and in more regular domains.</description>

      <title>Refining H\"older regularity theory in degenerate drift-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the H\"older continuity of bounded nonnegative weak solutions to \begin{align*} \big(\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)_t=\Delta w+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)+b\big(x,t,\Phi^{-1}(w)\big), \end{align*} with convex $\Phi\in C^0([0,\infty))\cap C^2((0,\infty))$ satisfying $\Phi(0)=0$, $\Phi'&gt;0$ on $(0,\infty)$ and $$s\Phi''(s)\leq C\Phi'(s)\quad\text{for all }s\in[0,s_0]$$ for some $C&gt;0$ and $s_0\in(0,1]$. The functions $a$ and $b$ are only assumed to satisfy integrability conditions of the form \begin{align*} a&amp;\in L^{2q_1}\big((0,T);L^{2q_2}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^N)\big),\\ b&amp;\in M\big(\Omega_T\times\mathbb{R}\big)\ \text{such that }\big|b(x,t,\xi)\big|\leq \hat{b}(x,t)\ \text{a.e. for some }\hat{b}\in L^{q_1}\big((0,T);L^{q_2}(\Omega)\big) \end{align*} with $q_1,q_2&gt;1$ such that $$\frac{2}{q_1}+\frac{N}{q_2}=2-N\kappa\quad\text{for some }\kappa\in(0,\tfrac{2}{N}).$$ Letting $w=\Phi(u)$ and assuming the inverse $\Phi^{-1}:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ to be locally H\"older continuous, this entails H\"older regularity for bounded weak solutions of $$u_t=\Delta\Phi(u)+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)u\big)+b(x,t,u)$$ and, accordingly, covers a wide array of taxis type structures. In particular, many chemotaxis frameworks with nonlinear diffusion, which cannot be covered by the standard literature, fall into this category.
  After rigorously treating local H\"older regularity, we also extend the regularity result to the associated initial-boundary value problem for boundary conditions of flux-type.</description>

Abstract: We study evolutionary equations in exponentially weighted $\mathrm{L}^{2}$-spaces as introduced by Picard in 2009. First, for a given evolutionary equation, we explicitly describe the $\nu$-adjoint system, which turns out to describe a system backwards in time. We prove well-posedness for the $\nu$-adjoint system. We then apply the thus obtained duality to introduce and study notions of null-controllability for evolutionary equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the weighted estimates and the solvability of time-fractional parabolic equations. The leading coefficients \(a^{ij}(t,x)\) are assumed to have small mean oscillations in \((t,x)\) locally, in both non-divergence and divergence forms, in the whole space. By employing appropriate odd and even extensions along with suitable boundary value conditions, we derive the corresponding results for the half-space. The proofs rely on the application of the Fefferman-Stein theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem in the context of weighted mixed spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp energy decay rates for the damped wave equation on the torus via non-polynomial derivative bound conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the damped wave equation on the torus, when some geodesics never meet the positive set of the damping, energy decay rates are known to depend on derivative bounds and growth properties of the damping near the boundary of its support, as well as the geometry of the support of the damping. In this paper we obtain, sometimes sharp, energy decay rates for damping which satisfy more general non-polynomial derivative bounds and growth properties. We also show how these rates can depend on the geometry of the support of the damping. We prove general results and apply them to examples of damping growing exponentially slowly, polynomial-logarithmically, or logarithmically. The decay rates found for these examples interpolate between known sharp rates for purely polynomial damping. The proof relies on estimating the solution at very fine, non-poynomial, semiclassical scales to obtain resolvent estimates, which are then converted to energy decay rates via semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on Non-Compact Metric Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states in terms of the spectral properties of the underlying Hamiltonian: ground states exist if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is negative and the frequency lies within a suitable range. We further explore the relation between action and energy ground states, showing that while every action minimizer yields an energy minimizer, the converse fails in general. In particular, we prove that energy ground states may not exist for arbitrary masses. This discrepancy is illustrated through explicit examples on star graphs with $\delta$ and $\delta'$-type vertex conditions: in the mass-subcritical case, we exhibit a large interval of masses for which no energy minimizer exists, whereas in the supercritical regime, energy ground states exist for all masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.</description>

Abstract: We study the solution theory of the whole-space static (elliptic) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in spectral Barron spaces. We prove that under the assumption that the coefficients involved are spectral Barron functions and the discount factor is sufficiently large, there exists a sequence of uniformly bounded spectral Barron functions that converges locally uniformly to the solution. As a consequence, the solution of the HJB equation can be approximated by two-layer neural networks without curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>The Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic problem for the Logarithmic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the non-local analogue of Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type elliptic equations involving the logarithmic Laplacian and critical logarithmic non-linearity with superlinear-subcritical perturbation.
  In the first part of this work, we derive new sharp, continuous and compact embeddings of nonlocal Sobolev spaces (of order zero) into Orlicz type spaces. As an application of these embeddings and variational analysis as carried out in \cite{Angeles-Saldana-2023, Santamaria-Saldana-2022}, we prove the existence of a least energy weak solution of the Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian. For the uniqueness of solution, we prove a new D\'iaz-Saa type inequality, which is of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems.
  In the second part of the work, depending upon the growth of non-linearity and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of non-local weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that least energy solutions of a weighted non-local fractional problem with superlinear or sublinear type non-linearity converge to a non-trivial, non-negative least energy solution of a Brezis-Nirenberg type or logistic-type problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness of the full coupled Navier-Stokes and Q-tensor system in dimension three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the weak-strong uniqueness for the Leray-Hopf type weak solutions to the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an arbitrary parameter $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$, which measures the ratio of tumbling and alignment effects caused by the flow. This result is obtained by proposing a new uniqueness criterion in terms of $(\Delta Q,\nabla u)$ with regularity $L_t^qL_x^p$ for $\frac{2}{q}+\frac{3}{p}=\frac{3}{2}$ and $2\leq p\leq 6$, which enable us to deal with the additional nonlinear difficulties arising from the parameter $\xi$. Comparing with the results of related literature, our finding also reveals a new regime of weak-strong uniqueness for the simplified case of $\xi=0$. Moreover, we establish the global well-posedness of this model for small initial data in $H^s$-framework.</description>

      <title>Estimates for pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper finishes the goal of the authors started in two previous manuscripts dedicated to revisiting the continuity properties of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with symbols in the H\"ormander classes. Here we prove pointwise estimates in terms of the Fefferman-Stein sharp maximal function and of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Combining these estimates with the properties of Muckenhoupt's weight class $A_p$ we obtain boundedness theorems for pseudo-differential operators between weighted Lebesgue spaces on the torus $L^p(w)$. These results are given in the context of the global symbolic analysis defined on $\mathbb{T}^n\times \mathbb{Z}^n$ as developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen by using discrete Fourier analysis, and extend those of Park and Tomita available in the Euclidean case. Moreover, we include continuity results on Sobolev spaces $W^s_p$ and on Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}$ on the torus. Our techniques are taken from Park and Tomita \cite{park-tomita} and we consider its toroidal extension here for the completeness of the boundedness of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with respect to the current literature.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of principal eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a class of elliptic operators with degenerate large advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study, both numerically and analytically, the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenfunction of \eqref{1.1}, normalized by \eqref{1.2}, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. Based on the numerical computations of this paper, we can prove that, under condition (Hm) bellow, $\varphi_s$ approximates $1$ and $\varphi_s'$ approximates $0$, uniformly in $[-1,1]$, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. As a byproduct of this result, we can derive the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue in a one-dimensional situation not previously covered by \cite{ChLo} and \cite{PeZh}, as we are working under minimal regularity assumptions on $m(x)$. A recent result of \cite{BWZ} shows that the principal eigenvalue might oscillate as $s\uparrow +\infty$ if $m(x)$ is highly oscillatory. Thus, the oscillatory and regularity properties of $m(x)$ might severely affect the asymptotic behavior of $(\lambda_s,\varphi_s)$ as $s\uparrow +\infty$.</description>

      <title>An inductive approach to stochastic estimates for the $\varphi^{4}_2$-equation with correlated coefficient field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an inductive approach to obtaining stochastic estimates for the $\varphi^{4}_2$-equation when the coefficient field is correlated with the driving noise. Our method is based on (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian integration by parts with respect to Wick products of Gaussian random variables (more precisely, mollifications of space-time white noise)</description>

      <title>Gluing instantons \`a la Brezis-Coron in dimension four and the dipole construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a connection $A$ on a $SU(2)$-bundle $P$ over $\mathbb{R}^4$ with finite Yang-Mills energy $YM(A)$ and nonzero curvature $F_A(0)$ at the origin, and given $\rho&gt;0$ small enough, we construct a new connection $\hat A$ on a bundle $\hat P$ of different Chern class ($|c_2(A)-c_2(\hat A)|=8\pi^2$), in such a way that $\hat A$ is gauge equivalent to $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^4\setminus B_\rho(0)$, gauge equivalent to an instanton in a smaller ball $B_{\tau \rho}(0)$, and $$YM(\hat A)\le YM(A)+8\pi^2-\varepsilon_0\rho^4|F_A(0)|^2,$$ where $\tau\in (0.3,0.4)$ and $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$ are universal constant independent of $A$ and $\rho$. Our gluing method is similar in spirit to the one of Brezis-Coron for harmonic maps. We compare it with classical results by Taubes and discuss applications and open problems.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A transport approach to the cutoff phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</description>
