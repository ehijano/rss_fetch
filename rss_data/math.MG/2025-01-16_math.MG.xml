      <title>Is magnitude 'generically continuous' for finite metric spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces which, in the finite setting, can be understood as recording the 'effective number of points' in a space as the scale of the metric varies. Motivated by applications in topological data analysis, this paper investigates the stability of magnitude: its continuity properties with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We show that magnitude is nowhere continuous on the Gromov-Hausdorff space of finite metric spaces. Yet, we find evidence to suggest that it may be 'generically continuous', in the sense that generic Gromov-Hausdorff limits are preserved by magnitude. We make the case that, in fact, 'generic stability' is what matters for applicability.</description>

      <title>Expected extremal area of facets of random polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extremal properties of spherical random polytopes, the convex hull of random points chosen from the unit Euclidean sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The extremal properties of interest are the expected values of the maximum and minimum surface area among facets. We determine the asymptotic growth in every fixed dimension, up to absolute constants.</description>

      <title>Transportation cost spaces and stochastic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transportation cost spaces over finite metric spaces, also known as Lipschitz free spaces. Our work is motivated by a core problem posed by S. Dilworth, D. Kutzarova and M. Ostrovskii, namely, find a condition on a metric space $M$ equivalent to the Banach-Mazur distance between the transportation cost space over $M$ and $\ell_1^N$ of the corresponding dimension, which we call the $\ell_1^N$-distortion of $M$. In this regard, some examples have been studied like the $N\times N$ grid by Naor and Schechtman (2007) and the Laakso and diamond graphs by Dilworth, Kutzarova and Ostrovskii (2020), later studied by Baudier, Gartland and Schlumprecht (2023). We present here three main results. Firstly, we give a partial solution to this problem relating to the tree-like structure of the metric space. For that purpose, we develop a new technique that could potentially lead to a complete solution of the problem and utilize it to find an asymptotically tight upper bound of the $\ell_1^N$-distortion of the Laakso graphs, fully solving an open problem raised by Dilworth, Kutzarova and Ostrovskii. Finally, we apply our technique to prove that finite hyperbolic approximations of doubling metric spaces have uniformly bounded $\ell_1^N$-distortion.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: A Distributed Approach to Five Point Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work rigorously verifies the phase transition in 5-point energy minimization first observed by Melnyk-Knop-Smith in 1977. More precisely, we prove that there is a constant S = [15+24/512,15+25/512] such that the triangular bi-pyramid is the energy minimizer with respect to the s-power law potential for all s in (0,S) and some pyramid with square base is the unique minimizer for all s in (S,15+512/25]. Taking s=1 gives another solution to Thomson's 5 electron problem from 1904.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic sets of three types of convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00534v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sets of three types of convex pentagons that are aperiodic with no matching conditions on the edges are created from a chiral aperiodic monotile Tile(1, 1). This method divides the interior of Tile(1,1) into five convex polygons with five or more edges, and we have so far identified four methods.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic points for outer billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euclidean outer billiard on a regular polygon (that is not a triangle, square or a hexagon) has aperiodic points, i.e., points where all iterates of the outer billiard map are defined and yield pairwise distinct images. This result answers a question of R. Schwartz posed at ICM 2022.</description>

      <title>A variational perspective on the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the position and velocity of particles under the influence of external confinement, interaction, friction, and stochastic force. It is well-known that this equation can be formally seen as a dissipative Hamiltonian system in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In order to better understand this geometric formalism, we introduce a time-discrete variational scheme, solutions of which converge to the solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as time step vanishes; in particular, this provides a new proof of the existence of a weak solution to the equation. The variational scheme combines the symplectic Euler scheme and the (degenerate) implicit steepest descent, and updates the probability density at each iteration first in the velocity variable then in the position variable.
  The algorithm leverages the geometric structure of the equation, and has several desirable properties. Energy functionals involved in each variational problem are geodesically-convex, which implies the unique solvability of the problem. Furthermore, the correct dissipation of the Hamiltonian is observed at the discrete level up to higher order errors controlled by the second moments.</description>
