      <title>A third law of thermodynamics is an unnecessary complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof -- motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero -- overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic inference in very large universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for "first-person" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her "subjective state". We advocate a "Principle of Self-Locating Indifference" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of "old evidence".</description>

      <title>The Logical Structure of Physical Laws: A Fixed Point Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalise the self-referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set-theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as the least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and GR can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Particles -- Extended Structural Dynamics and the H Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extended structural dynamics framework that enriches classical mechanics by treating particle orientation and internal structure as fundamental phase-space coordinates. This extension preserves Hamiltonian structure and Liouville invariance while revealing two distinct mechanisms for entropy production: (i) collisional randomization through orientation-dependent scattering (generalizing Boltzmann), and (ii) continuous geometric instability arising from rotational-deformational coupling. We argue this dual-mechanism structure provides a dynamical justification for the molecular chaos assumption central to Boltzmann-Lanford derivations, particularly in regimes (dense systems, few bodies, structured particles) where classical point-particle theory fails. Recent mathematical advances (Deng, Hani &amp; Ma 2024) extend Lanford's theorem to arbitrary times but still require molecular chaos as input and apply only to dilute gases. This extended structural framework addresses the complementary philosophical question: how can molecular chaos itself emerge from deterministic dynamics? We show that geometric instability in extended phase space makes entropy-decreasing trajectories dynamically unstable, offering a structural explanation for the Second Law. This reframes thermodynamic irreversibility as a geometric property of structured motion rather than a purely statistical postulate.</description>
