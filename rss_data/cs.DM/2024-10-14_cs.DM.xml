      <title>Study on (r,s)- Generalised Transformation Graphs, A Novel Perspective Based on Transformation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $\mathbb{Q}=(\mathbb{V},\mathbb{E})$, the transformation graphs are defined as graphs with vertex set being $\mathbb{V(Q)} \cup \mathbb{E(Q)}$ and edge set is described following certain conditions. In comparison to the structure descriptor of the original graph $\mathbb{Q}$, the topological descriptor of its transformation graphs displays distinct characteristics related to structure. Thus, a compound's transformation graphs descriptors can be used to model a variety of structural features of the underlying chemical. In this work, the concept of transformation graphs are extended giving rise to novel class of graphs, the $(r,s)$- generalised transformation graphs, whose vertex set is union of $r$ copies of $\mathbb{V(Q)}$ and $s$ copies of $\mathbb{E(Q)}$, where, $r, s \in N$ and the edge set are defined under certain conditions. Further, these class of graphs are analysed with the help of first Zagreb index. Mainly, there are eight transformation graphs based on the criteria for edge set, but under the concept of $(r,s)$- generalised transformation graphs, infinite number of graphs can be described and analysed.</description>

      <title>Two-person positive shortest path games have Nash equlibria in pure stationary strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every finite two-person positive shortest path game has a Nash equilibrium (NE) in pure stationary strategies, which can be computed in polynomial time. The existence result holds also for graphs with finite out-degrees. Moreover, we prove that a terminal NE exists provided at least one of two players can guarantee reaching a terminal. If no one can do it, in other words, if each of two players can cut all terminals from the initial position $s$, then, obviously, a cyclic NE exists, although its cost is infinite for both players, since we restrict ourselves to positive games. We conjecture that a terminal NE exists too, provided there exists a directed path from $s$ to a terminal. However, this is open.</description>

      <title>Bounding $\varepsilon$-scatter dimension via metric sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work of Abbasi et al. [FOCS 2023] introduced the notion of $\varepsilon$-scatter dimension of a metric space and showed a general framework for efficient parameterized approximation schemes (so-called EPASes) for a wide range of clustering problems in classes of metric spaces that admit a bound on the $\varepsilon$-scatter dimension. Our main result is such a bound for metrics induced by graphs from any fixed proper minor-closed graph class. The bound is double-exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and the Hadwiger number of the graph class and is accompanied by a nearly tight lower bound that holds even in graph classes of bounded treewidth.
  On the way to the main result, we introduce metric analogs of well-known graph invariants from the theory of sparsity, including generalized coloring numbers and flatness (aka uniform quasi-wideness), and show bounds for these invariants in proper minor-closed graph classes.
  Finally, we show the power of newly introduced toolbox by showing a coreset for $k$-Center in any proper minor-closed graph class whose size is polynomial in $k$ (but the exponent of the polynomial depends on the graph class and $\varepsilon^{-1}$).</description>

      <title>The formula for the completion time of project networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formulates the completion time $\tau$ of a project network as $ \tau =\|\mathbf{R} \mathbf{t} \|_\infty $ where the rows of $\mathbf{R}$ are simple paths of the network and $\mathbf{t}$ is a column vector representing the duration of the activities. Considering this product as a linear transformation leads to interesting findings on the topological relevance of both paths and activities using singular value decomposition. The notion of spectral networks is introduced to condense the fundamental structure of the project network. A definition of project stress is introduced to establish a comparison index between two alternatives in terms of slack. Additionally, the Moore-Penrose inverse of $\mathbf{R}$ is presented to find the configuration of the durations of the activities resulting in a given simple path duration vector. Then, the systematic mapping review process carried out to assess our claims' novelty is reported. Finally, we reflect on the notion of relevance for paths and activities and the relationship of the incidence matrix with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Method to Generate Multi-interval Pairwise Compatibility Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between species is an important topic in the field of computational biology. Pairwise compatibility graphs (PCGs) are used to model such relationships. A graph is a PCG if its edges can be represented by the distance between the leaves of an edge-weighted tree within a fixed interval. If the number of intervals is more than one, then the graph with such a tree representation is called a multi-interval PCG. %($k$-IPCG). The aim of this paper is to generate all multi-interval PCGs with a given number of vertices. For this purpose, we propose a method to generate almost all multi-interval PCGs corresponding to a given tree by randomly assigning edge weights and selecting typical intervals. To reduce the exponential tree search space, we theoretically prove that for each multi-interval PCG there exists a tree whose internal vertices have degree exactly three, and developed an algorithm to enumerate such trees. The proposed method is applied to enumerate all two-interval PCGs with up to ten vertices. Our computational results establish that all graphs with up to ten vertices are 2-IPCGs, making significant progress towards the open problem of determining whether a non-2-IPCG exists with fewer than 135 vertices.</description>

      <title>Relative-error monotonicity testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of Boolean function property testing is not well suited for testing $\textit{sparse}$ functions which have few satisfying assignments, since every such function is close (in the usual Hamming distance metric) to the constant-0 function. In this work we propose and investigate a new model for property testing of Boolean functions, called $\textit{relative-error testing}$, which provides a natural framework for testing sparse functions.
  This new model defines the distance between two functions $f, g: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ to be $$\textsf{reldist}(f,g) := { \frac{|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|} {|f^{-1}(1)|}}.$$ This is a more demanding distance measure than the usual Hamming distance ${ {|f^{-1}(1) \triangle g^{-1}(1)|}/{2^n}}$ when $|f^{-1}(1)| \ll 2^n$; to compensate for this, algorithms in the new model have access both to a black-box oracle for the function $f$ being tested and to a source of independent uniform satisfying assignments of $f$.
  In this paper we first give a few general results about the relative-error testing model; then, as our main technical contribution, we give a detailed study of algorithms and lower bounds for relative-error testing of $\textit{monotone}$ Boolean functions. We give upper and lower bounds which are parameterized by $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$, the sparsity of the function $f$ being tested. Our results show that there are interesting differences between relative-error monotonicity testing of sparse Boolean functions, and monotonicity testing in the standard model. These results motivate further study of the testability of Boolean function properties in the relative-error model.</description>

      <title>Greediness is not always a vice: Efficient Discovery Algorithms for Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a maximum-weight matching is a classical and well-studied problem in computer science, solvable in cubic time in general graphs. We consider the specialization called assignment problem where the input is a bipartite graph, and introduce in this work the ``discovery'' variant considering edge weights that are not provided as input but must be queried, requiring additional and costly computations. We develop here discovery algorithms aiming to minimize the number of queried weights while providing guarantees on the computed solution. We first show in this work the inherent challenges of designing discovery algorithms for general assignment problems. We then provide and analyze several efficient greedy algorithms that can make use of natural assumptions about the order in which the nodes are processed by the algorithms. Our motivations for exploring this problem stem from finding practical solutions to a variation of maximum-weight matching in bipartite hypergraphs, a problem recently emerging in the formation of peer-to-peer energy sharing communities.</description>

      <title>Separable Drawings: Extendability and Crossing-Free Hamiltonian Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing pseudospherical drawings, we introduce a new class of simple drawings, which we call separable drawings. In a separable drawing, every edge can be closed to a simple curve that intersects each other edge at most once. Curves of different edges might interact arbitrarily. Most notably, we show that (1) every separable drawing of any graph on $n$ vertices in the plane can be extended to a simple drawing of the complete graph $K_{n}$, (2) every separable drawing of $K_{n}$ contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle and is plane Hamiltonian connected, and (3) every generalized convex drawing and every 2-page book drawing is separable. Further, the class of separable drawings is a proper superclass of the union of generalized convex and 2-page book drawings. Hence, our results on plane Hamiltonicity extend recent work on generalized convex drawings by Bergold et al. (SoCG 2024).</description>

      <title>Fast Reroute with Highly Connected Routes Based on Maximum Flow Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant routing allows the selection of alternative routes to the destination after the route being used fails. Fast Reroute (FRR) is a proactive strategy through which the protocol pre-configures backup routes that are activated when needed. In this work, we propose the MaxFlowRouting algorithm that employs maximum flow evaluation as well as the route size to select routes that are highly connected. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that if any component of such a route fails, there are more alternative paths to the destination in comparison with the route computed with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Simulation results are presented in which we compare the two algorithms (Dijkstra's and MaxFlowRouting) for multiple different random graphs (including Erdos-Renyi, Bar\'abasi-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz) and also for the topologies of some of the most important Internet backbones of the U.S.A., Europe, Brazil, and Japan: Internet2, Geant, RNP, and Wide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a basis $B$ for its cycle space, where each edge of $G$ belongs to at most $k$ members of $B$. In this note, we show that every non-planar graph that can be embedded on a surface with Euler characteristic $0$ has a basis number of exactly $3$, proving a conjecture of Schmeichel from 1981. Additionally, we show that any graph embedded on a surface $\Sigma$ (whether orientable or non-orientable) of genus $g$ has a basis number of $O(\log^2 g)$.</description>

      <title>Spaces of ranked tree-child networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranked tree-child networks are a recently introduced class of rooted phylogenetic networks in which the evolutionary events represented by the network are ordered so as to respect the flow of time. This class includes the well-studied ranked phylogenetic trees (also known as ranked genealogies). An important problem in phylogenetic analysis is to define distances between phylogenetic trees and networks in order to systematically compare them. Various distances have been defined on ranked binary phylogenetic trees, but very little is known about comparing ranked tree-child networks. In this paper, we introduce an approach to compare binary ranked tree-child networks on the same leaf set that is based on a new encoding of such networks that is given in terms of a certain partially ordered set. This allows us to define two new spaces of ranked binary tree-child networks. The first space can be considered as a generalization of the recently introduced space of ranked binary phylogenetic trees whose distance is defined in terms of ranked nearest neighbor interchange moves. The second space is a continuous space that captures all equidistant tree-child networks and generalizes the space of ultrametric trees. In particular, we show that this continuous space is a so-called CAT(0)-orthant space which, for example, implies that the distance between two equidistant tree-child networks can be efficiently computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1805.10330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a network that evolves according to a reversible, nearest neighbours dynamics. Is the dynamics allowed to vary the size of the network? On the one hand it seems that, being the principal carriers of information, nodes cannot be destroyed without jeopardising bijectivity. On the other hand, there are plenty of bijective functions from the set of graphs to the set of graphs that are non-vertex-preserving. The question has been settled negatively -- for three different reasons. Yet, in this paper we do obtain reversible local node creation/destruction -- in three relaxed settings, whose equivalence we prove for robustness. We motivate our work both by theoretical computer science considerations (reversible computing, cellular automata extensions) and theoretical physics concerns (basic formalisms towards discrete quantum gravity).</description>

Abstract: We study the recognition complexity of subgraphs of k-connected planar cubic graphs for k = 1, 2, 3. We present polynomial-time algorithms to recognize subgraphs of 1- and 2-connected planar cubic graphs, both in the variable and fixed embedding setting. The main tools involve the Generalized (Anti)factor-problem for the fixed embedding case, and SPQR-trees for the variable embedding case. Secondly, we prove NP-hardness of recognizing subgraphs of 3-connected planar cubic graphs in the variable embedding setting.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs via Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The treewidth is a structural parameter that measures the tree-likeness of a graph. Many algorithmic and combinatorial results are expressed in terms of the treewidth. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs that admit a straight-line drawing where all the vertices lie on a circle, and every edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges.
  Wood and Telle [New York J. Math., 2007] showed that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k + 11$ using so-called planar decompositions, and later, Auer et al. [Algorithmica, 2016] proved that the treewidth of outer $1$-planar graphs is at most $3$, which is tight.
  In this paper, we improve the general upper bound to $1.5k + 2$ and give a tight bound of $4$ for $k = 2$. We also establish a lower bound: we show that, for every even $k$, there is an outer $k$-planar graph with treewidth $k+2$. Our new bound immediately implies a better bound on the cop number, which answers an open question of Durocher et al. [GD 2023] in the affirmative.
  Our treewidth bound relies on a new and simple triangulation method for outer $k$-planar graphs that yields few crossings with graph edges per edge of the triangulation. Our method also enables us to obtain a tight upper bound of $k + 2$ for the separation number of outer $k$-planar graphs, improving an upper bound of $2k + 3$ by Chaplick et al. [GD 2017]. We also consider outer min-$k$-planar graphs, a generalization of outer $k$-planar graphs, where we achieve smaller improvements.</description>

      <title>A scalable clustering algorithm to approximate graph cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their computational complexity, graph cuts for cluster detection and identification are used mostly in the form of convex relaxations. We propose to utilize the original graph cuts such as Ratio, Normalized or Cheeger Cut to detect clusters in weighted undirected graphs by restricting the graph cut minimization to $st$-MinCut partitions. Incorporating a vertex selection technique and restricting optimization to tightly connected clusters, we combine the efficient computability of $st$-MinCuts and the intrinsic properties of Gomory-Hu trees with the cut quality of the original graph cuts, leading to linear runtime in the number of vertices and quadratic in the number of edges. Already in simple scenarios, the resulting algorithm Xist is able to approximate graph cut values better empirically than spectral clustering or comparable algorithms, even for large network datasets. We showcase its applicability by segmenting images from cell biology and provide empirical studies of runtime and classification rate.</description>

      <title>Pathway Realisability in Chemical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of pathways and alternative pathways that have a specific function is of interest in numerous chemical contexts. A framework for specifying and searching for pathways has previously been developed, but a focus on which of the many pathway solutions are realisable, or can be made realisable, is missing. Realisable here means that there actually exists some sequencing of the reactions of the pathway that will execute the pathway. We present a method for analysing the realisability of pathways based on the reachability question in Petri nets. For realisable pathways, our method also provides a certificate encoding an order of the reactions which realises the pathway. We present two extended notions of realisability of pathways, one of which is related to the concept of network catalysts. We exemplify our findings on the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of our concepts for elucidating the choices often implicitly made when depicting pathways. Lastly, we lay the foundation for the mathematical theory of realisability.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book collects the lectures about graph theory and its applications which were given to students of mathematical departments of Moscow State University and Peking University. Graph theory is a very wide field with a lot of applications in almost every scientific area: in many branches of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and also in psychology, arts, philosophy and many others. Nowadays, graph theory becomes especially more important because of the rapid development of molecular biology, neural networks and AI fields. One of the aims of writing this book was to give students thorough knowledge about graphs to understand modern scientific fields more deeply. Here we tried to give classical and modern theorems and algorithms in more understandable and simple way. We spent many time to rewrite them and close the gaps in several simplest well-known proofs to provide more precise and accurate material for students.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a new quantum PageRank algorithm on graphs using discrete-time open quantum walks. Google's PageRank is an essential algorithm for arranging the web pages on the World Wide Web in classical computation. From a broader perspective, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also serves to quantify the significance of a network's vertices. In this work, we extend the concept of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by utilizing the Weyl operators as Kraus operators. This new model of quantum walk is useful for building up the quantum PageRank algorithm, discussed in this article. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, GNC, GN, GNR networks, Barab\'asi and Albert network, etc. In addition, we study the convergence of the quantum PageRank process and its dependency on the damping factor $\alpha$. We observe that this quantum pagerank procedure is faster than many other proposals reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and native (real-world) RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive base pairs frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in native RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in native secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of the cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 1,2,4,6$. For non-cyclic finite nilpotent groups, we show that the oriented diameter of corresponding power graphs is at least $3$. Moreover, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the oriented diameter of $2$-edge connected power graphs of finite non-cyclic nilpotent groups to be either $3$ or $4$. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>
