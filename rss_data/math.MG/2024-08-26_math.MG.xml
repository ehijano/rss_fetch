      <title>A tour d'horizon of de Casteljau's work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst Paul de Casteljau is now famous for his fundamental algorithm of curve and surface approximation, little is known about his other findings. This article offers an insight into his results in geometry, algebra and number theory.
  Related to geometry, his classical algorithm is reviewed as an index reduction of a polar form. This idea is used to show de Casteljau's algebraic way of smoothing, which long went unnoticed. We will also see an analytic polar form and its use in finding the intersection of two curves. The article summarises unpublished material on metric geometry. It includes theoretical advances, e.g., the 14-point strophoid or a way to link Apollonian circles with confocal conics, and also practical applications such as a recurrence for conjugate mirrors in geometric optics. A view on regular polygons leads to an approximation of their diagonals by golden matrices, a generalisation of the golden ratio.
  Relevant algebraic findings include matrix quaternions (and anti-quaternions) and their link with Lorentz' equations. De Casteljau generalised the Euclidean algorithm and developed an automated method for approximating the roots of a class of polynomial equations. His contributions to number theory not only include aspects on the sum of four squares as in quaternions, but also a view on a particular sum of three cubes. After a review of a complete quadrilateral in a heptagon and its angles, the paper concludes with a summary of de Casteljau's key achievements.
  The article contains a comprehensive bibliography of de Casteljau's works, including previously unpublished material.</description>

      <title>Glued spaces and lower curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we survey theorems and provide conjectures on gluing constructions under lower curvature bounds in smooth and non-smooth context. Focusing on synthetic lower Ricci curvature bounds we consider Riemannian manifolds, weighted Riemannian manifolds, Alexandrov spaces, collapsed and non-collapsed $RCD$ spaces, and sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <title>A step towards the tensorization of Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Sobolev spaces on Cartesian and warped products of metric spaces tensorize, only requiring that one of the factors is a doubling space supporting a Poincar'e inequality.</description>

      <title>On the edge densities of convex mosaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of finding the minimum of edge density in families of convex mosaics with unit volume cells in $3$-dimensional Euclidean space. We solve this problem for two families. In particular, we prove that a translative convex mosaic with unit volume cells has minimal edge density if it is a face-to-face mosaic generated by unit cubes. We also investigate decomposable mosaics, defined as mosaics whose cells are Minkowski sums of cells of two lower dimensional convex mosaics, and show that the edge density of every normal decomposable mosaic with unit volume cells is at least as large as that of a face-to-face mosaic with regular triangle-based right prisms as cells.</description>
