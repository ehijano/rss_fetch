      <title>Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03612v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Option Pricing with an Extended Black-Scholes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates enhancing option pricing by extending the Black-Scholes model to include stochastic volatility and interest rate variability within the Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling.</description>
