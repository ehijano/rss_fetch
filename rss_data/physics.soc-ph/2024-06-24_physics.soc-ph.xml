      <title>Assortativity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree-degree correlation is crucial in understanding the structural properties of and dynamics occurring upon network, and is often measured by the assortativity coefficient $r$. In this paper, we first study this measure in detail and conclude that $r$ belongs to an asymmetric range $[-1,1)$ rather than the widely-cited $[-1,1]$. Among which, we verify that star is the unique tree network that achieves the lower bound of index $r$. Next, we obtain that all the resultant networks based on several widely-used kinds of edge-based iterative operations are disassortative if seed model has negative $r$, and also generate a family of growing neutral networks. Then, we propose an edge-based iterative operation to construct growing assortative network when seed is assortative, and further extend it to work well in general setting. Lastly, we establish a sufficient condition for existence of neutral tree network, accordingly, not only find out a representative of any order neutral tree network for the first time, but also are the first to create growing neutral tree networks as well. Also, we obtain $8n/9$ neutral non-tree graphs of distinct order as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous peer effects of college roommates on academic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how student peers influence learning outcomes is crucial for effective education management in complex social systems. The complexities of peer selection and evolving peer relationships, however, pose challenges for identifying peer effects using static observational data. Here we use both null-model and regression approaches to examine peer effects using longitudinal data from 5,272 undergraduates, where roommate assignments are plausibly random upon enrollment and roommate relationships persist until graduation. Specifically, we construct a roommate null model by randomly shuffling students among dorm rooms and introduce an assimilation metric to quantify similarities in roommate academic performance. We find significantly larger assimilation in actual data than in the roommate null model, suggesting roommate peer effects, whereby roommates have more similar performance than expected by chance alone. Moreover, assimilation exhibits an overall increasing trend over time, suggesting that peer effects become stronger the longer roommates live together. Our regression analysis further reveals the moderating role of peer heterogeneity. In particular, when roommates perform similarly, the positive relationship between a student's future performance and their roommates' average prior performance is more pronounced, and their ordinal rank in the dorm room has an independent effect. Our findings contribute to understanding the role of college roommates in influencing student academic performance.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In well-mixed populations, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, we are still lacking a general understanding of how epidemics spread when individual interactions form a complex network. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, aside from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>A-TEAM: Advanced Traffic Event Analysis and Management Platform for Transportation Data-Driven Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth in terms of the availability of transportation data provides great potential for the introduction of emerging data-driven methodologies into transportation-related research and development efforts. However, advanced data-driven models, such as artificial-intelligence based approaches, usually contain complicated modeling structures and require strict data formats along with a very complex execution environment. It is thus often challenging to deploy and implement such data-driven models in a real-world environment. Moreover, a full-fledged application requires not only well developed and calibrated models, but also efficient connections with back end infrastructure such as large databases and front end utilities, such as a user-interface. This paper introduces a novel platform which provides an integrated architecture for deploying multi-purpose real-time traffic management applications. Inspired by the concept of modular design in software system development, this paper proposes a modular platform allowing users to customize their mission specific needs and preferences. The developed platform is capable of incorporating flexible user-provided models and/or data with the ultimate goal of deploying them as a complete application ready for real-world use. To illustrate this novel modular software system concept, this paper presents a work zone management and coordination application that is built upon the developed implementation platform to provide useful decision support to traffic engineers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Monetarism: influence of Entropic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to gas-like models, from the concept of entropy, using the money stock data of two economic agents, in this case of two countries, which carry out market actions (trading) in two theoretical scenarios: in the absence of debt and with debt. The exercise deals exclusively with a no debt scenario and the data and results show that the bounded model generates low $P_{(m)}$, values that the results of the regressions between the two countries show an advantageous position of the stock country $m_i$ over the stock country $m_j$. About the rationale, it is found that these models can provide meaningful information regarding the behavior of monetary variables, -- taking into account the different conceptual positions proposed in the manuscript -- using analogies derived from other fields of study ranging from molecules in rarefied gases or particles collisions, bringing the data to the interaction of economic actors.</description>

      <title>Determination of the mean center of a region: A physics-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean center of a geographical region, including continents and countries, has been mostly determined to study the trend of population migration, the shift of economic hubs, and the spatial change of extreme climate events. However, the determination of the mean center is a formidable task as it deals with the curvature of the earth's surface. Here, we report a physics-based model to determine the mean center of a region. Our method provides the analytical expression for the location of the mean center for both flat and curved spaces, such as straight lines, circles, planes, three-dimensional space, cylinders, and spheres. Some of these expressions are often used to compute the center of mass of the physical system. Therefore, the implication of our model in the physical system extends the general validity of the model. Furthermore, we have computed various mean centers of India, such as the geographical, population, and crime centers. We have also assessed the year-wise movement of the crime center and found a spatial trend towards the north.</description>

      <title>Emergent Complexity in the Decision-Making Process of Chess Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the decision-making process of chess players by using a chess engine to evaluate the moves across different pools of games. We quantify the decisiveness of each move during the games using a metric called $\Delta$, which is derived from the engine's evaluation of the positions. We then performed a comparative analysis across players of varying competitive levels. Firstly, we observed that players face a wide spectrum of $\Delta$ values, evidencing the complexity of the process. By examining groups of winning and losing players, we found evidence where a decrease in complexity may be associated with a drop in player performance levels. Secondly, we observed that players' accuracy increases in positions with high $\Delta$ values regardless of competitive level. Complementing this information with a null model where players make completely random legal moves allowed us to characterize the decision-making process under the simple strategy of making moves that minimize $\Delta$ values. Finally, based on this idea, we proposed a simple model that approximately replicates the global emergent properties of the system.</description>

      <title>How Does Culture Evolve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter synthesizes evidence from cognitive science, evolutionary theory, anthropology, psychological studies, and computational models for a complex systems inspired theory of creativity, and its role in cultural evolution. Creativity is guided by the global shape of one's integrated network of memories, concepts, and beliefs: one's worldview. This integrated structure and its dynamical change over time are described using autocatalytic networks. Autocatalytic networks can interact with each other, and they can grow and evolve; through interactions between their components, they generate novel components. Thus, they are used to describe cultural change both within and between individuals, as well as across cultural lineages. The chapter outlines autocatalytic network models of the origin of culture, the cognitive developmental process by which each child becomes a participant in cultural evolution, and the role of imitation, leadership, and social media on cultural evolution, as well as the trade-off between creativity and continuity.</description>

      <title>On the Principles behind Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of opinions inside a population of interacting large language models (LLMs). Every LLM needs to decide how much funding to allocate to an item with three initial possibilities: full, partial, or no funding. We identify biases that drive the exchange of opinions based on the LLM's tendency to (i) find consensus with the other LLM's opinion, (ii) display caution when specifying funding, and (iii) consider ethical concerns in its opinion. We find these biases are affected by the perceived absence of compelling reasons for opinion change, the perceived willingness to engage in discussion, and the distribution of allocation values. Moreover, tensions among biases can lead to the survival of funding for items with negative connotations. We also find that the final distribution of full, partial, and no funding opinions is more diverse when an LLM freely forms its opinion after an interaction than when its opinion is a multiple-choice selection among the three allocation options. In the latter case, consensus or polarization is generally attained. When agents are aware of past opinions, they seek to maintain consistency with them, and more diverse updating rules emerge. Our study is performed using a Llama 3 LLM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigated roles of institutional types and ethnic/racial background on academic credit among the traditionally underrepresented population of the U.S. study abroad program. Using archival data, the study sampled the students' enrollment and academic credit information spanning a period of 20 years (2003 - 2022). Data analysis Using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicates significant main influence of institutional type (p&lt;.001) and significant main influence of ethnic/racial identity (p&lt;.001) on students' academic credit. The result was discussed in terms of its relevance in educational policy re-evaluations, improvement of the study conditions of the underrepresented students, and enhancement of the enrollment opportunities of these minority population across all U.S. institutions of learning</description>

      <title>On the number of freeway lanes and its positive or negative effect on safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the 80-year-old question of whether a freeway with more lanes results in fewer or more accidents. For finding the optimally safe number of lanes, in particular, we look at three types of accidents that are prevalent on urban freeways, namely "following too closely", "driver inattention", and "unsafe change of lanes". To do so we extend the intelligent driver model (IDM) to create a microscopic traffic flow model which is capable of producing accidents. We study the rate of accidents relative to a baseline 2-lane unidirectional freeway via Monte Carlo simulation. For each simulation instance we create a starting configuration involving only a few cars over a short segment of the freeway and simulate the dynamics thereafter. Furthermore, we look at the number of shoulders present, and show that the presence of shoulders can positively or negatively affect the accident rate depending on the type of accident.</description>

      <title>How big does a population need to be before demographers can ignore individual-level randomness in demographic events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying a national-level population, demographers can safely ignore the effect of individual-level randomness on age-sex structure. When studying a single community, or group of communities, however, the potential importance of individual-level randomness is less clear. We seek to measure the effect of individual-level randomness in births and deaths on standard summary indicators of age-sex structure, for populations of different sizes, focusing on on demographic conditions typical of historical populations. We conduct a microsimulation experiment where we simulate events and age-sex structure under a range of settings for demographic rates and population size. The experiment results suggest that individual-level randomness strongly affects age-sex structure for populations of about 100, but has a much smaller effect on populations of 1,000, and a negligible effect on populations of 10,000. Our conclusion is that analyses of age-sex structure in historical populations with sizes on the order 100 must account for individual-level randomness in demographic events. Analyses of populations with sizes on the order of 1,000 may need to make some allowance for individual-level variation, but other issues, such as measurement error, probably deserve more attention. Analyses of populations of 10,000 can safely ignore individual-level variation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>

      <title>Food Pairing Unveiled: Exploring Recipe Creation Dynamics through Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 2000s, renowned chef Heston Blumenthal formulated his "food pairing" hypothesis, positing that if foods share many flavor compounds, then they tend to taste good when eaten together. In 2011, Ahn et al. conducted a study using a dataset of recipes, ingredients, and flavor compounds, finding that, in Western cuisine, ingredients in recipes often share more flavor compounds than expected by chance, indicating a natural tendency towards food pairing. Building upon Ahn's research, our work applies state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques to the dataset, providing a tool that can recommend new foods to add in recipes, retrieve missing ingredients and advise against certain combinations. We create our recommender in two ways, by taking into account ingredients appearances in recipes or shared flavor compounds between foods. While our analysis confirms the existence of food pairing, the recipe-based recommender performs significantly better than the flavor-based one, leading to the conclusion that food pairing is just one of the principles to take into account when creating recipes. Furthermore, and more interestingly, we find that food pairing in data is mostly due to trivial couplings of very similar ingredients, leading to a reconsideration of its current role in recipes, from being an already existing feature to a key to open up new scenarios in gastronomy. Our flavor-based recommender can thus leverage this novel concept and provide a new tool to lead culinary innovation.</description>

      <title>The impact of fear and behaviour response to established and novel diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a disease transmission model that allows individuals to acquire fear and change their behaviour to reduce transmission. Fear is acquired through contact with infected individuals and through the influence of fearful individuals. We analyze the model in two limits: First, an Established Disease Limit (EDL), where the spread of the disease is much faster than the spread of fear, and second, a Novel Disease Limit (NDL), where the spread of the disease is comparable to that of fear. For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behaviour has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behaviour depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behaviour introduces a contact parameter $p$, which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic. We analytically identify a critical prophylactic behaviour parameter $p=p_c$ where this happens leading to a discontinuity in epidemic prevalence. We show that this change in disease burden introduces multiple epidemic waves.</description>

      <title>Triple Helix synergy and patent dynamics. Cross country compartison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a computationally efficient technique of Logistic Continuous Wavelet transform (CWT) to analyze patent data for Switzerland, Germany, USA, and Brszil for the period 1980-2000. We found that patent growth dynamics follows the dynamics of innovation system synergy in the framework of Triple Helix model of innovations where observed non-linear actors' interactions are provided by biased information exchange between heterogenious actors. Suggested approach reveals the latent trend structure in patent and innovation dynamics and may help policymakers identify the potential drivers of patent and innovation activity and form informed policy for boosting innovation development. The paper also privides a foundation for future research in differnt fields studying complex systems of interacting heterogenious agents.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Optimization Approaches for the Network Immunization Problem with Quarantining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination has played an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. However, the limited availability of vaccines and personnel at the roll-out of a new vaccine, as well as the costs of vaccination campaigns, might limit how many people can be vaccinated. Network immunization thus focuses on selecting a fixed-size subset of individuals to vaccinate so as to minimize the disease spread. In this paper, we consider simulation-optimization approaches for this selection problem. Here, the simulation of disease spread in an activity-based contact graph allows us to consider the effect of contact tracing and a limited willingness to test and quarantine. First, we develop a stochastic programming algorithm based on sampling infection forests from the simulation. Second, we propose a genetic algorithm that is tailored to the immunization problem and combines simulation runs of different sizes to balance the time needed to find promising solutions with the uncertainty resulting from simulation. Both approaches are tested on data from a major university in Denmark and disease characteristics representing those of COVID-19. Our results show that the proposed methods are competitive with a large number of centrality-based measures over a range of disease parameters and that the proposed methods are able to outperform them for a considerable number of these instances. Finally, we compare network immunization against our previously proposed approach of limiting distinct contacts. Although, independently, network immunization has a larger impact in reducing disease spread, we show that the combination of both methods reduces the disease spread even further.</description>

      <title>Persuasion, Betrayal and Regret in Election Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elections play a fundamental role in democratic societies, however they are often characterized by unexpected results. Here we discuss an election campaign model inspired by the compartmental epidemiology, and we show that the model captures the main characteristics of an election campaign: persuasion, betrayal and regret. All of these three factors can be used together or independently to influence the campaign, and to determine the winner. We include results for both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the model, and we show that the decision to not vote significantly increases the fluctuations in the model, amplifying the chance of controversial results, in agreement with the well known "paradox of not voting".</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven decision-making dynamics sheds light on the emergence of the "paradox of choice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action among multiple alternatives. As the decision maker belongs to a complex microenvironment (which contains multiple decision makers), has to make a decision where multiple options are present which often leads to a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choices". The latter refers to the case where too many options can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased uncertainty, decision paralysis, and frustration. Here, we employ an entropy driven mechanism within a statistical physics framework to explain the premises of the paradox. In turn, we focus on the emergence of a collective "paradox of choice", in the case of interacting decision-making agents, quantified as the decision synchronization time. Our findings reveal a trade-off between synchronization time and the sensing radius, indicating the optimal conditions for information transfer among group members, which significantly depends the individual sensitivity parameters. Interestingly, when agents sense their microenvironment in a biased way or their decisions are influenced by their past choices, then the collective "paradox of choice" does not occur. In a nutshell, our theory offers a low-dimensional and unified statistical explanation of the "paradox of choice" at the individual and at the collective level.</description>

      <title>Philosophical views of justice and their implications in energy systems modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What constitutes socially just or unjust energy systems or transitions can be derived from the philosophy and theories of justice. Assessments of justice and utilising them in modelling lead to great differences based on which justice principles are applied. We find that comparisons between the two principles of utilitarianism and egalitarianism dominate in assessments of distributive justice, with the latter most often considered representing a "just energy system". The lack of recognition of alternative and equally valid principles of justice, resting on e.g. capabilities, responsibilities and/or opportunities, leads to a narrow understanding of justice that fails to align with the views of different individuals, stakeholders and societies. More importantly, it can lead to the unjust design of future energy systems and energy systems analysis. In this work, we contribute to the growing amount of research on justice in energy systems modelling by assessing the implications of different philosophical views on justice on modelling results. Through a modelling exercise with a power system model for Europe, we explore different designs of a future net-zero European energy system, and its distributional implications based on the application of different justice principles. In addition to the utilitarian and egalitarian approach, we include, among others, principles of "polluters pay" and "ability-to-pay", which take historical contributions of GHG and the socio-economic conditions of a region into account. We find that socially just energy systems look significantly different depending on the justice principles applied. The results may stimulate a greater discussion among researchers and policymakers on the implications of different constructions of justice in modelling, expansion of approaches, and demonstrate the importance of transparency and assumptions when communicating such results</description>

      <title>Adaptive Payoff-driven Interaction in Networked Snowdrift Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social dilemmas, most interactions are transient and susceptible to restructuring, leading to continuous changes in social networks over time. Typically, agents assess the rewards of their current interactions and adjust their connections to optimize outcomes. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive network model in the snowdrift game to examine dynamic levels of cooperation and network topology, involving the potential for both the termination of existing connections and the establishment of new ones. In particular, we define the agent's asymmetric disassociation tendency toward their neighbors, which fundamentally determines the probability of edge dismantlement. The mechanism allows agents to selectively sever and rewire their connections to alternative individuals to refine partnerships. Our findings reveal that adaptive networks are particularly effective in promoting a robust evolution toward states of either pure cooperation or complete defection, especially under conditions of extreme cost-benefit ratios, as compared to static network models. Moreover, the dynamic restructuring of connections and the distribution of network degrees among agents are closely linked to the levels of cooperation in stationary states. Specifically, cooperators tend to seek broader neighborhoods when confronted with the invasion of multiple defectors.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's paradox in susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics over periodic temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many social and biological networks periodically change over time with daily, weekly, and other cycles. Thus motivated, we formulate and analyze susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic models over temporal networks with periodic schedules. More specifically, we assume that the temporal network consists of a cycle of alternately used static networks, each with a given duration. We show Parrondo's paradox behavior in this model, with which the periodic alternation of two static networks that are supra-threshold (i.e., above the epidemic threshold of the SIS model) yields a sub-threshold dynamics (i.e., with the number of infectious nodes exponentially decaying over time) in many cases. We find community structure to play an important role in shaping this phenomenon, and we study its dependence on the connectivity between and number of communities. Our findings associate such paradoxical behavior with anti-phase oscillatory behavior of the number of infectious nodes in different communities of the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between topology and dynamics of complex systems has motivated continuing interest from the scientific community. In the present work, we address this interesting topic from the perspective of simple games, involving two teams playing according to a small set of simple rules, taking place on four types of complex networks. Starting from a minimalist game, characterized by full symmetry always leading to ties, four other games are described in progressive order of complexity, taking into account the presence of neighbors as well as strategies. Each of these five games, as well as their specific changes when implemented in four types of networks, are studied in terms of statistics of the total duration of the game as well as the number of victories and ties, with several interesting results that substantiate, in some cases, the importance of the network topology on the respective dynamics. As a subsidiary result, the visualization of relationships between the data elements in terms of coincidence similarity networks allowed a more complete and direct interpretation of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>The Persistence of Contrarianism on Twitter: Mapping users' sharing habits for the Ukraine war, COVID-19 vaccination, and the 2020 Midterm Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies of online disinformation emphasize matters of public concern such as the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and the Russo-Ukraine war, largely in studies that treat the topics separately. Comparatively fewer studies attempt to relate such disparate topics and address the extent to which they share behaviors. In this study, we compare three samples of Twitter data on COVID-19 vaccination, the Ukraine war and the 2020 midterm elections, to ascertain how distinct ideological stances of users across the three samples might be related. Our results indicate the emergence of a broad contrarian stance that is defined by its opposition to public health narratives/policies along with the Biden administration's foreign policy stances. Sharing activity within the contrarian position falls on a spectrum with outright conspiratorial content on one end. We confirm the existence of ideologically coherent cross-subject stances among Twitter users, but in a manner not squarely aligned with right-left political orientations.</description>

      <title>GNNTAL:A Novel Model for Identifying Critical Nodes in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of critical nodes is a prominent topic in the study of complex networks. Numerous methods have been proposed, yet most exhibit inherent limitations. Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.</description>

Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers study mathematical models of opinions to explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote accurate information and reduce unwanted influence. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model that looks at opinion changes from social interactions. We briefly describe what opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <title>Generalized Naming Game and Bayesian Naming Game as Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\beta$-model ($\beta$-NG) and the Bayesian Naming Game (BNG) as dynamical systems. By applying linear stability analysis to the dynamical system associated with the $\beta$-model, we demonstrate the existence of a non-generic bifurcation with a bifurcation point $\beta_c = 1/3$. As $\beta$ passes through $\beta_c$, the stability of isolated fixed points changes, giving rise to a one-dimensional manifold of fixed points. Notably, this attracting invariant manifold forms an arc of an ellipse. In the context of the BNG, we propose modeling the Bayesian learning probabilities $p_A$ and $p_B$ as logistic functions. This modeling approach allows us to establish the existence of fixed points without relying on the overly strong assumption that $p_A = p_B = p$, where $p$ is a constant.</description>

      <title>DeepTrace: Learning to Optimize Contact Tracing in Epidemic Networks with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital contact tracing aims to curb epidemics by identifying and mitigating public health emergencies through technology. Backward contact tracing, which tracks the sources of infection, proved crucial in places like Japan for identifying COVID-19 infections from superspreading events. This paper presents a novel perspective of digital contact tracing as online graph exploration and addresses the forward and backward contact tracing problem as a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation problem using iterative epidemic network data sampling. The challenge lies in the combinatorial complexity and rapid spread of infections. We introduce DeepTrace, an algorithm based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that iteratively updates its estimations as new contact tracing data is collected, learning to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation by utilizing topological features to accelerate learning and improve convergence. The contact tracing process combines either BFS or DFS to expand the network and trace the infection source, ensuring comprehensive and efficient exploration. Additionally, the GNN model is fine-tuned through a two-phase approach: pre-training with synthetic networks to approximate likelihood probabilities and fine-tuning with high-quality data to refine the model. Using COVID-19 variant data, we illustrate that DeepTrace surpasses current methods in identifying superspreaders, providing a robust basis for a scalable digital contact tracing strategy.</description>

      <title>Open Models, Closed Minds? On Agents Capabilities in Mimicking Human Personalities through Open Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities exhibited by LLMs and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by employing a set of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and \textit{higher-order} interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through new decomposition strategies. To illustrate how this works in practice, we derive a new decomposition of the KL-divergence, and show that it correctly disentangles divergences at different orders on simulated spin models. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>
