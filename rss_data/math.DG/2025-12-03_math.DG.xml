      <title>Holomorphic linking numbers, ABC Massey products, and Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On compact K\"ahler manifolds, we relate ABC Massey products arising from complex analytic cycles to holomorphic linking numbers. This enables us to construct a family of simply connected projective 3-folds with trivial canonical bundle, equipped with a non-vanishing ABC Massey product.</description>

      <title>The Liouville theorem on H-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a Liouville type theorem to the semilinear subcritical elliptic equation on H-type groups. The semilinear subcritical elliptic equation studied in this paper is a generalization of a classical semilinear subcritical elliptic equation on the Heisenberg group. The proofs are based on an {\it a priori} integral estimate and a generalized differential identity which found by Jerison and Lee [J. Diff. Geom, 29 (1989)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the twisted Calabi functional and the associated twisted Calabi flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Our main contributions are threefold: first, we establish the convexity of the twisted Calabi functional at its critical points; second, we prove the short-time existence of the twisted Calabi flow; and third, we demonstrate the stability of this flow in the neighborhood of twisted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. These results provide an analytic foundation for studying the twisted Calabi flow and resolve questions about its local behavior.</description>

      <title>Self-Expanding Solutions to the Mean Curvature Flow for Multiphase Surfaces with Regular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multiphase surface $\mathcal{C}_0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of a finite number of surfaces passing through the origin , where all 1-dimensional junctions are regular triple junctions in which three planes meet at the same angle and each surface scales down homothetically to a limit curve of finite length. We prove the existence of self-similar expanding solutions of the mean curvature flow on the multiphase surface initially given by $\mathcal{C}_0$. For this initial condition, there are multiple solutions that are combinations of the regular triple junctions and regular quadruple points, where four regular triple junctions meet at an angle of approximately $109.5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Obstructions of deforming complex structures and cohomology contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kodaira principle asserts that suitable cohomological contraction maps annihilate obstructions to deforming complex structures. In this paper, we revisit these phenomena from a purely analytic point of view, developing a refined power series method for the deformation of $(p,q)$-forms and complex structures. Working with the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence, we show that under natural partial vanishing conditions on its differentials, all obstruction classes lie in the kernel of the corresponding contraction maps. This yields a refined Kodaira principle that recovers and strictly extends the known results. As a main application, we obtain new unobstructedness criteria for compact complex manifolds with trivial canonical bundle.</description>

      <title>Swarming by curvature control in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system proposed in the literature to model fish behavior. In this model, the agents move at constant speed and control the curvature of their trajectory (i.e. the time-derivative of their velocity) so as to align their velocity with that of their neighbors, up to some noise. We provide a novel $n$-dimensional formulation of this model for any $n \geq 3$ and derive its mean-field kinetic formulation using bundle geometry concepts. The target of the paper is the derivation of a fluid model in the hydrodynamic limit. We show that this fluid model is the "self-organized hydrodynamic" (SOH) model already found in earlier work pertaining to the Vicsek model. The derivation is based on the introduction of appropriate "generalized collision invariants" (GCI). The action of the $n$-dimensional orthogonal group is used to reduce the expression of the GCI to a set of two functions satisfying a system of equations which is solved by means of a variational formulation. This leads to explicit formulas for the coefficients of the SOH model in terms of those of the original interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parallel transport on the Wasserstein space and equivariant diffusions on the group of diffeomorphisms over a closed Riemannian manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of solutions to stochastic differential equations on the Wasserstein space over a closed Riemannian manifold, under suitable regularity assumptions on the driving vector fields. Interpreting the diffeomorphism group $\mathscr{D}$ as a Riemannian submersion onto the smooth Wasserstein space $\P_\infty$, we further prove the existence and uniqueness of the stochastic parallel parallel transport along diffusions on $\P_\infty$. Finally, we show that equivariant diffusions on $\mathscr{D}$ endowed with a principal bundle structure over $\P_\infty$ admit a unique factorization into a horizontal diffusion and a vertical component expressed as a right exponential of a process taking values in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of the group $G$ of volume preserving diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Stability of knot equivalence at low regularity, and symmetric critical knots for the M\"obius energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present sufficient criteria for the equivalence of tame knots at low regularity. To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.
  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.
  As an application we show that the M\"obius energy introduced by O'Hara~\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the M\"obius energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain upper bounds on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for closed hyperbolic surfaces in terms of the number of short closed geodesics and the genus $g$. For example, we show that if the number of short closed geodesics is sublinear in $g$, then the multiplicity of the first eigenvalue is also sublinear in $g$. This makes new progress on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi\`ere in the mid 1980s.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the weak inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish a local gradient estimate for anisotropic $p$-harmonic functions. A key feature of our estimate is that the constant remains bounded as $p\to 1$; consequently, in the limit $p\to 1$, this estimate yields the local gradient estimate for weak solutions of the inverse anisotropic mean curvature flow (IAMCF). As an application, we show that the weak IAMCF is asymptotic to the expanding Wulff shape solution at the infinity, thereby extending the result of Huisken and Ilmanen in [8] to the anisotropic case.</description>

      <title>Winding and focussing for geodesics passing a thin cuspidal neck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study geodesics on a family $(M_\varepsilon)$ of manifolds that have a thin neck, which degenerate to a space with an incomplete cuspidal singularity as $\varepsilon\to0$. There are essentially two classes of geodesics passing the waist, i.e. the cross section where the neck is thinnest: 1. Those hitting the waist almost vertically. We find that these exhibit a surprising focussing phenomenon as $\varepsilon\to0$: certain exit directions will be preferred, for a generic limiting singularity. 2. Those hitting the waist obliquely at a uniformly non-vertical angle. They wind around the neck more and more as $\varepsilon\to0$. We give a precise quantitative description of this winding. We illustrate both phenomena by numerical solutions. Our results rest on a detailed analysis at the two relevant scales: the points whose distance to the waist is of order $\varepsilon$, and those much farther away. This multiscale analysis is efficiently expressed in terms of blow-up.</description>

      <title>Minimal Degrees, Volume Growth, and Curvature Decay on Complete K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider noncompact complete K\"ahler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature. Our main results are: 1. Precise relations among refined minimal degree of polynomial growth holomorphic functions and holomorphic volume forms, $\operatorname{AVR}$ (asymptotic volume ratio) and $\operatorname{ASCD}$ (average of scalar curvature decay) are established. 2. The Lyapunov asymptotic behavior of the K\"ahler-Ricci flow can be described in terms of polynomial growth holomorphic functions. This provides a unifying perspective that bridges the two distinct proofs of Yau's uniformization conjecture by Liu and Chau-Lee-Tam. These resolve two conjectures made by Yang. 3. The link of any tangent cone is homeomorphic to a sphere, providing a K\"ahler analogue of a result of Kapovitch in the Riemannian case.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the Bonnet problem in Thurston geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bonnet problem in Bianchi--Cartan--Vr\u{a}nceanu spaces and in $\mathrm{Sol}_3$. Our main contribution is to establish the uniqueness of Bonnet mates, which leads us to address the problem of determining when an isometric immersion can be continuously deformed through isometric immersions that preserve the principal curvatures -- a question originally posed in $\mathbb{R}^3$ by Chern~\cite{Chern}. For Bianchi--Cartan--Vr\u{a}nceanu spaces, we complete the local classification of Bonnet pairs by studying the uniqueness of the results obtained by G\'alvez, Mart\'inez and Mira~\cite{GMM}, and we provide new examples of Bonnet mates that were not previously considered. In particular, we prove that the aforesaid continuous deformations only exist for minimal surfaces in the product spaces $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and otherwise only for surfaces with constant principal curvatures. In the case of $\mathrm{Sol}_3$, we give a characterization of Bonnet mates via a system of two differential equations, addressing a problem proposed in~\cite{GMM}. We conclude that the only surfaces admitting continuous isometric deformations that preserve the principal curvatures in $\mathrm{Sol}_3$ are those with constant left-invariant Gauss map.</description>

      <title>A remark on deformation of Gromov non-squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R,r$ be as in the classical Gromov non-squeezing theorem, and let $\epsilon = (\pi R ^{2} - \pi r ^{2})/ \pi r ^{2} $. We first conjecture that the Gromov non-squeezing phenomenon persists for deformations of the symplectic form on the range $C ^{0}$ (w.r.t. the standard metric) $\epsilon $-nearby to the standard symplectic form. We prove this in some special cases, in particular when the dimension is four and when $R &lt; \sqrt 2 r$. Given such a perturbation, we can no longer compactify the range and hence the classical Gromov argument breaks down. Our main method consists of a certain trap idea for holomorphic curves, analogous to traps in dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Tannaka duality statement for geometric stacks in the setting of analytic stacks modelled on globally finitely presented Stein spaces. The key ingredient is the theory of liquid vector spaces and liquid quasicoherent sheaves of Clausen-Scholze. As an application, we reconstruct the topological fundamental group of any complex algebraic variety from its category of liquid local systems. We also reconstruct a series of "twisted fundamental groupoids" whose representations correspond to meromorphic flat connections on the complex affine line with logarithmic or irregular singularities at the origin.</description>
