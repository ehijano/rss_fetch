      <title>Stacking 21-cm Maps around Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters during Reionization: Prospects for a Cross-correlation Detection with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line during the Epoch of Reionization will open a new window to probe the intergalactic medium during the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes. A particularly promising route to an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with spectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs preferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with the surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we study the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking 21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument -- the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a realistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The statistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental response, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically motivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global neutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history. These results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of 21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Control variates from Eulerian and Lagrangian perturbation theory: Application to the bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control variates have seen recent interest as a powerful technique to reduce the variance of summary statistics measured from costly cosmological $N$-body simulations. Of particular interest are the class of control variates which are analytically calculable, such as the recently introduced 'Zeldovich control variates' for the power spectrum of matter and biased tracers. In this work we present the construction of perturbative control variates in Eulerian and Lagrangian perturbation theory, and adopt the matter bispectrum as a case study. Eulerian control variates are analytically tractable for all $n$-point functions, but we show that their correlation with the $N$-body $n$-point function decays at a rate proportional to the sum-of-squared wavenumbers, hampering their utility. We show that the Zeldovich approximation, while possessing an analytically calculable bispectrum, is less correlated at low-$k$ than its Eulerian counterpart. We introduce an alternative -- the 'shifted control variate' -- which can be constructed to have the correct tree-level $n$-point function, is Zeldovich-resummed, and in principle has an analytically tractable bispectrum. We find that applying this shifted control variate to the $z=0.5$ matter bispectrum is equivalent to averaging over $10^4$ simulations for the lowest-$k$ triangles considered. With a single $V=1({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$ $N$-body simulation, for a binning scheme with $N\approx 1400$ triangles from $k_{\rm min} = 0.04 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_{\rm \max} = 0.47 h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, we obtain sub-2% precision for every triangle configuration measured. This work enables the development of accurate bispectrum emulators -- a probe of cosmology well-suited to simulation-based modeling -- and lays the theoretical groundwork to extend control variates for the entire $n$-point hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A million-solar-mass object detected at cosmological distance using gravitational imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure on sub-galactic scales provides important tests of galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. However, such objects are typically too faint to provide robust mass constraints. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely low-mass object detected via its gravitational perturbation to a thin lensed arc observed with milli-arcsecond-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The object was identified using a non-parametric gravitational imaging technique and confirmed using independent parametric modelling. It contains a mass of $m_{\rm 80}=(1.13 \pm 0.04)\times 10^6{M_\odot}$ within a projected radius of 80 parsecs at an assumed redshift of 0.881. This detection is extremely robust and precise, with a statistical significance of 26$\sigma$, a 3.3 per cent fractional uncertainty on $m_{\rm 80}$, and an astrometric uncertainty of 194 $\mu$as. This is the lowest-mass object known to us, by two orders of magnitude, to be detected at a cosmological distance by its gravitational effect. This work demonstrates the observational feasibility of using gravitational imaging to probe the million-solar-mass regime far beyond our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the evolution of the CO excitation ladder through cross-correlation of CONCERTO-like experiments and galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Rotational CO transitions, while acting as a foreground for [C II] line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments, trace the physical conditions of cold gas in galaxies at lower redshifts. Studying these transitions is also crucial for improving component-separation methods as LIM sensitivity increases. Aims: Galaxy-evolution models have so far predicted only the total CO LIM signal. We explore the potential of cross-correlating millimeter-wave LIM data with spectroscopic galaxy surveys to constrain individual CO-line contributions, measure the CO-background spectral line energy distribution (SLED), and derive the cosmic molecular gas density, $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$, up to $z = 3$. Methods: We built 12 light cones of $9~\mathrm{deg}^2$ from the Simulated Infrared Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) simulation. By analyzing cross-power spectra between different CO transitions and the galaxy density field, we recovered the CO background SLED. Combining it with bias-weighted line intensities yielded $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}(z)$. We also assessed the detectability of the CO(4--3) cross-power spectrum with a CONCERTO-like experiment. Results: For a realistic spectroscopic depth, the CO background SLED is accurately recovered up to $J_{\mathrm{up}} = 6$ with $\leq 20%$ uncertainties. Reconstructing $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ from millimeter LIM data requires an excitation correction relative to CO(1--0). Interloper-induced variance does not prevent precise $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimation. In the two-star-formation-mode SIDES model, starbursts dominate the SLED at $J_{\mathrm{up}} \geq 6$ but do not bias $\rho_{\mathrm{H2}}$ estimates from $2 \leq J_{\mathrm{up}} \leq 6$. However, CONCERTO lacks the sensitivity to detect the CO$\times$galaxy cross-power on relevant scales, even under ideal conditions.</description>

      <title>Testing Lens Models of PLCK G165.7+67.0 Using Lensed SN H0pe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova H0pe is a multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and the second lensed SN to yield a measurement of the Hubble constant by the time-delay cosmography method, finding $H_0 = 75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5} \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We investigate the seven lens modeling approaches used to derive $H_0$, assessing their agreement with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ constraints from SN Ia surveys through a purely observational comparison. While photometrically derived magnifications yield distance moduli in line with $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ expectations, our comparison reveals that lens model predictions, even the most precise ones, consistently overestimate the magnification, with a offset of $ \Delta \mu &gt; 1$ mag. This known bias, already appreciated by modeling teams, is independently confirmed through our analysis and highlights the value of lensed SNe as a tool to test model accuracy. If unaccounted for, such magnification biases can propagate into uncertainties in derived cosmological parameters, including $H_0$, and affect the interpretation of future precision measurements. These findings highlight a critical challenge for precision cosmology using strongly lensed transients. With next-generation surveys such as LSST, Roman, and Euclid poised to discover many more gravitationally lensed supernovae, the development and validation of robust, accurate lens models will be essential for using these rare events to probe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Detection of supernova magnitude fluctuations induced by large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar velocities of supernovae and their host galaxies are correlated with the large-scale structure of the Universe, and can be used to constrain the growth rate of structure and test the cosmological model. In this work, we measure the correlation statistics of the large-scale structure traced by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Bright Galaxy Survey Data Release 1 sample, and magnitude fluctuations of type Ia supernova from the Pantheon+ compilation across redshifts z &lt; 0.1. We find a detection of the cross-correlation signal between galaxies and type Ia supernova magnitudes. Fitting the normalised growth rate of structure f sigma_8 to the auto- and cross-correlation function measurements we find f sigma_8 = 0.384 +0.094 -0.157, which is consistent with the Planck LambdaCDM model prediction, and indicates that the supernova magnitude fluctuations are induced by peculiar velocities. Using a large ensemble of N-body simulations, we validate our methodology, calibrate the covariance of the measurements, and demonstrate that our results are insensitive to supernova selection effects. We highlight the potential of this methodology for measuring the growth rate of structure, and forecast that the next generation of type Ia supernova surveys will improve f sigma_8 constraints by a further order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence with Foreground-Marginalised SPT B-mode Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct foreground-marginalised versions of the SPT-3G D1 and SPTpol cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarisation likelihoods. The compression is performed using the CMB-lite framework and we use the resulting data sets to constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence, parametrised by the amplitude of a scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence spectrum, $A_{\rm CB}$. Using the new SPT-3G data we report a $95\%$ upper limit on $A_{\rm CB}$ of $ 1.2\times 10^{-4}$, which tightens to $0.53\times 10^{-4}$ when imposing a prior on the amplitude of gravitational lensing based on CMB lensing reconstruction analyses. These are the tightest constraints on anisotropic birefringence from BB power spectrum measurements to-date, demonstrating the constraining power of the South Pole Telescope. The likelihoods used in this work are made publicly available at https://github.com/lbalkenhol/candl_data</description>

      <title>On the contribution of galaxies to the magnetic field in cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical processes can contribute to magnetic fields within cosmic voids either through magnetized outflows from the astrophysical large-scale structure or through superposition of dipolar contributions from individual galaxies. Such astrophysical magnetic fields represent a foreground to possible space-filling primordial magnetic fields seeded in the early Universe. In this paper, we provide a qualitative description of the screening of magnetic fields by intergalactic plasmas. We find that contributions from superposition of static dipoles are highly suppressed and cannot explain indications for lower bounds based on observations of $\gamma$-ray cascades from high energy sources such as blazars.</description>

      <title>The superclustering of hot gas: cosmological sensitivity in the Websky simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries, such as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used to jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within and beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4 Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter energy density within flat $\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations, to the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in supercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\sim20$ transverse Mpc from massive ($M&gt;5\times10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. The cosmology variations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the halo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal. Our results suggest it is worthwhile to incorporate directional information into SZ-galaxy cross-correlations to increase cosmological sensitivity and help break degeneracies with gas physics.</description>

      <title>Probing departures from $\Lambda$CDM by late-time datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 &gt; -1$ and $\omega_a &lt; 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multiplet Alignment Measurements with Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that measurements of the gravitational tidal field made with spectroscopic redshifts can be improved with information from imaging surveys. The average orientation of small groups of galaxies, or "multiplets" is correlated with large-scale structure and is used to measure the direction of tidal forces. Previously, multiplet intrinsic alignment has been measured in DESI using galaxies that have spectroscopic redshifts. The DESI Legacy Imaging catalog can be used to supplement multiplet catalogs. Our findings show that galaxy positions from the imaging catalog produce a measurement similar to the measurements made with only spectroscopic data. This demonstrates that imaging can improve our signal-to-noise ratio for multiplet alignment in DESI.</description>

      <title>BASILISK III. Stress-testing the Conditional Luminosity Function model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) is an effective and flexible way of characterizing the galaxy-halo connection. However, it is subject to a particular choice for its parametrization, which acts as a prior assumption. Most studies have been restricted to what has become a standard CLF parametrization with little to no variation. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether this model is sufficient to fully characterize the small-scale data extracted from spectroscopic surveys and to gauge how adding or removing degrees of freedom impact the inference regarding the galaxy-halo connection. After extensive validation with realistic mock data, we use Basilisk, a highly constraining Bayesian hierarchical tool to model the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies, to test the standard CLF model against a slew of more flexible variants. In particular, we test whether the SDSS data favour any of these variants in terms of a goodness-of-fit improvement, and identify the models that are sufficiently flexible, beyond which additional model freedom is not demanded by the data. We show that some of these additional degrees of freedom, which have hitherto not been considered, result in a drastic improvement of the fit and cause significant changes in the inferred galaxy-halo connection. This highlights that an empirical model comes with an implicit prior about the parametrization form, which needs to be addressed to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to capture the complexity of the data and to safeguard against a biased inference.</description>

      <title>The dark sector of the Universe as a scalar field in Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Cleaning Galactic foregrounds with spatially varying spectral dependence from CMB observations with \texttt{fgbuster}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of maximum-likelihood parametric component separation for next-generation full-sky CMB polarization experiments, we study the impact of fitting different spectral parameters of Galactic foregrounds in distinct subsets of pixels on the sky, with the goal of optimizing the search for primordial B modes. Using both simulations and analytical arguments, we highlight how the post-component separation uncertainty and systematic foreground residuals in the cleaned CMB power spectrum depend on spatial variations in the spectral parameters. We show that allowing spectral parameters to vary across subsets of the sky pixels is essential to achieve competitive S/N on the reconstructed CMB after component separation while keeping residual foreground bias under control. Although several strategies exist to define pixel subsets for the spectral parameters, each with its advantages and limitations, we show using current foreground simulations in the context of next-generation space-borne missions that there are satisfactory configurations in which both statistical and systematic residuals become negligible. The exact magnitude of these residuals, however, depends on the mission's specific characteristics, especially its frequency coverage and sensitivity. We also show that the post-component separation statistical uncertainty is only weakly dependent on the properties of the foregrounds and propose a semi-analytical framework to estimate it. On the contrary, the systematic foreground residuals highly depend on both the properties of the foregrounds and the chosen spatial resolution of the spectral parameters.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the local density field with combined convolutional and point cloud architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in exponential $f(R)$ gravity model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with the exponential $f(R)$ gravity model, which introduces only one additional parameter $\beta$ compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This model incorporated axions as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both a non-supersymmetric model with heavy right-handed neutrino decay and a supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both cases, we have shown that the required baryonic asymmetry could be obtained. We have also shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with the $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number-violating model parameters are constrained with the $\beta$ through the decoupling temperature. An upper bound on the $\beta$ parameter of the exponential $f(R)$ gravity is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubble-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Axion Perturbations: A General Analytical Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data provides us two key constraints on dark matter (DM): it must have a particular abundance, and it must have an adiabatic spectrum of density perturbations in the early universe. Many different cosmological scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different initial field values $\theta_{\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to the initial condition, $\partial \Omega_a / \partial \theta_{\rm ini}$, which can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential. Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.</description>

      <title>An extended and extremely thin gravitational arc from a lensed compact symmetric object at redshift 2.059</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are thought to be short-lived radio sources with two lobes of emission that are separated by less than a kpc in projection. However, studies of such systems at high redshift is challenging due to the limited resolution of present-day telescopes, and can be biased to the most luminous objects. Here we report imaging of a gravitationally lensed CSO at a redshift of 2.059 using very long baseline interferometry at 1.7 GHz. The data are imaged using Bayesian forward modelling deconvolution, which reveals a spectacularly extended and thin gravitational arc, and several resolved features within the lensed images. The surface brightness of the lensing-corrected source shows two mini-lobes separated by 642 pc in projection, with evidence of multiple hotspots that have brightness temperatures of 10^8.6 to 10^9.2 K, and a total luminosity density of 10^26.3 W / Hz. By combining the well-resolved radio source morphology with previous multi-wavelength studies, we conclude that this object is likely a CSO of type 2, and that the properties are consistent with the bow-shock model for compact radio sources. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining high quality data sets with sophisticated imaging and modelling algorithms for studying the high redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>On the consistent disformal couplings to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models. We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter in a low-scale seesaw setup. The Type-I seesaw framework is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively with the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby forming the neutrino Dirac mass term, while the first doublet is responsible for the mass generation of the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) serves as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced primarily through W and Z boson decays -a previously overlooked dominant contribution that solely determines the relic abundance. Owing to the small vev ($v_{\nu}\sim 10$ MeV) of the second Higgs doublet, an enhancement in the available parameter space of the sterile neutrino masses is observed, spanning from sub-keV to $0.2$ GeV. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations it is found that the setup is able to accommodate both warm and cold dark matter options.</description>

      <title>Robust Measurement of Stellar Streams Around the Milky Way: Correcting Spatially Variable Observational Selection Effects in Optical Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a remarkably rapid buildup of cosmic dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, with complex dust compositions and large abundances already appearing at redshifts $z&gt;6$. Here we present a comprehensive, joint analysis of observations taken with the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of the highly magnified, dusty `normal' galaxy, A1689-zD1 at $z=7.13$. We perform detailed spectro-photometric modeling of the rest-frame UV to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) based on archival photometry of the source and report new rest-frame optical strong-line measurements and metallicity estimates from recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data. We find that despite its substantial dust mass, $M_{\rm dust}\sim 1.5\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$, A1689-zD1 has remarkably low dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios, ${\rm DTG} = (5.1^{+3.0}_{-1.9})\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm DTM} = (6.1^{+3.6}_{-2.3})\times 10^{-2}$, respectively, due to its high metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H}) = 8.36\pm 0.10$ and substantial gas mass, $M_{\rm gas} = (2.8^{+0.2}_{-1.7})\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. The DTG and DTM mass ratios are an order of magnitude lower than expected for galaxies in the local universe with similar chemical enrichment. These low relative measurements are also corroborated by the deficit observed in the $A_V/N_{\rm HI}$ ratio of A1689-zD1 in the line-of-sight. We find that this deviation in the DTG and DTM mass ratios appears to be ubiquitous in other metal-rich galaxies at similar redshifts, $z\gtrsim 6$. This suggests that the processes that form and destroy dust at later times, or the dust emissivity itself, are drastically different for galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic potentials. Based on their symmetry properties, these can induce direct energy shifts or induce atomic electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole as well as nuclear Schiff and anapole moments.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Halo Clustering on Subhalo Anisotropy and Planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that host cold dark matter (CDM) haloes cluster in a manner that depends upon the anisotropy/planarity of their subhaloes, indicating an environmental dependence to subhalo anisotropy/planarity. The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies about central galaxies and correspondingly, the spatial distribution of subhaloes about host haloes have been subjects of interest for two decades. Important questions include the degree to which satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts or exhibit planarity in their distributions and the degree to which this anisotropy depends upon the environment of the host-satellite system. We study the spatial distributions of subhaloes in a cosmological N-body simulation. We find that CDM subhaloes are distributed in a manner that is strongly anisotropic/planar, in agreement with prior work, though our presentation is complementary. The more novel result is that this anisotropy has an environmental dependence. Systems which exhibit less (more) anisotropy and less (more) planarity cluster more strongly (weakly). Systems in which subhaloes reside further from their host centres cluster more weakly. None of these clustering effects are caused by a correlation between subhalo anisotropy/planarity and other properties on which host halo clustering is known to depend, such as concentration, spin parameter, host halo shape, or subhalo count. We discuss the impact of this result on the anisotropy of satellites as predicted by CDM, its testability, and its possible relation to anisotropy observed about the large galaxies of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Forecasts from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in 21cm Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we use a template method to extract the scale associated with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal in 21cm neutral hydrogen intensity maps. We then forecast the constraints on the standard deviations of cosmological parameters using a Fisher matrix analysis. In order to test this method, we choose the survey configuration for the BINGO telescope. We then estimate the constraints on the BAO shift parameter $\alpha$, which we extract from the 21cm angular power spectrum (APS). In addition, we translate those results into constraints on the final cosmological parameters. As BAO data alone can only constrain the product of the Hubble constant and the sound horizon $H_0r_s$, degeneracies between the variables mean that we can't get useful constraints with BAO data alone. We break these degeneracies by combining the 21cm intensity mapping BAO results with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) covariances obtained by the Planck satellite. In particular, we find that the best forecasts we can get with this combination are on the standard deviations of the Hubble parameter $\sigma_h$, and the dark energy parameters $\sigma_{w_0}$ and $\sigma_{w_a}$. We find $\sigma_h = 0.0055\;(0.8\%)$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. For the $w$CDM model, we find $\sigma_h = 0.020\;(2.9\%)$ and $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.075\;(7.5\%)$. In the CPL parameterization, we find $\sigma_h = 0.029\;(4.4\%)$, $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.40\;(40\%)$, and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.7$. Finally, we observe that using the full APS provides stronger constraints than the BAO only, however, it is more susceptible to systematic effects.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to investigating axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) by studying their potential conversion into X-rays within the Sun's atmospheric magnetic field. Utilizing high-sensitivity data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) collected during the 2020 solar minimum, along with advanced solar atmospheric magnetic field models, we establish a new limit on the axion-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 7.3\times 10^{-12}$~GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% CL for axion masses $m_a\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$\,eV. This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of $m_a\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{-4}$\,eV. These findings mark a significant advancement in our ability to probe axion properties and strengthen indirect searches for dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>How do uncertainties in galaxy formation physics impact field-level galaxy bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our ability to extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys is limited by uncertainties in the galaxy-dark matter halo relationship for a given galaxy population, which are governed by the intricacies of galaxy formation. To quantify these uncertainties, we examine quenched and star-forming galaxies using two distinct approaches to modeling galaxy formation: UniverseMachine, an empirical semianalytic model, and the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a second-order hybrid N-body perturbative bias expansion to each galaxy sample, enabling direct comparison of modeling approaches and revealing how uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection affect bias parameters and non-Poisson noise across number densities and redshifts. Notably, we find that quenched and star-forming galaxies occupy distinct parts of the bias parameter space, and that the scatter induced from these different galaxy formation models is small when conditioned on similar selections of galaxies. We also detect the signature of assembly bias in our samples; this leads to small but significant deviations from analytic bias predictions, while assembly bias-removed samples match these predictions well. This work indicates that galaxy samples from a spectrum of reasonable, physically motivated models for galaxy formation give a relatively small range of field-level galaxy bias parameters. We estimate a set of priors from these models that should be useful in extracting cosmological constraints from luminous red galaxy- and emission line galaxy-like samples. Looking forward, careful estimates of the range of impacts of galaxy formation, for a given sample and cosmological analysis, will be an essential ingredient for extracting the most precise cosmological information from current and future large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 Results II: Measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmological Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from more than 14 million galaxies and quasars drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), based on three years of operation. For cosmology inference, these galaxy measurements are combined with DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ forest BAO results presented in a companion paper. The DR2 BAO results are consistent with DESI DR1 and SDSS, and their distance-redshift relationship matches those from recent compilations of supernovae (SNe) over the same redshift range. The results are well described by a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but the parameters preferred by BAO are in mild, $2.3\sigma$ tension with those determined from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), although the DESI results are consistent with the acoustic angular scale $\theta_*$ that is well-measured by Planck. This tension is alleviated by dark energy with a time-evolving equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, which provides a better fit to the data, with a favored solution in the quadrant with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. This solution is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at $3.1\sigma$ for the combination of DESI BAO and CMB data. When also including SNe, the preference for a dynamical dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM ranges from $2.8-4.2\sigma$ depending on which SNe sample is used. We present evidence from other data combinations which also favor the same behavior at high significance. From the combination of DESI and CMB we derive 95% upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.064$ eV assuming $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.16$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ model. Unless there is an unknown systematic error associated with one or more datasets, it is clear that $\Lambda$CDM is being challenged by the combination of DESI BAO with other measurements and that dynamical dark energy offers a possible solution.</description>

      <title>Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring individual detections. Through the wavelength--redshift relation, one can map the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the brightest features in the infrared spectra of galaxies: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that $S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can be achieved at $z &lt; 0.5$ and $1 &lt; z &lt; 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively, for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Large Optical Depths on the Non-Gaussian 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios, whereas for moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes from Planck 2018 and Other Cosmological Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing, BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1 \sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 = 2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.</description>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w&lt;-1$ and then relaxes to $w&gt;-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of global networks of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performances of a world-wide network made by a European third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector, together with a 40km Cosmic Explorer detector in the US, considering three scenarios for the European detector: (1) Einstein Telescope (ET) in its 10km triangle configuration; (2) ET in its configuration featuring two 15km L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics (underground, and with each detector made of a high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-frequency interferometer); (3) A single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET sensitivity curve, either with 15km or with 20km arm length. Overall, we find that, if a configuration with two widely separated L-shaped detectors ("2L") should be retained for ET, the network made by a single-L European underground detector together with CE-40km could already provide a very interesting intermediate step toward the construction of a full 2L+CE network, and is in any case superior to a 10km triangle not inserted in an international network. We also study the performance of a network made by a single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET sensitivity curve together with a single 40km CE and with LIGO-India (taken at A# sensitivity), and we find that it also has very interesting performances.</description>

      <title>Lectures in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detectability of EEs can be significantly enhanced in the presence of eccentricity, even for $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\lesssim0.2$, substantially increasing the prospects for detection in ground based detectors. Our results highlight the unique potential of modeling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <title>DESI Emission-line Galaxies: Clustering Dependence on Stellar Mass and [OII] Luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the projected two-point correlation functions of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) One-Percent Survey and model their dependence on stellar mass and [OII] luminosity. We select $\sim$180,000 ELGs with redshifts of $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$ and define 27 samples according to cuts in redshift and both galaxy properties. Following a framework that describes the conditional [OII] luminosity-stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of $\sim$10$^{12.2-12.4}$ $h^{-1} M_\odot$. We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a consequence of the 0.5 dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates. The model shows a trend between galaxy bias and [OII] luminosity at high redshift ($1.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$) that is otherwise absent at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Are all Binary Black Holes Detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Following the Universal Time-Delay Distributions? Probably Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.</description>
