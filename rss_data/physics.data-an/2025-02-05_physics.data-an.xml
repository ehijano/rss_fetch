      <title>A Fast Periodicity Detection Algorithm Sensitive to Arbitrary Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reexamination of period finding algorithms is prompted by new large area astronomical sky surveys that can identify billions of individual sources having a thousand or more observations per source. This large increase in data necessitates fast and efficient period detection algorithms. In this paper, we provide an initial description of an algorithm that is being used for detection of periodic behavior in a sample of 1.5 billion objects using light curves generated from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data (Bellm et al. 2019; Masci et al. 2018). We call this algorithm "Fast Periodicity Weighting" (FPW), derived using a Gaussian Process (GP) formalism. A major advantage of the FPW algorithm for ZTF analysis is that it is agnostic to the details of the phase-folded waveform. Periodic sources in ZTF show a wide variety of waveforms, some quite complex, including eclipsing objects, sinusoidally varying objects also exhibiting eclipses, objects with cyclotron emission at various phases, and accreting objects with complex waveforms. We describe the FPW algorithm and its application to ZTF, and provide efficient code for both CPU and GPU.</description>

      <title>Exploring blazars through sonification. Visual and auditory insights into multifrequency variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazers, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazers.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the exciton polaron by serial femtosecond crystallography on single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outstanding opto-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites have been related to the formation of polarons. Nevertheless, the observation of the atomistic deformation brought about by one electron-hole pair in these materials has remained elusive. Here, we measure the diffraction patterns of single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots (QDs) with and without resonant excitation in the single exciton limit using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). By reconstructing the 3D differential diffraction pattern, we observe small shifts of the Bragg peaks indicative of a crystal-wide deformation field. Building on DFT calculations, we show that these shifts are consistent with the lattice distortion induced by a delocalized electron and a localized hole, forming a mixed large/small exciton polaron. This result creates a clear picture of the polaronic deformation in CsPbBr$_3$ QDs, highlights the exceptional sensitivity of SFX to lattice distortions in few-nanometer crystallites, and establishes an experimental platform for future studies of electron-lattice interactions.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>
