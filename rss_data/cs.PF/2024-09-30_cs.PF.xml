      <title>Balanced Splitting: A Framework for Achieving Zero-wait in the Multiserver-job Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for designing nonpreemptive and job-size oblivious scheduling policies in the multiserver-job queueing model. The main requirement is to identify a static and balanced sub-partition of the server set and ensure that the servers in each set of that sub-partition can only handle jobs of a given class and in a first-come first-served order. A job class is determined by the number of servers to which it has exclusive access during its entire execution and the probability distribution of its service time. This approach aims to reduce delays by preventing small jobs from being blocked by larger ones that arrived first, and it is particularly beneficial when the job size variability intra resp. inter classes is small resp. large. In this setting, we propose a new scheduling policy, Balanced-Splitting. We provide a sufficient condition for the stability of Balanced-Splitting and show that the resulting queueing probability, i.e., the probability that an arriving job needs to wait for processing upon arrival, vanishes in both the subcritical (the load is kept fixed to a constant less than one) and critical (the load approaches one from below) many-server limiting regimes. Crucial to our analysis is a connection with the M/GI/s/s queue and Erlang's loss formula, which allows our analysis to rely on fundamental results from queueing theory. Numerical simulations show that the proposed policy performs better than several preemptive/nonpreemptive size-aware/oblivious policies in various practical scenarios. This is also confirmed by simulations running on real traces from High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads. The delays induced by Balanced-Splitting are also competitive with those induced by state-of-the-art policies such as First-Fit-SRPT and ServerFilling-SRPT, though our approach has the advantage of not requiring preemption, nor the knowledge of job sizes.</description>

      <title>Toward Greener Matrix Operations by Lossless Compressed Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in machine learning, scientific computing, and graph algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the space, time, and energy efficiency of SpMV using various compressed formats for large sparse matrices, focusing specifically on Boolean matrices and real-valued vectors.
  Through extensive analysis and experiments conducted on server and edge devices, we found that different matrix compression formats offer distinct trade-offs among space usage, execution time, and energy consumption. Notably, by employing the appropriate compressed format, we can reduce energy consumption by an order of magnitude on both server and single-board computers. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that while data parallelism can enhance execution speed and energy efficiency, achieving simultaneous time and energy efficiency presents partially distinct challenges. Specifically, we show that for certain compression schemes, the optimal degree of parallelism for time does not align with that for energy, thereby challenging prevailing assumptions about a straightforward linear correlation between execution time and energy consumption.
  Our results have significant implications for software engineers in all domains where SpMV operations are prevalent. They also suggest that similar studies exploring the trade-offs between time, space, and energy for other compressed data structures can substantially contribute to designing more energy-efficient software components.</description>

      <title>Cluster-BPI: Efficient Fine-Grain Blind Power Identification for Defending against Hardware Thermal Trojans in Multicore SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern multicore System-on-Chips (SoCs) feature hardware monitoring mechanisms that measure total power consumption. However, these aggregate measurements are often insufficient for fine-grained thermal and power management. This paper presents an enhanced Clustering Blind Power Identification (ICBPI) approach, designed to improve the sensitivity and robustness of the traditional Blind Power Identification (BPI) method. BPI estimates the power consumption of individual cores and models the thermal behavior of an SoC using only thermal sensor data and total power measurements. The proposed ICBPI approach refines BPI's initialization process, particularly improving the non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) step, which is critical to the accuracy of BPI. ICBPI introduces density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to better align temperature and power consumption data, thereby providing more accurate power consumption estimates. We validate the ICBPI method through two key tasks. The first task evaluates power estimation accuracy across four different multicore architectures, including a heterogeneous processor. Results show that ICBPI significantly enhances accuracy, reducing error rates by 77.56% compared to the original BPI and by 68.44% compared to the state-of-the-art BPISS method. The second task focuses on improving the detection and localization of malicious thermal sensor attacks in heterogeneous processors. The results demonstrate that ICBPI enhances the security and robustness of multicore SoCs against such attacks.</description>

      <title>An Autotuning-based Optimization Framework for Mixed-kernel SVM Classifications in Smart Pixel Datasets and Heterojunction Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art classification method widely used in science and engineering due to its high accuracy, its ability to deal with high dimensional data, and its flexibility in modeling diverse sources of data. In this paper, we propose an autotuning-based optimization framework to quantify the ranges of hyperparameters in SVMs to identify their optimal choices, and apply the framework to two SVMs with the mixed-kernel between Sigmoid and Gaussian kernels for smart pixel datasets in high energy physics (HEP) and mixed-kernel heterojunction transistors (MKH). Our experimental results show that the optimal selection of hyperparameters in the SVMs and the kernels greatly varies for different applications and datasets, and choosing their optimal choices is critical for a high classification accuracy of the mixed kernel SVMs. Uninformed choices of hyperparameters C and coef0 in the mixed-kernel SVMs result in severely low accuracy, and the proposed framework effectively quantifies the proper ranges for the hyperparameters in the SVMs to identify their optimal choices to achieve the highest accuracy 94.6\% for the HEP application and the highest average accuracy 97.2\% with far less tuning time for the MKH application.</description>
