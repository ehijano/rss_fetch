      <title>Dark Matter Detector Radioimpurities $^{129}$I and $^{210}$Pb Measured with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sodium iodide crystals doped with thallium NaI(Tl) can be used as detector material for direct dark matter detection by taking advantage of their particle detection properties of scintillation. In order to achieve this, it is crucial that these crystals are of ultra-high purity. Radioimpurities within the crystals may potentially mimic dark matter signals and thus must be quantified, minimised where possible and distinguished from real events. Abundances of radionuclides $^{129}$I and $^{210}$Pb, which are dominant sources of radioimpurities in NaI(Tl) crystals, were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry at the Australian National University (ANU) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). NaI powder chemically processed to AgI, and, for the first time, unprocessed NaI powder, were shown to be suitable as AMS targets. A consistent $^{129}$I/$^{127}$I ratio of (2.0 $\pm$ 0.3) x 10$^{-13}$ was measured in three different commercially available NaI powders. Therefore, it was concluded that the choice of NaI powder has a negligible influence on the $^{129}$I contribution to low-background dark matter experiments. For $^{210}$Pb, different Pb molecular ion species were assessed with PbO$_2^-$ being the preferred species and applied to investigate different lead oxide compounds for their suitability as Pb carriers. A $^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of (3.6 $\pm$ $^{1.7}_{1.4}$) x 10$^{-15}$ was measured in Pb$_3$O$_4$ powder. This met the required lower activity limit of $^{210}$Pb when adding 1 mg of stable lead into 1 kg of NaI(Tl) powder with a desired maximum $^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of 1 x 10$^{-14}$. These results indicate the suitability of the investigated Pb$_3$O$_4$ as a potential carrier for incorporation with Pb extracted from NaI used for dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Bayesian Optimized Beam Steering at TRIUMF-ISAC's MEBT and HEBT Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for operationalzing Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported centroid correction algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>

      <title>ILC250 Cost Update -- 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider was conceived as a global project for an energy-frontier electron-positron collider.It employs superconducting RF and nano-beam technologies with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. Its cost was estimated in 2013, based on the Technical Design Report published in 2013.Japan's high-energy community proposed to host the ILC in Japan as a Higgs boson factory at 250 GeV in its first phase, and a revised cost estimate was conducted in 2017 to host it in Japan. However, due to global price increases and currency fluctuations that emerged afterward, the 2017 estimate is now outdated. A new cost evaluation has therefore been performed, according for global inflation tends, exchange rate shifts, and recent experiences in SRF based accelerators. This report describes the cost update performed in 2024. The cost update is included in the ILC Status Report in May 2025, contributing to the ongoing 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>
