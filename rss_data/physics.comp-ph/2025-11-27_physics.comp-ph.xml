      <title>Differentiable Physics-Neural Models enable Learning of Non-Markovian Closures for Accelerated Coarse-Grained Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Computational Electromagnetics Methods for Superconducting Circuit Quantum Device Modeling: A Practical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.</description>

      <title>Physics Steering: Causal Control of Cross-Domain Concepts in a Physics Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of thermo-diffusively unstable premixed hydrogen-air flames in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=530$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of premixed hydrogen-air flames anchored in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) are performed at a friction Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=530$ and thermochemical conditions susceptible to the emergence of intrinsic thermo-diffusive (TD) phenomena acting on the turbulent flame. Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it.
  The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena.
  At $\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed.</description>

      <title>AI4X Roadmap: Artificial Intelligence for the advancement of scientific pursuit and its future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{CRLS}$: Convolutional Regularized Least Squares Framework for Reduced Order Modeling of Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a convolutional regularized least squares ($\texttt{CRLS}$) framework for reduced-order modeling of transonic flows with shocks. Conventional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced models are attractive because of their optimality and low online cost; however, but they perform poorly when snapshots contain parameter-dependent discontinuities, leading to smeared shocks, stair-stepping, or non-physical oscillations. In $\texttt{CRLS}$, we first map each full-order snapshot to a smoother representation by applying a one-dimensional Gaussian convolution with reflect padding along the flow field coordinates. The convolution hyperparameters (kernel width and support) are selected automatically by Bayesian optimization on a held-out set of snapshots. POD bases are then extracted from the smoothed data, and the parametric dependence of the POD coefficients is learned via radial basis function interpolation. To recover sharp shock structures, we introduce an efficient deconvolution step formulated as a regularized least squares problem, where the regularization centers the reconstruction around a nearest-neighbor reference snapshot in parameter space. The resulting $\texttt{CRLS}$ surrogate is evaluated on inviscid transonic flow over the RAE2822 airfoil, modeled by the steady compressible Euler equations solved with SU2 over a Latin hypercube sample of Mach number and angle of attack. Compared with standard POD and smoothed-POD baselines, $\texttt{CRLS}$ yields markedly improved shock location and strength, lower surface-pressure and field-level errors, and a $42$\% reduction in the number of POD modes required to capture a fixed fraction of snapshot energy. These results demonstrate that $\texttt{CRLS}$ provides an accurate, data-efficient, and largely automated route to shock-aware reduced order models for high-speed aerodynamic design.</description>

      <title>Unified interface dipole theory for Fermi level pinning effect at metal-semiconductor contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified bond dipole theory for metal-semiconductor interfaces to explain the microscopic origin of interface dipoles and Fermi level pinning (FLP) in terms of Harrison's bond-orbital model. By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Computation Made Easy: A Practical Guide to ABC-SMC for Dynamical Systems with \texttt{pymc}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems.

      <title>Rapid ground state energy estimation with a Sparse Pauli Dynamics-enabled Variational Double Bracket Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Edge-Dependent Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>A two-sided subgrid-scale model for mass transfer across fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of extremely thin concentration boundary layers at fluid interfaces for high local P\'eclet numbers is a severe obstacle for efficient and accurate numerical simulation of mass transfer processes in two-phase fluid systems. Especially challenging are liquid-liquid systems, in which thin concentration boundary layers can appear on both sides of the fluid interface under convection-dominated conditions. In those cases, the one-sided species concentrations at the interface are a-priori not even known approximately, but are determined by a conjugate mass transfer problem governed by interfacial jump conditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge we for the first time introduce a two-sided Subgrid-Scale (SGS) boundary layer model for conjugate mass transfer at fluid interfaces. It accurately computes the local mass transfer rates on moderate or coarse mesh resolutions even when very high concentration gradients in interface vicinity occur. For this purpose, SGS modeling is applied on both sides of an interface transmissive to passive scalars, such as the interface in a two-phase fluid system, enabling the accurate capture of conjugate mass transfer across thin boundary layer on one or on both sides of the interface. We implement our approach in the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface-Tracking (ALE-IT) OpenFOAM module twoPhaseInterTrackFoam. We have made twoPhaseInterTrackFoam publicly available in our previous publication (Schwarzmeier et al., 2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol.

      <title>Freeze-and-release direct optimization method for variational calculations of excited electronic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational optimization of orbitals in time-independent density functional calculations of excited electronic states presents a significant challenge, as excited states typically correspond to saddle points on the electronic energy landscape. The optimization can be particularly difficult if the excitation involves significant rearrangement of the electron density, as for charge transfer excitations. A simple strategy for variational orbital optimization of excited states is presented. The approach involves minimizing the energy while freezing the orbitals directly involved in the excitation, followed by a fully unconstrained saddle point optimization. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy are carried out using direct optimization algorithms with the same computational scaling as ground state calculations. The performance of the method is extensively assessed in calculations of intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer excited states of organic molecules and molecular dimers using a generalized gradient approximation functional. It is found that the freeze-and-release direct optimization approach can avoid variational collapse to spurious, charge-delocalized solutions for cases where conventional algorithms based on the maximum overlap method fail. For intermolecular charge transfer, the orbital-optimized calculations are found to provide the correct dependency of the energy on the donor-acceptor separation without requiring long-range exact exchange, something common time-dependent density functional theory approaches fail to achieve.</description>

      <title>SPARSE: Scattering Poles and Amplitudes from Radial Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a large system of radial Schr\"odinger equations for scattering states. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The $K$-matrix for physical energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of the system by comparison to the analytical real solutions at large distances. Scattering poles and amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix.</description>

      <title>Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, achieving high accuracy with energy errors equivalent to an effective temperature of 0.2 (in units of the Kitaev interactions), consistent with the experimentally relevant spin-liquid regime. Starting from these states, we apply controlled perturbations and measure time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a non-zero Chern number, a hallmark of topological order, which vanishes upon transition to the Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics, while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses of Condensation for Enhanced Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phenomena such as entanglement provide powerful resources for enhancing classical sensing. Here, we theoretically show that collective entanglement of spin qubits, arising from a condensation of particle-hole pairs, can strongly amplify transitions between ground and excited spin states, potentially improving signal contrast in optically detected magnetic resonance. This collective state exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms.</description>
