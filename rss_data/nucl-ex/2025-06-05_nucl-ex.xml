      <title>Extremely large oblate deformation of the first excited state in $^{12}$C: a new challenge to modern nuclear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Coulomb-excitation study of the high-lying first excited state at 4.439 MeV in the nucleus $^{12}$C has been carried out using the $^{208}$Pb($^{12}$C,$^{12}$C$^*$)$^{208}$Pb$^*$ reaction at 56 MeV and the {\sc Q3D} magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz Laboratorium in Munich. High-statistics achieved with an average beam intensity of approximately 10$^{11}$ ions/s together with state-of-the-art {\it ab initio} calculations of the nuclear dipole polarizability permitted the accurate determination of the spectroscopic quadrupole moment, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.076(30)$~eb, in agreement with previous measurements. Combined with previous work, a weighted average of $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.090(14)$ eb is determined, which includes the re-analysis of a similar experiment by Vermeer and collaborators, $Q_{_S}(2_{_1}^+) = +0.103(20)$~eb. Such a large oblate deformation challenges modern nuclear theory and emphasizes the need of $\alpha$ clustering and associated triaxiality effects for full convergence of $E2$ collective properties.</description>

      <title>Quenching of single-particle strength inferred from nucleon-removal transfer reactions on $^{15}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference in the proton and neutron separation energies ($\Delta S$) of the weakly bound $^{15}$C ground state is -19.86 MeV, an extreme value. Data from intermediate-energy heavy-ion induced (HI-induced) knockout reactions on nuclei spanning $-20\lesssim\Delta S\lesssim+20$ MeV, suggest that the degree to which single-particle strength is quenched, $R\mathrm{_{s}}$, has a negative correlation with $\Delta S$, decreasing from unity around $-20$~MeV to around 0.2 at $+20$~MeV. For the $^{15}$C ground state ($R_s=0.96(4)$ in HI-induced knockout), contrasting results have recently been obtained via the neutron-adding transfer reaction, which reveal a value of $R_s=0.64(15)$, similar to the value observed at modest $\Delta S$ and more extreme values of $\Delta S$ with reaction probes other than HI knockout. In order to explore the any potential differences between $adding$ and $removing$ processes in transfer reactions at extreme $\Delta S$, single-neutron removal transfer reactions on $^{15}$C were performed at 7.1MeV/u in inverse kinematics. The removal of a valence neutron in 2$s_{1/2}$ orbit using both ($p$,$d$) and ($d$,$t$) reactions shows consistent quenching factors and agrees with those from the neutron-adding reaction. The present results, which can be compared with neutron knockout reaction, suggest that correlations, represented by the quenching factor, show limited dependence on neutron-proton asymmetry under the most extreme asymmetry conditions so far achieved in transfer reactions.</description>

      <title>The precision measurement of the electron anti-neutrino spectrum in beta-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ electron antineutrino source is one of the most suitable radiochemical sources for experiments searching for the oscillations of active neutrinos to the light sterile state. In the current work the $\beta$-spectra of $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ source have been measured by two types of $\beta$-spectrometers based on silicon Si(Li) detectors in order to determine the energy spectrum of electron anti-neutrino emitted in the $\beta$-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei. The nuclear form factor of the ground state beta transition in $\rm{^{144}Pr - ^{144}Nd}$ has been obtained with high precision: $C(W) = 1 + (-0.0279\pm 0.0003)W + (-0.076\pm 0.003)W^{-1}$. The reduced cross section for the inverse beta decay reaction on hydrogen for the $\rm{{^{144}Pr}}$ electron anti-neutrino source has been defined as $\rm{(4.7448 \pm 0.0006_{stat} \pm 0.012_{syst}) \times 10^{-44}~cm^2 {decay}^{-1}}$ that provides sufficient sensitivity to search for a sterile neutrino with a mass of $m_4 \sim 1$~eV and a mixing angle $Sin^2(2\theta_{14}) \sim 0.005$ using standard disappearance method.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dominant hadronic uncertainty in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ per mille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a one-loop $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering to the sub-permille level, $\lesssim 1$ per mille.</description>

      <title>Modelling Coincident Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two photon-initiated production, focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous near threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Event Topology Classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>The influence of nuclear short range correlations on sub-threshold particle production in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The apparent production of (multi-)strange baryons and mesons at sub-threshold energies in proton-heavy ion collisions is a consequence of short range correlations (SRC), which have recently been observed in lepton-nucleus scattering. They may enhance the available center of mass energy of individual nucleon-nucleon collisions and allow, therefore, for sub-threshold particle production in proton-nucleus collisions. Calculations demonstrate that SRC enhance the probability for particle production at nominal sub-threshold energies up to a factor of $\times 10^3$ as compared to a simple Fermi gas model. We benchmark the idea by calculating the $\Xi^-$ multiplicity in nominal sub-threshold p+Nb collisions which compare well with the data measured by the HADES collaboration. These findings are of prime relevance for upcoming experiments at the FAIR facility, especially for the study of charmed hadrons.</description>

      <title>Accessing proton number fluctuations in limited regions of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent ultracold neutron transmission in D$_2$ gas $-$ a test of the Young-Koppel model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Young-Koppel model (YK) describes comprehensively the interaction of slow neutrons with diatomic gases such as H$_2$ and D$_2$. This paper reports on the first experimental results of ultracold neutron (UCN) scattering over a wide temperature range vindicating the YK model for gaseous D$_2$ and showing an important difference in the temperature dependence to a low-energy low-temperature approximation (LETA). LETA is confirmed, however, to be valid for monoatomic gases such as Ne. Calculated cross sections for other noble gases were also confirmed for ultracold neutrons. Finally, the total cross section of UCNs in H$_2$ gas was measured and analyzed applying the Young-Koppel model, however, in a more limited temperature range, confirming the theoretical prediction.</description>

      <title>Nuclear clustering process in heavy-ion collisions : experimental constraints on the low-temperature region of the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the production of Hydrogen and Helium isotopes in heavy-ion collisions in the incident energy range between 80 and 150 MeV/nucleon. We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the transverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal model. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the experimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be explicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the experimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained we complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical models to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy measurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out region in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase diagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is a common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering processes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>
