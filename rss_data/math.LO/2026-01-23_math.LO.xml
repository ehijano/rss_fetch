      <title>Problems with fixpoints of polynomials of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in computable analysis, we study fixpoints of certain endofunctors over categories of containers. More specifically, we focus on fibred endofunctors over the fibrewise opposite of the codomain fibration that can be themselves be represented by families of polynomial endofunctors. In this setting, we show how to compute initial algebras, terminal coalgebras and another kind of fixpoint $\zeta$. We then explore a number of examples of derived operators inspired by Weihrauch complexity and the usual construction of the free polynomial monad.
  We introduce $\zeta$-expressions as the syntax of $\mu$-bicomplete categories, extended with $\zeta$-binders and parallel products, which thus have a natural denotation in containers. By interpreting certain $\zeta$-expressions in a category of type 2 computable maps, we are able to capture a number of meaningful Weihrauch degrees, ranging from closed choice on $\{0, 1\}$ to determinacy of infinite parity games, via an "answerable part" operator.</description>

      <title>Existential Positive Transductions of Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monadic stability generalizes many tameness notions from structural graph theory such as planarity, bounded degree, bounded tree-width, and nowhere density. The sparsification conjecture predicts that the (possibly dense) monadically stable graph classes are exactly those that can be logically encoded by first-order (FO) transductions in the (always sparse) nowhere dense classes. So far this conjecture has been verified for several special cases, such as for classes of bounded shrub-depth, and for the monadically stable fragments of bounded (linear) clique-width, twin-width, and merge-width.
  In this work we propose the existential positive sparsification conjecture, predicting that the more restricted co-matching-free, monadically stable classes are exactly those that can be transduced from nowhere dense classes using only existential positive FO formulas. While the general conjecture remains open, we verify its truth for all known special cases of the original conjecture. Even stronger, we find the sparse preimages as subgraphs of the dense input graphs.
  As a key ingredient, we introduce a new combinatorial operation, called subflip, that arises as the natural co-matching-free analog of the flip operation, which is a central tool in the characterization of monadic stability. Using subflips, we characterize the co-matching-free fragment of monadic stability by appropriate strengthenings of the known flip-flatness and flipper game characterizations for monadic stability. In an attempt to generalize our results to the more expressive MSO logic, we discover (rediscover?) that on relational structures (existential) positive MSO has the same expressive power as (existential) positive FO.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.
  We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>

      <title>A countable-support symmetric iteration separating PP from AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, from a ground model of $ZFC$, a transitive symmetric model $M$ satisfying $ZF + DC + PP + AC_{wo} + \neg AC$. The construction starts with a Cohen symmetric seed model $N$ over $Add(\omega,\omega_1)$ and performs an Ord-length countable-support symmetric iteration. For fixed parameters $S:=A^\omega$ and $T:=PowerSet(S)$ (as computed in $N$), successor stages add orbit-symmetrized packages which force the localized splitting principle $PP^{\mathrm{split}}\!\restriction T$ (hence $PP\restriction T$) and the choice principle $AC_{wo}$, while preserving $DC$ and keeping $A$ non-well-orderable. A diagonal-lift/diagonal-cancellation scheme produces $\omega_1$-complete normal limit filters. A persistence argument yields $SVC^+(T)$ in M, and Ryan--Smith localization then upgrades $PP\restriction T$ and $AC_{wo}$ to $PP$.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>
