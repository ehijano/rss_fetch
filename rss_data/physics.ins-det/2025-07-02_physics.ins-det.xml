      <title>Test mass charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space based on UV micro-LED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative to the ultraviolet light emitting diode(UV LED), the feasibility of utilizing UV micro-LED in the charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space is experimentally studied. Compared with UV LED, micro-LED is more compact in size, has better current spreading, faster response time and longer operating life. Performance characteristics of micro-LEDs were measured, with peak wavelength of 254 nm, 262 nm, 274 nm, and 282 nm for each respective micro-LED, and the photoelectric effect was demonstrated. The effectiveness of micro-LED based charge management experiments were demonstrated using above micro-LEDs mounted on a cubical test mass, and different discharge rates were achieved by varying the drive current and duty cycle using pulse width modulation(PWM). Laboratory data was also shown to demonstrate the space qualification of the micro-LED device, the key electrical and optical characteristics of the micro-LEDs showed less than 5% variation. The results of the qualification bring the micro-LED device Technology Readiness Level(TRL) to TRL-5. TRL-6 will be reached provided additional radiation and thermal tests are conducted and in a position ready to be flown and further tested in space.</description>

      <title>Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRIDENT experiment is a planned neutrino observatory at West Pacific Ocean to search for astrophysical neutrinos. The final full-scale detector array is expected to have about 1000 strings, each of which consists of 20 hybrid digital optical modules. Each module will contain a number of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers to detect Cherenkov lights. In this paper, we present a custom designed digitization mainboard for the TRIDENT experiment. It includes PMT waveform digitization at a sampling rate of 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters, and time digitization using time-to-digital converters implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We present its design and the first performances.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of high-strength, radiopure, electroformed copper-based alloys for rare-event searches: A materials design perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-event searches are key to unveiling the constituents of dark matter and to understanding the nature of neutrinos. These endeavors demand detectors with exceptionally low levels of radioactivity, leading to breakthroughs in related techniques. In this context, additive-free electroformed copper has emerged as the material of choice thanks to its excellent radiopurity, favorable physical properties, and affordable cost. However, its high ductility and limited mechanical strength pose challenges for its use in detectors. Recently, electroformed copper-chromium alloys have been proposed, with early investigations suggesting that small chromium admixtures lead to enhanced strength while maintaining radiopurity.
  Electroformed copper-based alloys are investigated from a materials design perspective to address current challenges and optimize the processing of materials. Modeling tools based on computational thermodynamics are used to predict material properties following thermal processing. In addition to chromium, the use of titanium as an additional alloying component for superior mechanical strength is explored. The findings suggest a path towards the design of high-performance, radiopure copper-based alloys suitable for next-generation rare-event experiments, while minimizing lengthy and expensive trial-and-error approaches. The impact on future experiments is exemplified through the case of the DarkSPHERE and XLZD experiments.</description>

      <title>A high-temperature furnace for multi-modal synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy and diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design, calibration, and initial application of a non-contact high-temperature furnace developed for in situ synchrotron X-ray experiments are presented. The system enables a stable operation up to 1000 {\deg}C, with heating rates exceeding 6000 {\deg}C/min and thermal stability better than {\pm}2 {\deg}C. Temperature calibration was performed using (i) direct measurements with a thermocouple to characterize heating and cooling ramp rates and map temperature gradients along the x, y, and z axes, and (ii) synchrotron X-ray diffraction to track the ferrite-to-austenite (BCC to FCC) phase transition in an iron grain under beamline conditions. The furnace's contactless geometry provides full translational and rotational freedom, with 360{\deg} rotation and wide tilt capabilities, making it fully compatible with a range of diffraction and imaging techniques. Its 3D-printed modular body includes closable apertures for auxiliary functions such as active cooling or X-ray fluorescence. The design is easily customizable for diverse experimental requirements and can be adapted to most beamlines. The furnace has been implemented at the ID03 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) which supports Dark field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM), 3D X-ray Diffraction (3DXRD), magnified topotomography (MTT), phase-contrast tomography (PCT) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT). As a first application, a DFXM case study on a cold-rolled Al1050 sample during isothermal annealing is presented. The imaging of a selected grain before and after the heat treatment reveals strain relaxation and grain growth. This furnace offers a robust and flexible platform for high-temperature synchrotron studies across materials science, including metals, ceramics, and energy materials. It is now part of the ESRF sample environment pool and is available to all users.</description>

      <title>AstroECP: towards more practical Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based technique that enables bulk-sample characterization of crystallographic defects (e.g. dislocations, stacking faults, low angle boundaries). Despite its potential, ECCI remains underused for quantitative defect analysis as compared to transmission electron microscope (TEM) based methods. Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</description>

      <title>Holographic hyperbranched polymer nanocomposite grating with exceptionally large neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticle-polymer composite gratings incorporating ultrahigh-refractive-index hyperbranched polymers as organic nanoparticles have demonstrated exceptional light optical properties, yet their potential for neutron diffraction applications remains unexplored. We report on the neutron optical properties of a holographically structured hyperbranched-polymer-dispersed nanocomposite grating at a quasi-monochromatic neutron wavelength of 2 nm. We show that neutron diffraction measurements performed at the SANS-I instrument of the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) reveal exceptionally high neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes. These scattering length density modulation amplitudes are the highest reported to date. Very high neutron diffraction efficiency is expected with the use of thicker uniform gratings and longer neutron wavelengths, with low angular and wavelength selectivity constraints.</description>

      <title>Primary activity measurement of an Am-241 solution using microgram inkjet gravimetry and decay energy spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for radionuclide assay that is spectroscopic with 100 % counting efficiency for alpha decay. Advancing both cryogenic decay energy spectrometry (DES) and drop-on-demand inkjet metrology, a solution of Am-241 was assayed for massic activity (of order 100 kBq/g) with a relative combined standard uncertainty less than 1 %. We implement live-timed counting, spectroscopic analysis, validation by liquid scintillation (LS) counting, and confirmation of quantitative solution transfer. Experimental DES spectra are well modeled with a Monte Carlo simulation. The model was further used to simulate Pu-238 and Pu-240 impurities, calculate detection limits, and demonstrate the potential for tracer-free multi-nuclide analysis, which will be valuable for new cancer therapeutics based on decay chains, Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) containing impurities, and more widely in nuclear energy, environmental monitoring, security, and forensics.</description>

      <title>Annealing behaviour of charge collection of neutron irradiated diodes from 8-inch p-type silicon wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the CE will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 $\rm m^2$. Fluences up to $\rm1.0\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 2 MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of 3 $\rm ab^{-1}$. The whole CE will normally operate at -35{\deg}C in order to mitigate the effects of radiation damage.
  The silicon sensors are processed on novel 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\mu m$, 200 $\mu m$ and 120 $\mu m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor several small sized test structures (e.g pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at the TRIGA reactor in JSI (Jo\v{z}ef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana) to 13 fluences between $\rm6.5\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $\rm1.5\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$.
  The charge collection of the irradiated silicon diodes was determined through transient current technique (TCT) measurements. The study focuses on the isothermal annealing behaviour of the bulk material at 60{\deg}C. The results have been used to extend the usage of thicker silicon sensors in regions expecting higher fluences and are being used to estimate the expected annealing effects of the silicon sensors during year-end technical stops and long HL-LHC shutdowns currently foreseen with a temperature around 0{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Scheme for continuous force detection with a single electron at the level of $10^{-27}\ \mathrm{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of weak forces is a central problem in physics and engineering, ranging in importance from fundamental pursuits such as precision tests of gravity, gravitational-wave detection, and searches for dark matter, to applications such as force microscopy. These pursuits require a low-mass mechanical force transducer with a high quality factor, whose motion can be measured in a quantum-noise-limited manner. Here we study the ultimate example of such a transducer: a single trapped electron. We propose and analyze in detail a new scheme for high-sensitivity continuous force detection using a single trapped electron whose motion is coupled to a microwave cavity field via image currents induced in an antenna. We derive the fundamental and technical limits to the sensitivity of this scheme and show that despite the disparity in size between that of a single electron and the wavelength of the microwave field, it is possible to continuously monitor the charge's zero-point motion and use it as a force detector with a sensitivity as low as $6\times 10^{-27}\ \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the gigahertz regime. This sensitivity improves on the state-of-the-art by four orders of magnitude and thus paves the way to novel precision experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, was a segmented antineutrino detector that successfully operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in Oak Ridge, TN, during its 2018 run. Despite challenges with photomultiplier tube base failures affecting some segments, innovative machine learning approaches were employed to perform position and energy reconstruction, and particle classification. This work highlights the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks and graph convolutional networks in enhancing data analysis. By leveraging these techniques, a 3.3\% increase in effective statistics was achieved compared to traditional methods, showcasing their potential to improve analysis performance. Furthermore, these machine learning methodologies offer promising applications for other segmented particle detectors, underscoring their versatility and impact.</description>
