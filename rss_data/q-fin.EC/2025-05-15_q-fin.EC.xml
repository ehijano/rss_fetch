      <title>Should I Stay or Should I Go Now? An Investigation into Gender Differences in the Impact of Switching Jobs on Earnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between job mobility and earnings growth in the UK labour market, with a focus on gender differences in the returns to switching jobs. Using data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) between 2011 and 2023, the analysis compares wage progression for job switchers and stayers, controlling for individual and job characteristics. The findings show that job mobility is associated with higher earnings growth, but women experience smaller gains than men, with occupational mobility and age further widening this gap. However, the study finds no statistically significant evidence that changes in occupation, sector, or working time pattern influence this gender gap. The results highlight the importance of addressing gender disparities in the returns to job mobility and provide valuable evidence for developing policy interventions aimed at promoting more equitable labour market outcomes.</description>

      <title>An Agent-Based Extension to Sector-Wise Input-Output Recovery Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic input-output models are standard tools for understanding inter-industry dependencies and how economies respond to shocks like disasters and pandemics. However, traditional approaches often assume fixed prices, limiting their ability to capture realistic economic behavior. Here, we introduce an adaptive extension to dynamic input-output recovery models where producers respond to shocks through simultaneous price and quantity adjustments. Our framework preserves the economic constraints of the Leontief input-output model while converging towards equilibrium configurations based on sector-specific behavioral parameters. When applied to input-output data, the model allows us to compute behavioral metrics indicating whether specific sectors predominantly favor price or quantity adjustments. Using the World Input-Output Database, we identify strong, consistent regional and sector-specific behavioral patterns. These findings provide insights into how different regions employ distinct strategies to manage shocks, thereby influencing economic resilience and recovery dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Prior Confidence and Belief Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate how confidence over multiple priors affects belief updating. Theory predicts that the average Bayesian posterior is unaffected by confidence over multiple priors if average priors are the same. We manipulate confidence by varying the time subjects view a black-and-white grid, the proportion representing the prior in a Bernoulli distribution. We find that when subjects view the grid for a longer duration, they have more confidence, under-update more, and place more (less) weight on priors (signals). Overall, confidence over multiple priors matters when it should not, while confidence in prior beliefs does not matter when it should.</description>

      <title>European Defence Readiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparedness and readiness of Europe is currently being challenged not only by Russia, but since recently also by its long-standing allies. In response to the evolving external security environment, the EU's White Paper on European Defence Readiness 2030 outlines the key defence issues in Europe - including critical capability gaps of forces, challenges of the defence industry such as fragmented defence market and military mobility. Leveraging an empirically validated general equilibrium multi-sector model with ambiguity and risk, this study assesses how prepared is Europe to address protracted conflicts and systemic shocks. Exploring what strategies could enhance European readiness, scenario analysis of a hypothetical total trade war imply that today's existing problems will only be amplified by systemic shocks, if not addressed timely and in a targeted way.</description>
