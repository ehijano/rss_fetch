      <title>RAID: In-Network RA Signaling Storm Detection for 5G Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disaggregation and virtualization of 5G Open RAN (O-RAN) introduces new vulnerabilities in the control plane that can greatly impact the quality of service (QoS) of latency-sensitive 5G applications and services. One critical issue is Random Access (RA) signaling storms where, a burst of illegitimate or misbehaving user equipments (UEs) send Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection requests that rapidly saturate a Central Unit's (CU) processing pipeline. Such storms trigger widespread connection failures within the short contention resolution window defined by 3GPP. Existing detection and mitigation approaches based on near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (n-RT RIC) applications cannot guarantee a timely reaction to such attacks as RIC control loops incur tens to hundreds of milliseconds of latency due to the non-deterministic nature of their general purpose processor (GPP) based architectures. This paper presents RAID, an in-network RA signaling storm detection and mitigation system that leverages P4-programmable switch ASICs to enable real-time protection from malicious attacks. RAID embeds a lightweight Random Forest (RF) classifier into a programmable Tofino switch, enabling line-rate flow classification with deterministic microsecond-scale inference delay. By performing ML-based detection directly in the data plane, RAID catches and filters malicious RA requests before they reach and overwhelm the RRC. RAID achieves above 94% detection accuracy with a fixed per-flow inference delay on the order of 3.4 microseconds, effectively meeting strict O-RAN control-plane deadlines. These improvements are sustained across multiple traffic loads, making RAID a fast and scalable solution for the detection and mitigation of signaling storms in 5G O-RAN.</description>

      <title>PLATONT: Learning a Platonic Representation for Unified Network Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network tomography aims to infer hidden network states, such as link performance, traffic load, and topology, from external observations. Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.</description>

      <title>QADR: A Scalable, Quantum-Resistant Protocol for Anonymous Data Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</description>

      <title>Optimum Network Slicing for Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) Services in Campus Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within 3GPP, the campus network architecture has evolved as a deployment option for industries and can be provisioned using network slicing over already installed 5G public network infrastructure. In campus networks, the ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) service category is of major interest for applications with strict latency and high-reliability requirements. One way to achieve high reliability in a shared infrastructure is through resource isolation, whereby network slicing can be optimized to adequately reserve computation and transmission capacity. This paper proposes an approach for vertical slicing the radio access network (RAN) to enable the deployment of multiple and isolated campus networks to accommodate URLLC services. To this end, we model RAN function placement as a mixed integer linear programming problem with URLLC-related constraints. We demonstrate that our approach can find optimal solutions in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, unlike existing solutions, our model considers the user traffic flow from a known source node on the network's edge to an unknown \textit{a priori} destination node. This flexibility could be explored in industrial campus networks by allowing dynamic placement of user plane functions (UPFs) to serve the URLLC.</description>

      <title>Distributed Split Computing Using Diffusive Metrics for UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large-scale UAV swarms, dynamically executing machine learning tasks can pose significant challenges due to network volatility and the heterogeneous resource constraints of each UAV. Traditional approaches often rely on centralized orchestration to partition tasks among nodes. However, these methods struggle with communication bottlenecks, latency, and reliability when the swarm grows or the topology shifts rapidly. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully distributed, diffusive metric-based approach for split computing in UAV swarms. Our solution introduces a new iterative measure, termed the aggregated gigaflops, capturing each node's own computing capacity along with that of its neighbors without requiring global network knowledge. By forwarding partial inferences intelligently to underutilized nodes, we achieve improved task throughput, lower latency, and enhanced energy efficiency. Further, to handle sudden workload surges and rapidly changing node conditions, we incorporate an early-exit mechanism that can adapt the inference pathway on-the-fly. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline strategies across multiple performance indices, including latency, fairness, and energy consumption. These results highlight the feasibility of large-scale distributed intelligence in UAV swarms and provide a blueprint for deploying robust, scalable ML services in diverse aerial networks.</description>

      <title>Flowcut Switching: High-Performance Adaptive Routing with In-Order Delivery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network latency severely impacts the performance of applications running on supercomputers. Adaptive routing algorithms route packets over different available paths to reduce latency and improve network utilization. However, if a switch routes packets belonging to the same network flow on different paths, they might arrive at the destination out-of-order due to differences in the latency of these paths. For some transport protocols like TCP, QUIC, and RoCE, out-of-order (OOO) packets might cause large performance drops or significantly increase CPU utilization. In this work, we propose flowcut switching, a new adaptive routing algorithm that provides high-performance in-order packet delivery. Differently from existing solutions like flowlet switching, which are based on the assumption of bursty traffic and that might still reorder packets, flowcut switching guarantees in-order delivery under any network conditions, and is effective also for non-bursty traffic, as it is often the case for RDMA.</description>

      <title>Permissioned Blockchain in Advanced Air Mobility: A Performance Analysis for UTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into low-altitude airspace has led authorities to adopt distributed Uncrewed Traffic Management (UTM) architectures that ensure interoperability and safety. Blockchain has been proposed as an enabler for trustworthy coordination among UTM stakeholders. Yet, its real-time performance under aeronautical constraints remains insufficiently characterized. This paper presentes a quantitative benchmark comparing two regulation compliant distributed architectures: the federated InterUSS platform maintained by the Linux Foundation and a permissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric. Both systems were evaluated through Operational Intent Reference (OIR) registration work loads generated via Hyperledger Caliper, measuring throughput, latency, and transaction loss under loads up to 50 transactions per second. Results show that InterUSS sustained sub-second latency and stable performance up to 30 TPS. At the same time, Fabric exhibited exponential degradation with median latency exceeding 3 s and tail latencies above 15 s beyond that point. These findings demonstrate that blockchain-based architectures must be redesigned to meet aeronautical timing and scalability requirements, suggesting that hybrid models combining distributed ledgers for auditability with federated frameworks for real-time coordination are more suitable for future UTM deployments.</description>
