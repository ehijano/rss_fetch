      <title>SKdV, SmKdV flows and their supersymmetric gauge-Miura transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Integrable Hierarchies in terms of zero curvature representation provides a systematic construction for a series of integrable non-linear evolution equations (flows) which shares a common affine Lie algebraic structure. The integrable hierarchies are then classified in terms of a decomposition of the underlying affine Lie algebra $\hat \lie $ into graded subspaces defined by a grading operator $Q$. In this paper we shall discuss explicitly the simplest case of the affine $\hat {sl}(2)$ Kac-Moody algebra within the principal gradation given rise to the KdV and mKdV hierarchies and extend to supersymmetric models.
  It is known that the positive mKdV sub-hierachy is associated to some positive odd graded abelian subalgebra with elements denoted by $E^{(2n+1)}$. Each of these elements in turn, defines a time evolution equation according to time $t=t_{2n+1}$. An interesting observation is that for negative grades, the zero curvature representation allows both, even or odd sub-hierarchies. In both cases, the flows are non-local leading to integro-differential equations. Whilst positive and negative odd sub-hierarchies admit zero vacuum solutions, the negative even admits strictly non-zero vacuum solutions. Soliton solutions can be constructed by gauge transforming the zero curvature from the vacuum into a non trivial configuration (dressing method).
  Inspired by the dressing transformation method, we have constructed a gauge-Miura transformation
  mapping mKdV into KdV flows. Interesting new results concerns the negative grade sector of the mKdV hierarchy in which a double degeneracy of flows (odd and its consecutive even) of mKdV are mapped into a single odd KdV flow. These results are extended to supersymmetric hierarchies based upon the affine $\hat {sl}(2,1)$ super-algebra.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for quad equations, tetrahedron equations, and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three novel types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form for the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. Two of our new Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, whereas the third produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations). We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, existing and new, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <title>Quantization of classical spectral curves via topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the topological recursion formalism can be used to quantize any generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at infinity.</description>

      <title>Dual theory of decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recently found \cite{migdal2023exact} reduction of decaying turbulence in the Navier-Stokes equation in $3 + 1$ dimensions to a Number Theory problem of finding the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble. We reformulate the Euler ensemble as a Markov chain and show the equivalence of this formulation to the quantum statistical theory of free fermions on a ring, with an external field related to the random fractions of $\pi$. We find the solution of this system in the statistical limit $N\to \infty$ in terms of a complex trajectory (instanton) providing a saddle point to the path integral over the charge density of these fermions. This results in an analytic formula for the observable correlation function of vorticity in wavevector space. This is a full solution of decaying turbulence from the first principle without assumptions, approximations, or fitted parameters. We compute resulting integrals in \Mathematica{} and present effective indexes for the energy decay as a function of time Fig.\ref{fig::NPlot} and the energy spectrum as a function of the wavevector at fixed time Fig.\ref{fig::SPIndex}. In particular, the asymptotic value of the effective index in energy decay $n(\infty) = \frac{7}{4}$, but the universal function $n(t)$ is neither constant nor linear.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>
