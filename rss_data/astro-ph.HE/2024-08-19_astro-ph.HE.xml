      <title>The formation of black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars is not trivial: Simulations of thermonuclear pulsations and explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation and evolution of rapidly accreting supermassive stars has received significant attention in the hope of better understanding the origin of high redshift quasars. It is often taken for granted that once formed, these supermassive stars will encounter the general relativistic radial instability and collapse to form massive black holes. Here, we present the first ever general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of rapidly accreting supermassive stars. We find that black hole formation is in many cases prevented by nuclear burning due to the long timescales of the collapse of these stars ($10^6$ s). Consequently, this is a novel astrophysical site for hot CNO burning and hydrogen burning via proton captures. For Pop III accreting supermassive stars, we find that only stars with very high (100 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) or low (0.1 $\rm{M_\odot}/$yr) accretion rates can form black holes, with models in between undergoing energetic thermonuclear pulsations. The final fate of these pulsating models may be to undergo subsequent pulsations or explosions or to collapse to black holes. For metal rich accreting supermassive stars ($Z\geq 0.1 \rm{Z_\odot}$), we do not find any black hole formation, with some models undergoing extremely energetic explosions ($10^{55}$ ergs). Our results invite further study on the formation of massive black holes from rapidly accreting supermassive stars which have reached the general relativistic radial instability.</description>

      <title>Outflows from naked singularities, infall through the black hole horizon: hydrodynamic simulations of accretion in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the first simulations of accretion onto the compact objects in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime. The results obtained in general relativity are representative of those for spherically symmetric naked singularities and black holes in a number of modified gravity theories. A possible application of these calculations is to the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with their powerful jets. It is now possible to compare the results of such simulations with the accreting supermassive objects in our own Milky Way and the nearest spiral galaxy: observations of the core regions of galactic nuclei (Sgr A* and M87) performed with unprecedented resolution by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration allow fairly direct tests of the spacetime-metric of the central compact object. In this context we present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulation results of accretion from an orbiting accretion torus (with a cusp) onto a RN black hole and a RN naked singularity. The results could not be more different for the two cases. For a black hole, just as in the familiar Kerr/Schwarzschild case, matter overflowing the cusp plunges into the black hole horizon. For the naked singularity, the accreting matter forms an inner structure of toroidal topology and leaves the system via powerful outflows. It is an open question whether this inner structure can give rise to an image quantitatively similar to the ones reported by EHT for M87 and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Evolution for Keplerian and Sub-Keplerian Flows around Non Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact two-dimensional non-stationary solution for the evolution of the magnetic field during accretion with nearly spherical symmetry, using Newton's solution and considering both Keplerian and sub-Keplerian flows around the black hole (BH), has been derived using the Schwarzschild metric. In this paper, we also discuss the possible origins of large-scale magnetic field production around black holes (BHs). For example, the origin of this strong large-scale magnetic field could be the interstellar medium or a companion star outside the accretion disk, which is drawn in by the accretion plasma and grows over time. The findings show that the uniform magnetic field of a subsonic flow, which is weak at infinity, increases with time and evolves into a quasi-radial field. This is true for both types of flows. We have also observed that the growth of the radial component of the magnetic field is more pronounced in the sub-Keplerian flow than in the Keplerian flow. However, it is worth noting that, for both types of flows, the magnetic field does not reach its saturation value in the regions $r&gt; r_{c}$; instead, the process of strengthening and growing the magnetic field progresses to a point where the disk evolves from its initial condition to a state close to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, forming a sub-MAD state.</description>

      <title>Collisionless tearing instability in a relativistic pair plasma with a power-law distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tearing instability of a current sheet in a relativistic pair plasma with a power law distribution function. We first estimate the growth rate analytically and then confirm the analytical results by solving numerically the dispersion equation, taking into account all exact particle trajectories within the reconnecting layer. We found that the instability is suppressed when the particle spectrum becomes harder.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Wow! I: An Astrophysical Explanation for the Wow! Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ohio State University Big Ear radio telescope detected in 1977 the Wow! Signal, one of the most famous and intriguing signals of extraterrestrial origin. Arecibo Wow! is a new project that aims to find similar signals in archived data from the Arecibo Observatory. From 2017 to 2020, we observed many targets of interest at 1 to 10 GHz with the 305-meter telescope. Here we present our first results of drift scans made between February and May 2020 at 1420 MHz. The methods, frequency, and bandwidth of these observations are similar to those used to detect the Wow! Signal. However, our observations are more sensitive, have better temporal resolution, and include polarization measurements.
  We report the detection of narrowband signals (10 kHz) near the hydrogen line similar to the Wow! Signal, although two-orders of magnitude less intense and in multiple locations. Despite the similarities, these signals are easily identifiable as due to interstellar clouds of cold hydrogen (HI) in the galaxy. We hypothesize that the Wow! Signal was caused by sudden brightening from stimulated emission of the hydrogen line due to a strong transient radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater (SGR). These are very rare events that depend on special conditions and alignments, where these clouds might become much brighter for seconds to minutes. The original source or the cloud might not be detectable, depending on the sensitivity of the telescope. The precise location of the Wow! Signal might be determined by searching for transient radio sources behind the cold hydrogen clouds in the corresponding region.
  Our hypothesis explains all observed properties of the Wow! Signal, proposes a new source of false positives in technosignature searches, and suggests that the Wow! Signal could be the first recorded event of an astronomical maser flare in the hydrogen line.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Classifier to Follow-up High-Redshift GRBs Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense, short-lived bursts of gamma-ray radiation observed up to a high redshift ($z \sim 10$) due to their luminosities. Thus, they can serve as cosmological tools to probe the early Universe. However, we need a large sample of high$-z$ GRBs, currently limited due to the difficulty in securing time at the large aperture Telescopes. Thus, it is painstaking to determine quickly whether a GRB is high$z$ or low$-z$, which hampers the possibility of performing rapid follow-up observations. Previous efforts to distinguish between high$-$ and low$-z$ GRBs using GRB properties and machine learning (ML) have resulted in limited sensitivity. In this study, we aim to improve this classification by employing an ensemble ML method on 251 GRBs with measured redshifts and plateaus observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Incorporating the plateau phase with the prompt emission, we have employed an ensemble of classification methods to enhance the sensitivity unprecedentedly. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various classification methods using different redshift thresholds, $z_{threshold}$=$z_t$ at $z_{t}=$ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5. We achieve a sensitivity of 87\% and 89\% with a balanced sampling for both $z_{t}=3.0$ and $z_{t}=3.5$, respectively, representing a 9\% and 11\% increase in the sensitivity over Random Forest used alone. Overall, the best results are at $z_{t} = 3.5$, where the difference between the sensitivity of the training set and the test set is the smallest. This enhancement of the proposed method paves the way for new and intriguing follow-up observations of high$-z$ GRBs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the propagation of highly-energetic gamma rays in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent gamma-ray observations have detected photons up to energies of a few PeV. These highly energetic gamma rays are emitted by the most powerful sources in the Galaxy. Propagating over astrophysical distances, gamma rays might interact with background photons producing electron-positron pairs, then deflected by astrophysical magnetic fields. In turn, these charged particles might scatter through inverse Compton galactic radiation fields, triggering electromagnetic cascades. In this scenario, the characterisation of astrophysical environment in which gamma rays travel, specifically background photons and magnetic fields, is crucial. We explore the impact of propagation effects on observables at Earth by simulating galactic sources emitting gamma rays with energy between $100 \; \text{GeV}$ and $100 \; \text{PeV}$. We analyse the imprint of the galactic environment on observed energy spectra and arrival direction maps, revealing gamma-ray absorption features in the former and ``deflection" of gamma rays in the latter. Specifically, owing to interstellar radiation field spatial distribution and the galactic magnetic field structure, propagation effects on observables are found to be related to the specific gamma-ray source position and to the prompt emission model. Detailed investigations of the propagation effect on galactic gamma rays will improve the robustness of both current and future gamma-ray detections and indirect dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Reality of Inverse Cascading in Neutron Star Crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain - with its extreme aspect ratio - requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this extreme aspect ratio limits the inverse cascade to magnetic field structures on scales comparable to the neutron star's crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite this limitation, the inverse cascade can significantly impact the magnetic field evolution in the interior of the crust, potentially explaining the observed characteristics of highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars or central compact objects.</description>

      <title>The unusual events in X-ray emulsion chamber experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article considers events recorded in an experiment with X-ray emulsion chambers (XREC) to study the trunks of extensive air showers (EAS) with energies of nuclei of primary cosmic radiation (PCR) E0 &gt; 100 TeV, which currently have no explanation within the standard model of nuclear interactions (SM). The XREC method is the only one that allows studying EAS trunks with a high coordinate resolution of about 100 microns. EAS trunks contain the most complete information about primary acts of nuclear interactions, as a result of which all unusual events recorded by the XREC method are of great scientific interest. Several types of unusual events recorded by the XREC method were explained within the SM.</description>

      <title>Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the big bang nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. Resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with s-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with p-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the supernova Ia hypervelocity runaway white dwarf J0927-6335</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot white dwarf (WD) J0927-6335 (Gaia DR3 5250394728194220800, effective temperature T$_{\rm eff}$ = 60,000 K, surface gravity log g = 7) was detected as the fastest known Galactic hypervelocity star with a space velocity of $\approx$2800 km s$^{-1}$ and an atmosphere dominated by carbon and oxygen. It is thought to be the surviving WD donor predicted by the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D$^6$) type Ia supernova formation model. We analysed an ultraviolet spectrum of J0927-6335 obtained recently with the Hubble Space Telescope and found very high abundances of iron and nickel. This could originate in the pollution of the remnant by the SN Ia explosion but it is uncertain to what extent atomic diffusion altered the chemical composition of the accreted material.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hyperluminous quasar at z = 1.62 with Eddington ratio &gt; 3 in the eFEDS field confirmed by KOOLS-IFU on Seimei Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a hyperluminous type 1 quasar (eFEDS J082826.9-013911; eFEDSJ0828-0139) at $z_{\rm spec}$ = 1.622 with a super-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We perform the optical spectroscopic observations with KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope. The black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) based on the single-epoch method with MgII $\lambda$2798 is estimated to be $M_{\rm BH} = (6.2 \pm 1.2) \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$. To measure the precise infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$), we obtain submillimeter data taken by SCUBA-2 on JCMT and conduct the spectral energy distribution analysis with X-ray to submillimeter data. We find that $L_{\rm IR}$ of eFEDSJ0828-0139 is $L_{\rm IR} = (6.8 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{13}$ $L_{\odot}$, confirming the existence of a hypeluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG). $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is estimated to be $\lambda_{\rm Edd} = 3.6 \pm 0.7$, making it one of the quasars with the highest BH mass accretion rate at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Rotation of Polarization Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase$-$\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}. The Influence of The Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to the light curve and energy spectrum, polarization is also important for inferring the physical properties of the Gamma-ray burst (GRB). Rotation of the polarization angle (PA) with time will cause depolarization of the time-integrated polarization degree. However, it is rarely studied before. Here, we use a magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale ordered aligned magnetic field in the emitting region to study the influence of the parameters on the PA rotations in GRB prompt phase. We find that half-opening angle of the jet $\theta_{j}$, the observational angle $\theta_{V}$, and the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ all have significant impacts on the PA rotations. The PA rotations are affected by the product value of $\theta_{j}\Gamma_{0}$ ($\Gamma_{0}$ is the normalization factor of $\Gamma$ with $\Gamma(r)=\Gamma_{0}(r/r_{0})^{s}$), but are roughly independent of the concrete values of both $\theta_{j}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$. For the typical parameters, the changes of the PA within $T_{90}$ ($\triangle$PA) would be within ($12^\circ$, $66^\circ$) for slight off-axis observations, where $T_{90}$ is the duration of the burst with the accumulated flux density ranging from $5\%$ to $95\%$. The $q$ range for $\triangle$PA$&gt;10^{\circ}$ becomes smaller with the increase of the product value of $\theta_{j}\Gamma_{0}$. The most significant PA rotation with $\triangle$PA$\sim90^{\circ}$ will happen when $\theta_{j}\Gamma_{0}&gt;50$ and $1.0&lt;q\leq1.2$.</description>

      <title>Relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission of GRB 221009A and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to launch relativistic jets, which generate prompt emission by internal processes, and produce long-lasting afterglows by driving external shocks into surrounding medium. However, how the jet powers the external shock is poorly known. The unprecedented observations of the keV-MeV emission with GECAM and the TeV emission with LHAASO of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A offer a great opportunity to study the prompt-to-afterglow transition and the impact of jet on the early dynamics of external shock. In this letter, we find that the cumulative light curve of keV-MeV emission could well fit the rising stage of the TeV light curve of GRB 221009A, with a time delay, $4.45^{+0.26}_{-0.26}$\,s, of TeV emission. Moreover, both the rapid increase in the initial stage and the excess from about \T+260\,s to 270\,s in the TeV light curve are tracking the light-curve bumps in the prompt keV-MeV emission. The close relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission reveals the continuous energy-injection into the external shock. Assuming an energy-injection rate exactly following the keV-MeV flux of GRB 221009A, including the very early precursor, we build a continuous energy-injection model where the jet Lorentz factor is derived from the TeV time delay, and the TeV data is well fitted, with the TeV excesses interpreted by inverse Compton (IC) scatterings of the inner-coming prompt emission by the energetic electrons in external shock.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Objects May Be Closer Than They Appear: Significant Host Galaxy Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts in Zoom-in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of host galaxies to the overall Dispersion Measures (DMs) for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite. We calculate DMs from every star particle in the simulated L* galaxies by ray-tracing through their multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), summing the line-of-sight free thermal electron column for all gas elements within $\pm$20 kpc of the galactic mid-plane. At $z=0$, we find average (median) host-galaxy DMs of 74 (43) and 210 (94) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. Inclination raises the median DM measured for older populations ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) in the simulations by a factor of $\sim$2, but generally does not affect the younger stars deeply embedded in H{\small II} regions except in extreme edge-on cases (inclination $\gtrsim 85^\circ$). In kinematically disturbed snapshots ($z = 1$ in FIRE), the average (median) host-galaxy DMs are higher: 80 (107) and 266 (795) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. FIRE galaxies tend to have higher DM values than cosmological simulations such as IllustrisTNG\rev{, with larger tails in their distributions to high DMs}. As a result, FRB host galaxies may be closer (lower redshift) than previously inferred. Furthermore, constraining host-galaxy DM distributions may help significantly constrain FRB progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Proton and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The results of simulations of magnetic reconnection accompanied by electron and proton heating and energization in a macroscale system are presented. Both species form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades in energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal particles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux ropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the protons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to higher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low energy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons compared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of non-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares, proton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies that can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry much more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct observations.</description>
