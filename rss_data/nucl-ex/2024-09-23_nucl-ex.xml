      <title>Can charm fluctuation be a better probe to study QCD critical point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion properties of an interacting hadron gas and evaluate the diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon, strange, electric, and charm quantum numbers. For the first time, this study sheds light on the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for the charmed states by treating them as a part of the quasi-thermalized medium. We explore the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy. A van der Waals-like interaction is assumed between the hadrons, including attractive and repulsive interactions. The calculation of diffusion coefficients is based on relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation. A good agreement with available model calculations is observed in the hadronic limit. To conclude the study, we discuss, with a detailed explanation, that charm fluctuation is expected to be a better tool for probing the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Design and development of an advanced material for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-flavor, strange-flavor particles, and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Utilizing the Thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive of light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We have determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$7.7-200 GeV and four centralities. A significant finding was a decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ upon the inclusion of light nuclei, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This indicates that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal the presence of at least three distinct freeze-out hyper-surfaces at RHIC energies, corresponding to different chemical freeze-out temperatures: a light flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$=150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$=165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$=141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed. Instead, the chemical freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light flavor hadrons. This discrepancy may suggest different production mechanisms for light nuclei between RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>First combined tuning on transverse kinematic imbalance data with and without pion production constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first combined tuning, using GENIE, of four transverse kinematic imbalance measurements of neutrino-hydrocarbon scattering, both with and without pion final states, from the T2K and MINERvA experiments. As a proof of concept, we have simultaneously tuned the initial state and final-state interaction models (SF-CFG and hA, respectively), producing a new effective model that more accurately describes the data.</description>
