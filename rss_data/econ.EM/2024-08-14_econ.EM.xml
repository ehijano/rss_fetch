      <title>An unbounded intensity model for point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model for point processes on the real line, where the intensity can be locally unbounded without inducing an explosion. In contrast to an orderly point process, for which the probability of observing more than one event over a short time interval is negligible, the bursting intensity causes an extreme clustering of events around the singularity. We propose a nonparametric approach to detect such bursts in the intensity. It relies on a heavy traffic condition, which admits inference for point processes over a finite time interval. With Monte Carlo evidence, we show that our testing procedure exhibits size control under the null, whereas it has high rejection rates under the alternative. We implement our approach on high-frequency data for the EUR/USD spot exchange rate, where the test statistic captures abnormal surges in trading activity. We detect a nontrivial amount of intensity bursts in these data and describe their basic properties. Trading activity during an intensity burst is positively related to volatility, illiquidity, and the probability of observing a drift burst. The latter effect is reinforced if the order flow is imbalanced or the price elasticity of the limit order book is large.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Inference of Average Treatment Effect in Percentage Points under Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-log regression models with heterogeneous treatment effects, the average treatment effect (ATE) in log points and its exponential transformation minus one underestimate the ATE in percentage points. I propose new estimation and inference methods for the ATE in percentage points, with inference utilizing the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation. These methods are particularly relevant for staggered difference-in-differences designs, where treatment effects often vary across groups and periods. I prove the methods' large-sample properties and demonstrate their finite-sample performance through simulations, revealing substantial discrepancies between conventional and proposed measures. Two empirical applications further underscore the practical importance of these methods.</description>

      <title>Endogeneity Corrections in Binary Outcome Models with Nonlinear Transformations: Identification and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For binary outcome models, an endogeneity correction based on nonlinear rank-based transformations is proposed. Identification without external instruments is achieved under one of two assumptions: Either the endogenous regressor is a nonlinear function of one component of the error term conditionally on exogenous regressors. Or the dependence between endogenous regressor and exogenous regressor is nonlinear. Under these conditions, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality. Monte Carlo simulations and an application on German insolvency data illustrate the usefulness of the method.</description>

      <title>Two-way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences Estimators in Heterogeneous Adoption Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation under a parallel trends assumption, in designs where no unit is treated at period one, all units receive a strictly positive dose at period two, and the dose varies across units. There are therefore no true control groups in such cases. First, we develop a test of the assumption that the treatment effect is mean independent of the treatment, under which the commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects estimator is consistent. When this test is rejected or lacks power, we propose alternative estimators, robust to heterogeneous effects. If there are units with a period-two treatment arbitrarily close to zero, the robust estimator is a difference-in-difference using units with a period-two treatment below a bandwidth as controls. Without such units, we propose non-parametric bounds, and an estimator relying on a parametric specification of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We use our results to revisit Pierce and Schott (2016) and Enikolopov et al. (2011).</description>
