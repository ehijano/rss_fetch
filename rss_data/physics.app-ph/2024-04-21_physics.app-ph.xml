      <title>Analysis of the Annealing Budget of Metal Oxide Thin-Film Transistors Prepared by an Aqueous Blade-Coating Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal oxide (MO) semiconductors are widely used in electronic devices due to their high optical transmittance and promising electrical performance. This work describes the advancement toward an eco-friendly, streamlined method for preparing thin-film transistors (TFTs) via a pure water-solution blade-coating process with focus on a low thermal budget. Low temperature and rapid annealing of triple-coated indium oxide thin-film transistors (3C-TFTs) and indium oxide/zinc oxide/indium oxide thin-film transistors (IZI-TFTs) on a 300 nm SiO2 gate dielectric at 300 $^{\circ}$C for only 60 s yields devices with an average field effect mobility of 10.7 and 13.8 cm2/Vs, respectively. The devices show an excellent on/off ratio (&gt;10^6), and a threshold voltage close to 0 V when measured in air. Flexible MO-TFTs on polyimide substrates with AlOx dielectrics fabricated by rapid annealing treatment can achieve a remarkable mobility of over 10 cm2/Vs at low operating voltage. When using a longer post-coating annealing period of 20 min, high-performance 3C-TFTs (over 18 cm2/Vs) and IZI-TFTs (over 38 cm2/Vs) using MO semiconductor layers annealed at 300 $^{\circ}$C are achieved.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Structure Formation in Highly Oriented Triple Cation Perovskite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites are an emerging class of crystalline semiconductors of great interest for application in optoelectronics. Their properties are dictated not only by their composition, but also by their crystalline structure and microstructure. While significant efforts were dedicated to the development of strategies for microstructural control, significantly less is known about the processes that govern the formation of their crystalline structure in thin films, in particular in the context of crystalline orientation. In this work, we investigate the formation of highly oriented triple cation perovskite films fabricated by utilizing a range of alcohols as an antisolvent. Examining the film formation by in-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering reveals the presence of a short-lived highly oriented crystalline intermediate, which we identify as FAI-PbI2-xDMSO. The intermediate phase templates the crystallisation of the perovskite layer, resulting in highly oriented perovskite layers. The formation of this DMSO containing intermediate is triggered by the selective removal of DMF when alcohols are used as an antisolvent, consequently leading to differing degrees of orientation depending on the antisolvent properties. Finally, we demonstrate that photovoltaic devices fabricated from the highly oriented films, are superior to those with a random polycrystalline structure in terms of both performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer mechanism on MoS$_2$ nanosheets in the presence of a semiconductor photoactive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) coupled with photoactive particles, plasmonic nanocavities, waveguides, and metamaterials remain in their infancy. This study investigates the third-order NLO properties of MoS$_2$ nanosheets in the presence of a semiconductor photoactive medium. Our extensive studies and the obtained results reveal the counteractive coupling effect of bare and passivated quantum dots on the MoS$_2$ nanosheet, as made evident by the analysis of the NLO processes. The enhanced NLO properties of MoS$_2$ nanosheets functionalized with CdSe and CdSe-V2O5 quantum dots are helpful for applications as saturable absorbers in laser applications and the emission of coherent short-wavelength radiation. The multiphoton-excitation resonance energy transfer mechanism exploiting remote dipole dipole coupling, and ultrafast charge transfer pathways emerges as another plausible way to alter the NLO properties in TMDs.</description>

      <title>In-tube micro-pyramidal silicon nanopore for inertial-kinetic sensing of single molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrokinetic force has been the major choice for driving the translocation of molecules through a nanopore. However, the use of this approach is limited by an uncontrollable translocation speed, resulting in non-uniform conductance signals with low conformational sensitivity, which hinders the accurate discrimination of the molecules. Here, we show the first use of inertial-kinetic translocation induced by spinning an in-tube micro-pyramidal silicon nanopore fabricated using photovoltaic electrochemical etch-stop technique for biomolecular sensing. By adjusting the kinetic properties of a funnel-shaped centrifugal force field while maintaining a counter-balanced state of electrophoretic and electroosmotic effect in the nanopore, we achieved regulated translocation of proteins and obtained stable signals of long and adjustable dwell times and high conformational sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrated instantaneous sensing and discrimination of molecular conformations and longitudinal monitoring of molecular reactions and conformation changes by wirelessly measuring characteristic features in current blockade readouts using the in-tube nanopore device.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Process for Integration of Organic Electrochemical Transistors for High Uniformity &amp; Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photolithography is believed to be a complementary technique to large-area printing, allowing for nanometer-scale integration and offering cost-efficiency. For organic electronics though, adapting photolithography is very challenging due to chemical incompatibilities. However, with the help of Alexander Zakhidov, orthogonal resins opened up the prospect of adapting the well-established process of photolithography for organic electronics. Here, we present a hybrid fabrication method for organic electrochemical transistors by combining orthogonal photolithography and inkjet printing, enabling high uniformity and reliability. We demonstrate how the resolution of each process affects the uniformity, and we explore the advantages of this process for device scaling and circuit integration.</description>

Abstract: We report our progress in the high-temperature superconductor (HTS) Josephson junction fabrication process founded on using a focused helium ion beam damaging technique and discuss the expected device performance attainable with the HTS multi-junction device technology. Both the achievable high value of characteristic voltage $V_c=I_cR_N$ of Josephson junctions and the ability to design a large number of arbitrary located Josephson junctions allow narrowing the existing gap in design abilities for LTS and HTS circuits even with using a single YBCO film layer. A one-layer topology of active electrically small antenna is suggested and its voltage response characteristics are considered.</description>

      <title>Tribo-piezoelectric Nanogenerators for Energy Harvesting: a first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly promising candidates for various applications due to their unique electrical, optical, mechanical, and chemical properties. Furthermore, heterostructures consisting of TMDs with metals, oxides, and conductive materials have attracted significant research interest due to their exceptional electronic properties. In this study, we utilized density functional theory to investigate those electronic and transport properties, which are relevant for the application of tribo-piezoelectricity in creating novel nanogenerators: an interdisciplinary approach with promising implications. The results of the study demonstrate that the enhancement of charge transfer between layers and the orbital contribution to the Fermi level under applied strain in MoS/IrO, MoS/TiO, MoS/WTe, and MoTe/WS heterostructures is noteworthy. Additionally, non-equilibrium Green's function calculations of electron transport properties provide valuable insights into the behavior of these materials under different conditions. While MoS/IrO and MoS/TiO hetero-bilayers are unsuitable due to their tendency to exhibit large current flow with increasing voltage, others like MoS/WTe and MoTe/WS hetero bilayers show promise due to their ability to prevent voltage drop. The presented innovative concept of utilizing compressive strain of TMD bilayers to generate a tribo-piezoelectric effect for nanogenerators has a potential to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and the measurement of a periodic metasurface that performs anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the behaviour, in terms of RCS, of such a metasurface. This work will therefore focus the discussion on fabrication and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. The measurement results are extensively discussed as well, enlightening some limitations in the context of metasurface RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface indeed performs the anticipated reduction of the RCS level in the considered Floquet direction. The well-agreeing simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with its lower refractive index compared to the mostly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials can exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport properties. Still, their applications in spintronic devices are restricted as they require the growth of high-quality thin films with bulk-like properties. Here, we study 10--30 nm thick epitaxial ferromagnetic Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa films with high structural order and very high values of the anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm xy}=1.35\times10^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$ and the anomalous Hall angle, $\theta_{\rm H}=15.8\%$, both comparable to bulk values. We observe a dramatic crystalline orientation dependence of the Gilbert damping constant of a factor of two and a giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, $\mathit{\sigma_{\rm SHC}}=(6.08\pm 0.02)\times 10^{5}$ ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than literature values of multilayer Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa stacks [1-3] and single-layer Ni, Co, Fe [4], and Ni$_{\rm 80}$Fe$_{\rm 20}$~[4,5]. As a consequence, spin-orbit-torque driven auto-oscillations of a 30 nm thick magnetic film are observed for the first time, at an ultralow threshold current density of $J_{th}=6.2\times10^{11}$ $Am^{-2}$. Theoretical calculations of the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, originating from a strong Berry curvature, corroborate the results and yield values comparable to the experiment. Our results open up for the design of spintronic devices based on single layers of magnetic topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Response of premixed Jet Flames to Blast Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the response dynamics of premixed jet flames when incident with blast waves along the jet axis. In the present work, blast waves are generated using the wire-explosion technique. The generated blast wave interacts with premixed jet flames that are stabilised over a thin fuel-air jet nozzle. The study is performed over a wide range of parametric space, varying the Reynolds number ($Re$) and normalised equivalence ratio ($\Phi$) of the premixed jet and the strength of the generated blast fronts ($M_{s,r}$). The blast wave imposes a decaying flow field profile characterised by a sharp discontinuity at the blast front. This is accompanied by a subsequent induced flow arising due to entertainment from the surroundings as the blast-imposed flow fields decay to sub-ambient levels. While the jet flame is observed to respond to the blast front with a jittery motion, it is found to lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Depending on the operating conditions ($Re$, $\Phi$, and $M_{s,r}$), the flame lift-off is followed by an extinction or a re-attachment event. The flame response is further classified into two re-attachment and three extinction sub-regimes based on the response dynamics of the flame base and flame tip following the interaction process. The flame response entails flame base lift-off and flame tip distortion, potentially leading to a flame pinch-off event contingent on the operating conditions. A mathematical model was developed to explain the flame base response dynamics, yielding a scaling law for flame base lift-off height. Flame tip response trends were elucidated by extending the vorticity transport equation to estimate the vortex roll-up rate in the shear boundary surrounding the flame. Flame pinch-off was observed when shear layer vortices reached critical circulation limits and shed at length scales lower than the flame height.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Tailored Radiation Pattern of Nanoparticles for Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Asymmetric Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces are promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices.Tunable and multimodal SLRs further enhance their appeal for flexible and multi-wavelength light-matter interactions. While multimodal SLRs offer promising properties, their realization often requires sophisticated designs, leading to limited tunability. Furthermore, current high-Q SLR implementations necessitate a homogeneous index in the operational environment, restricting potential applications such as biosensors that are typically operated in an aqueous or air cladding on a substrate. Here we present guided-SLRs (gSLRs) that are easily accessible in index-discontinuous environments, offering multimodal properties and straightforward tunability of resonances wavelengths, mode number, and mode coupling strengths. The gSLRs are achieved by coupling scattered light from metasurface units into a slab waveguide, creating a light ropagating channel in the lattice plane within an index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring the radiation pattern of individual units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances in both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily controlled by adjusting the waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical positions of lattices in the slab. Multimodal gSLRs with strong intensities and tunable ositions extending from visible to near-infrared range are achieved when compose metasurfaces with gold nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities. This easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous mediums will advance the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The efforts of this Note are aimed at understanding various phenomena in digital space that are incomplete and difficult to define, and to translate them into language from research fields that are based on existing large-scale experimental data. Information diffusion and user behavior patterns in digital space are often hard to intuitively capture, and the principles and mechanisms behind them are difficult to articulate. To address this challenge, we have drawn on first-principles methods in physics, particularly solid state physics. This approach is known to be effective in analyzing the behavior of real physical materials at the atomic level and in understanding the electronic properties and bonding structures of materials. We have attempted to apply physical concepts based on first-principles calculations, in particular concepts such as first Brillouin zones, band gaps, and reciprocal lattice vectors, to digital space as a metaphor. This theoretical framework allows us to quantitatively and logically infer the behavior and trends of incomplete and ambiguous digital data and phenomena. For example, the "first Brillouin zone" of information in digital media indicates the potential sphere of influence of that information, and the band gap defines the threshold of influence for the information to be widely accepted. In addition, the reciprocal lattice vector serves as a boundary that indicates the limits of information characteristics and is an indicator of the degree to which a particular piece of information resonates with users. With this theoretical supplement, our research goes beyond the mere analysis of phenomena in the digital space and provides new methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of imperfect data and uncertain digital media.</description>
