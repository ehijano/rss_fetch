      <title>Geoff: The Generic Optimization Framework &amp; Frontend for Particle Accelerator Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geoff is a collection of Python packages that form a framework for automation of particle accelerator controls. With particle accelerator laboratories around the world researching machine learning techniques to improve accelerator performance and uptime, a multitude of approaches and algorithms have emerged. The purpose of Geoff is to harmonize these approaches and to minimize friction when comparing or migrating between them. It provides standardized interfaces for optimization problems, utility functions to speed up development, and a reference GUI application that ties everything together. Geoff is an open-source library developed at CERN and maintained and updated in collaboration between CERN and GSI as part of the EURO-LABS project. This paper gives an overview over Geoff's design, features, and current usage.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design Report of Super Tau-Charm Facility: The Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&amp;D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.</description>
