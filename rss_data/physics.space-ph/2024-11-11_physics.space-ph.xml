      <title>Plasma Seismology: Fully Exploiting the Information Contained in Velocity Space of Kinetic Plasmas using the Morrison G Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly collisional plasmas contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of the plasma in the particle velocity distribution functions, yet our ability to exploit fully that information remains relatively primitive. Here we aim to present the fundamentals of a new technique denoted Plasma Seismology that aims to invert the information from measurements of the particle velocity distribution functions at a single point in space over time to enable the determination of the electric field variation over an extended spatial region. The fundamental mathematical tool at the heart of this technique is the Morrison $G$ Transform. Using kinetic numerical simulations of Langmuir waves in a Vlasov-Poisson plasma, we demonstrate the application of the standard Morrison $G$ Transform, which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function over all space at one time to predict the evolution of the electric field in time. Next, we introduce a modified Morrison $G$ Transform which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function at one point in space over time to determine the spatial variation of the electric field over an extended spatial region. We discuss the limitations of this approach, particularly for the numerically challenging case of Langmuir waves. The application of this technique to Alfven waves in a magnetized plasma holds the promise to apply the technique to existing spacecraft particle measurement instrumentation to determine the electric fields over an extended spatial region away from the spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>
