      <title>Homeostasis in Input-Output Networks: Structure, Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis on Multi-Scale Bioprocess Stochastic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pressing challenges in the digital twin development for biomanufacturing process, we introduce an adjoint sensitivity analysis (SA) approach to expedite the learning of mechanistic model parameters. In this paper, we consider enzymatic stochastic reaction networks representing a multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model that allows us to integrate disparate data from diverse production processes and leverage the information from existing macro-kinetic and genome-scale models. To support forward prediction and backward reasoning, we develop a convergent adjoint SA algorithm studying how the perturbations of model parameters and inputs (e.g., initial state) propagate through enzymatic reaction networks and impact on output trajectory predictions. This SA can provide a sample efficient and interpretable way to assess the sensitivities between inputs and outputs accounting for their causal dependencies. Our empirical study underscores the resilience of these sensitivities and illuminates a deeper comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms behind bioprocess through sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium and nonlinear kinetics as key determinants for bistability in fission yeast G2-M transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A living cell is an open, nonequilibrium biochemical system where ATP hydrolysis serves as the energy source for a wide range of intracellular processes, possibly including the assurance for decision-making. In the fission yeast cell cycle, the transition from G2 to M phase is driven by the activation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25 and the deactivation of Wee1 through phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles with feedback loops. Here, we present a kinetic description of the G2-M circuit which reveals that both cellular ATP level and ATP hydrolysis free energy critically control Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we experimentally verify that increased ATP level drives the activation of Cdc2 which exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to changes in cellular ATP level and ATP hydrolysis energy. These findings suggest that cellular ATP level and ATP hydrolysis energy are determinants of the bistability and robustness of Cdc2 activation during G2-M transition.</description>
