      <title>Curve-Fitting to resolve overlapping voltammetric peaks: Model and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model is presented that is applicable to a wide range of peak-shaped voltammetric signals. It may be used, via curve-fitting, to resolve severely overlapped peaks, irrespective of the degree(s) of reversibility of the electrode processes. The resolution procedure has been thoroughly tested for several voltammetric and polarographic techniques (differential pulse, square wave and pseudo-derivative normal pulse), using reversible, quasireversible and irreversible electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>MAD-SURF: a machine learning interatomic potential for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>

      <title>Toward Tunable Magnetic Dirac Semimetals: Mn Doping of Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities provide a route toward increasing functionality in electronic materials, often enabling new device concepts and architectures. In the case of topological semimetals, dilute magnetic doping presents a particularly attractive approach for inducing a Dirac to Weyl phase change via time reversal symmetry breaking. However, efforts to realize changes in the electronic structure have been limited by challenges in incorporating magnetic impurities into crystals with sufficiently high electron mobilities to detect them via transport or spectroscopic techniques. Here, we demonstrate incorporation of Mn into Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Using As-rich growth conditions and [001] oriented thin films, Mn compositions of &gt;10% are achieved. Films contain uniform distributions of Mn with no evidence of secondary phases and exhibit electron mobilities greater than 10,000-30,000 cm$^2$/Vs up to 5% Mn. An evolution in the magnetization behavior along with the emergence of a second quantum oscillation frequency at low Mn concentrations provide preliminary evidence of Mn-induced changes in the electronic structure that are consistent with a Weyl phase. This work demonstrates the potential of magnetically doping topological semimetal thin films and a pathway for synthesizing them.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</description>

      <title>Light-Emitting Diodes with Micrometer-Thick Perovskite Charge Transport Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, thin-film optoelectronic devices have shown significant advancements. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on organic materials, polymers, quantum dots, as well as metal halide perovskites have achieved remarkable efficiencies and long lifetimes, making them ideal for applications in full-color displays and solid-state lighting. These devices typically feature a layered structure, with the light-emitting layer positioned between charge transport layers and two electrodes. This perspective reviews recent progress in LEDs utilizing perovskite charge transport layers and suggests potential pathways for further development in this field.</description>

      <title>C2NP: A Benchmark for Learning Scale-Dependent Geometric Invariances in 3D Materials Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for materials have achieved strong performance on periodic bulk crystals, yet their ability to generalize across scale transitions to finite nanostructures remains largely untested. We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/C2NP.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spin-split Fermi surfaces in CrSb revealed by quantum oscillation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a class of collinear magnets defined by their spin-split electronic bands, are a focus of intense research, where a key challenge is to experimentally verify this unique band structure as a bulk property. Here, we report a comprehensive quantum oscillation study on the prototypical altermagnet CrSb. By combining high-field magnetotransport and torque measurements with DFT+$U$ calculations including spin-orbit coupling, we successfully identify a multitude of quantum-oscillation frequencies originating from four spin-non-degenerate bands. These results provide definitive, bulk-sensitive evidence for the altermagnetic spin-split Fermi surface of CrSb, which provides a firm foundation for exploring its novel electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Electronic Structure of Strongly Charged Domain Walls in van der Waals {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we use atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first principles calculations to study the atomic and electronic structure of strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$. STEM imaging and density functional theory (DFT) show that head-to-head (HH) domain walls contain a layer of nonpolar $\beta$-In$_2$Se$_3$, whereas tail-to-tail (TT) domain walls are atomically abrupt. We apply 4D STEM and multislice electron ptychography to map ferroelectric domains in 2D and 3D, showing that nearly $180^\circ$ domain walls exhibit complex, curved 3D structures that differ from ideal $180^\circ$ structures. Band structure calculations show localized conducting states within a $\sim$ 1 nm thick layer at both HH and TT domain walls, such as a midgap state at the $\beta$ layer of the HH domain wall. These properties make strongly charged domain walls in $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ excellent candidates for realizing 2D electron or hole gases and domain wall engineering in van der Waals ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Mapping Metastable Magnetic Textures in (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 with in-situ Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic textures are a promising route to low-energy control of magnetism, but they are most often studied away from ambient conditions, typically at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Here we use in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy with control of temperature and magnetic field to investigate the skyrmion metastability in (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT). By field-cooling FCGT in magnetic fields of different magnitude to different base temperatures and then removing the applied field, we create meta(stable) zero-field magnetic states. We use this method to build a phase diagram of the zero-field metastable spin structures in FCGT, which will be critical for selecting the desired topologically-protected spin state for future studies to manipulate magnetism with stimuli such as electric current, electric field, mechanical strain, and more.</description>

      <title>Site preference of chalcogen atoms in 1T$^\prime$ $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ ($M=$ Mo and W; $X, Y=$ S, Se, and Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulator-metal transition, accompanying the structural phase transition from 2H to 1T$^\prime$ structure, has been reported in two-dimensional W-S-Te and W-Se-Te systems. It is also reported that Te atoms tend to occupy a specific site of the 1T$^\prime$ structure. Here, we study the site preference of chalcogen atoms in $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ ($M=$ Mo and W; $X, Y=$ S, Se, and Te; $0\le x \le 1$) using first-principles approach. We demonstrate that the site preference of chalcogen atoms explains the universal correlation between the formation energy and the Peierls-like distortion amplitude in the 1T$^\prime$ phase. The impact of the site preference on the linear elastic properties is strong, whereas its impact is weak in the non-linear regime. This establishes the structure-property relationships in $MX_{2(1-x)}Y_{2x}$ systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Adapted Analysis of Screw Dislocation: Electronic Structure and Carrier Recombination Mechanisms in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fundamental one-dimensional defects, screw dislocations profoundly reshape the energy landscape and carrier dynamics of crystalline materials. By restoring the exact algebra of the screw dislocation group, we unveil the latent symmetry constraints that govern the electronic structure, providing a more rigorous physical picture than the conventional treatments. When applied to GaN, the method yields a band-connectivity constraint and rigorous dipole selection rules for polarization-resolved transitions. Combined with computed Hamiltonian matrix, the approach gives symmetry-filtered radiative and dielectric calculations and reveals a piezoelectrical effect at the dislocation core that strongly suppresses radiative recombination. The pronounced dominance of non-radiative capture over radiative recombination highlights the detrimental impact of screw dislocations on the luminous efficiency of GaN, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing dislocation-limited optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mapping optical, chemical, structural features in ZrO2 via cross-sectional SEM-Cathodoluminescence correlation microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation.</description>

      <title>Charge redistribution at metal-ZrO2 interfaces: A combined DFT and continuum electrostatic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic inclusions (NMIs) are commonly observed within oxide scales formed during high-temperature oxidation, revealing the existence of chemical and electronic heterogeneity beyond conventional corrosion theories that assume homogeneous, fully oxidized films. Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs.</description>

      <title>Graphene Nanoribbon-Graphdiyne Lateral Heterojunctions with Atomically Abrupt Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-based 2D heterostructures represent an attractive platform for nanoelectronics owing to their tunable electronic and transport properties, yet achieving precise control over their fabrication remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the on--surface synthesis of covalently bonded lateral heterostructures between armchair graphene nanoribbons and metalated hydrogenated graphdiyne networks on Au(111). Atomic--resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy combined with density functional theory reveals the formation mechanism of covalent interfacial bonds and highlights the critical influence of surface chemistry. In particular, chemisorbed bromine atoms suppress junction formation, while controlled atomic hydrogen dosing increases the bonding efficiency to 71\%. Electronic structure and transport calculations demonstrate how the metallic substrate influences the supported heterostructure, whereas in the freestanding limit, the two carbon subsystems retain their intrinsic properties, forming an atomically narrow junction that enables voltage-tunable spatial current separation. These results define a viable strategy for engineering graphene--graphdiyne heterostructures and advance the design of all-carbon nanoscale electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>Si-Ga2O3/p-GaN epitaxial heterostructure based self-powered and visible-blind UV photodetectors with fast and electrically tuneable response time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: n-Ga2O3/p-GaN heterojunction based photodetector devices are fabricated on Si-doped (-201) \beta-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique on p-type c-GaN/sapphire templates. These devices demonstrate the ability to act as highly efficient self-powered visible blind UV-photodetectors with fast response time. It has been found that the optimum performance of the detector in terms of its responsivity, detectivity and response time could be achieved by adjusting the Si doping level and the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer. Our best performing device showing the peak responsivity and detectivity of 56.8 mA/W and 3*10^12 Jones, respectively, is achieved for 660 nm thick Ga2O3 layer with Si-concentration of 8*10^18 cm^-3. Moreover, as low as a few nW of optical signal can be sensed by the detector. The response time of the detector is found to be only a few tens of nanoseconds, which highlights their potential for application in ultrafast detection of UV light. These devices also exhibit a slower component of photoresponse with a timescale of a few tens of milliseconds. Interestingly, the time-scale of the slower response can be prolongated by several orders of magnitude through enhancing the applied reverse bias. Such an electrical tuneability of the response time is highly desirable for neuromorphic device applications.</description>

      <title>Near-field effects on cathodoluminescence outcoupling in perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite semiconductors are a promising material for high-efficiency solar cells. Their optical properties can vary within and between crystallographic grains. We present spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy at 2 keV and 5 keV on polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films to study these variations at the nanoscale. The CL maps show a strongly reduced intensity near the polycrystalline grain boundaries. We perform numerical simulations of the far-field emission of the electron beam-generated optical near fields using the surface profiles from AFM as input. We find that near grain boundaries the light outcoupling is strongly reduced due to enhanced internal reflection and light trapping at the curved surfaces. Lateral variations in CL intensity inside grains are due to Fabry-Perot-like resonances in the film, with the substrate acting as a back reflector. Our results show that near-field coupling and interference effects can dominate nanoscale luminescence maps of halide perovskite films. The results are broadly relevant for the analysis of cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of corrugated thin films.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Modeling of Nanotwinned Materials: Orientation Effects in a Multilayer Twinned Structure of Copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of twin boundaries (TBs) on the microstructure evolution and plastic deformation mechanisms of face-centered cubic (FCC) metals has been extensively studied since the discovery that nanotwinned materials exhibit a favorable combination of high strength and ductility. In this work, a dislocation-twin boundary interaction model for copper is incorporated into a three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) framework. This approach is applied to systematically investigate the orientation effects on the deformation of nanotwinned copper, utilizing a multilayer twinned structure (MTS) with a twin thickness of 160 nm.
  The simulation results show that the stress-strain response of MTSs under uniaxial loading depends significant on the orientation of the loading axis. Dislocations inclined to TBs are confined to slip in single- or multi-layer twin lamellae; when the loading axis is oriented perpendicular or parallel to TBs, such whereas when loading axis inclined to TBs, the dislocations with glide plane parallel to TBs are easily activated (mainly twinning dislocations) and the TBs do not hinder the dislocations and behave in soft modes. If the hard mode dominates the deformation mechanism, microstructures with single-layer confined slip lead to significant hardening behavior, while microstructures with multilayer confined slip maintain stable plastic flow and do not lead to hardening. Finally, through the introduction of critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) specific to various deformation modes and the adaptation of Schmid's law, we have effectively projected the additional anisotropic characteristics induced by TBs in MTSs.</description>

      <title>All-electrical switching of spin texture in a strain-tunable 2D Janus ferroelectric altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a collinear magnetic phase with momentum-dependent spin splitting, is a promising candidate for strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, realizing direct and tunable coupling between ferroelectricity (FE) and AM within a single two-dimensional (2D) material remains an outstanding challenge. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify the distorted phase of monolayer Janus VOClBr as an intrinsic 2D FE-AM. This phase demonstrates robust magnetoelectric coupling, as evidenced by a complete reversal of momentum-space spin polarization upon FE switching, and further supported by spin texture analysis and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Notably, the FE properties are highly strain-tunable: biaxial compression strain of -4% reduces the FE polarization switching barrier by approximately 87%, whereas a tensile strain of +3% induces a phase transition to an antiferromagnet. Leveraging the lock-in between the electrically controlled spin texture and the magneto-optical Kerr effect signal, we propose a non-volatile, polymorphic spintronic memory device featuring all-electrical writing and optical readout. This work establishes 2D FE-AMs as a versatile platform for coupled ferroic orders and paves the way for voltage-controlled, multifunctional spin-logic devices.</description>

      <title>Lanthanide-Dependent Clustering in Yb$^{3+}$/Ln$^{3+}$ Co-Doped CaF$_2$ Nanocrystals: Correlating Spectroscopic Signatures with DFT Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of heterogeneous lanthanide-ion clusters in CaF$_2$ was investigated experimentally and computationally. CaF$_2$ nanoparticles co-doped with 20~mol\% Yb$^{3+}$ and 2~mol\% Ln$^{3+}$ (Ln$^{3+}$ = Ce$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, Nd$^{3+}$, Sm$^{3+}$, Eu$^{3+}$, Gd$^{3+}$, Ho$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Tm$^{3+}$) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. High-resolution Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy revealed the presence of Yb$^{3+}$ isolated cubic centers and various cluster sites. The relative concentration of the clusters varied with the choice of the co-doping ion. Calculations based on density functional theory were used to estimate the formation energies and local coordination structures of different clusters. The calculations indicate that the neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing Ln$^{3+}$ tend to decrease across the lanthanide series, while the negatively charged derivatives of hexameric clusters are relatively constant. This variation matches the experimental results. This study advances understanding of the clustering mechanisms in lanthanide-doped CaF$_2$ nanoparticles and has implications for luminescence optimization in advanced nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Revealing the (111) surface electronic structure of epitaxially grown Na$_2$KSb photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study has established the Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathode as a highly efficient emitter of spin-polarized electrons. However, the electronic structure of alkali antimonides remains poorly understood. In this work, we report the first crystalline epitaxial growth of Na$_2$KSb films, achieved via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a graphene-coated SiC(0001) substrate. The high crystalline quality of these films enabled a direct investigation of the material's electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By comparing the experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have identified dispersive surface states originating from different terminations of the Na$_2$KSb(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the crystalline order of the film is preserved following its activation via the deposition of Cs and Sb. This finding opens a pathway for investigating the electronic structure of multialkali Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathodes and for rationally improving their properties.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Plasticity-based GND Density Estimation Methods in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations, accurately quantifying geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) is critical for capturing strain gradients in polycrystals. We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch.</description>

      <title>Atomic imaging of 2D transition metal dihalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal di-iodides such as FeI2, NiI2 and CoI2 are an emerging class of 2D magnets exhibiting rich and diverse magnetic behaviour, but their study at the monolayer limit has been severely hindered by fabrication challenges due to their air-sensitivity. Here, we introduce a polymer-free method for clean, rapid, and high-yield assembly of hermetically encapsulated suspended samples of air-sensitive monolayers. Applying it to di-iodides enables atomic resolution characterisation of thin samples - down to the monolayer limit - for the first time. Our imaging, combined with complementary first-principles calculations, reveals an unusually small energy barrier between alternate stable stacking polytypes in few-layer films, enabling extrinsic control of the stacking phase. We also observe stable isolated iodine vacancies that do not aggregate to form extended structures, and identify and verify the stability of the various edge configurations of thin samples. These results establish the unique structural characteristics of these materials in the thin limit, and more broadly demonstrate the utility of our transfer platform for creating atomically clean suspended vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Twisting Kelvin Cells for Enhanced Vibration Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.</description>

      <title>Accelerated design of proton exchange membranes for green hydrogen production with artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly method for hydrogen production that has reached significant levels of technological maturity. Among commercialized water-electrolysis technologies, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers offer high current density, fast dynamic response, and compact system design, among other advantages. On the other hand, managing their high capital cost and the ``forever-chemistry'' nature of Nafion, a perfluorinated proton-exchange membrane widely used in such devices, remains a major challenge. Searches for fluorine-free replacements for Nafion, pursued largely through physical experimentation, have been active for decades with limited success. In this work, we develop and demonstrate an AI-based strategy for designing new proton-exchange membranes for electrolyzers. Two key components of this strategy are an implementation of the virtual forward-synthesis approach and a set of machine-learning predictive models for essential application-inspired membrane properties; the former generates a vast space of millions of synthesizable polymers, which are then evaluated and screened by the latter. The strategy is validated against experimental data for known membranes and then applied to design over 1,700 new synthesizable candidates. This article concludes with a forward-looking vision in which the strategy could be elevated into an interactive and iterative scheme that are based on large language models to facilitate materials design in multiple ways.</description>

      <title>Towards Self-Optimizing Electron Microscope: Robust Tuning of Aberration Coefficients via Physics-Aware Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.</description>

      <title>qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.</description>

      <title>Transport spin polarization in RuO$_2$ films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets host spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, enabling spin-polarized transport in the absence of conventional ferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a candidate altermagnet, yet experimental reports remain conflicting, particularly between bulk-sensitive probes and thin-film measurements. Here we investigate the electronic transport properties of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films using anomalous Hall effect measurements and point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We observe transport spin polarization and a strongly orientation-dependent anomalous Hall response, while magnetometry reveals no detectable net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect appears only in ultrathin (110)-oriented films, consistent with symmetry-driven N\'eel-vector physics, and the measured transport spin polarization is systematically higher for (110)-oriented films than for (001)-oriented films, consistent with the crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-split bands. These results are consistent with altermagnetic behavior in RuO$_2$, with the experimentally accessible signatures confined to near-surface regions. They also establish superconducting transport spectroscopy as a metrology for identifying and characterizing altermagnet candidates.</description>

      <title>Design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of 2D devices for scanning tunneling microscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design and fabrication of guiding patterns for topography-based searching of two-dimensional (2D) devices for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements. Sub-micron geometric coordinate markers were etched into SiO2/Si wafers, serving as both substrates for 2D device integration and guiding maps for sample navigation. Here, we used a monolayer graphene/h-BN device with an active area of smaller than 20 um x 20 um as a model system and demonstrated that the device could be reliably located in STM solely through topographic imaging of the guiding patterns and in situ stage calibration, without reliance on optical viewports or capacitive sensing. Atomically resolved topographic imaging and tunneling spectroscopy were also obtained. Our proposed navigation strategy is fully compatible with standard device fabrication procedures and requires no hardware modification to existing STM setups. As such, it offers a practical alternative for locating miniaturized devices in STM, shedding light on studying emerging quantum phenomena in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Boson peak in the dynamical structure factor of network- and packing-type glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are structurally disordered solids that host, in addition to crystalline-like phonons, vibrational excitations with no direct phononic counterpart. A long-standing universal signature is the excess vibrational density of states~(vDOS) over the Debye prediction, known as the boson peak~(BP), which has been extensively reported via inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering measurements of the dynamical structure factor $S(q,\omega)$. Here we quantify the vDOS directly from dynamical-structure-factor data and clarify the microscopic origin of the BP. We contrast two routes to extract the vDOS from $S(q,\omega)$: (i) using high-wavenumber $q$ data beyond the Debye wavenumber $q_D$ to access predominantly incoherent scattering and recover the vDOS in a manner analogous to velocity-autocorrelation-based approaches; and (ii) integrating $S(q,\omega)$ over the low-$q$ regime below $q_D$, which enables a decomposition of the vDOS into contributions from distinct wavenumber sectors and thereby provides direct access to the spatial character of vibrational modes. Focusing on the second route, we demonstrate that the BP in the vDOS emerges as the spectral consequence of a dispersionless excitation band in $S(q,\omega)$. Our main results are obtained from molecular-dynamics simulations, and we further show that the same mechanism is captured by an effective-medium theory for random spring networks, providing a unified interpretation that connects the excess vDOS to the wavenumber-resolved structure of vibrational excitations in glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break a combination of time-reversal and rotational symmetries without generating a net magnetization. As such, the order parameter of $d$-wave altermagnets has the same symmetry as magnetic multipoles, and couples to the product of a magnetic field and uniaxial strain. We combine elastocaloric experiments, free-energy modeling, and first-principles calculations on MnF$_2$ to establish a thermodynamic probe of the predicted finite-temperature altermagnetic critical point. These results pave the way to explore altermagnetic quantum criticality in $d$-wave materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dual-Switch Control of a Layer-Locked Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in a Sliding Ferroelectric Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders in twodimensional (2D) materials provides a promising avenue for the nonvolatile control of coupled spin and valley degrees of freedom, a capability central to advancing spinvalleytronics. However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices.</description>

      <title>Locally Scaled Self-Interaction Corrected Energy Functionals with Complex Optimal Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully variational locally scaled self-interaction corrected (SIC) energy functional using complex optimal orbitals. This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\leq z(\mathbf{r}) \leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density. The locally scaled and fully variational SIC framework is general and applicable to atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus in the Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet Rb2Co2(SeO3)3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\) and \(5/6\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \(M/M_s = 1/6\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \(U(1)\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \(U(1)\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and optical addressability. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance indirectly via changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, eliminating the need for optical excitation or fluorescence detection of the $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$. Cross-relaxation between NV and $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles significantly reduces NV $T_1$, enabling quantitative nanoscale mapping of defect densities beyond the optical diffraction limit and clear resolution of hyperfine splitting in isotopically enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Our method demonstrates interactions between 3D and 2D spin sensors, establishing NV centers as versatile probes for characterizing otherwise inaccessible spin defects.</description>

Abstract: The strategy of breaking antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in alpha-Fe2O3 by doping non-magnetic Sc3+ ions at the Fe3+ sites has been used in Fe2-xScxO3 system (x = 0.2-1.0). The material has been stabilized in single-phase (rhombohedral alpha-Fe2O3) or mix-phase (rhombohedral alpha-Fe2O3 and cubic Sc2O3-types) structure by varying Sc content and heat treatment temperature. Neutron diffraction confirmed perturbed AFM ground state down to low temperature with magnetic moment 2.75-4.68 muB per Fe site and Morin transition 260 K. DC magnetic measurement showed magnetic coercivity 0.2 to 6 kOe. The material showed transformation from insulating state (conductivity 10-14-10-10 S per cm and polarization 0.5-2 micro-C per cm2) to high conductive state (conductivity 10-10 -10-7 S per cm and polarization greater than 2 micro-C per cm2) above the Morin transition. The room temperature measurements showed maximum current density 35-186 micro-A per cm2, electric polarization 2.7-15.6 micro-C per cm2, magneto-electric voltage up to 5 mV with coupling constant 0.62-10.11 mV per Oe.cm and magneto-conductance up to 90 %. The results will open the door for suitably modifying the lattice-structure, magnetic spin order, and charge-spin coupling in hematite based material and their application in low power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Link Statistics of Dislocation Network during Strain Hardening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing its formation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/PRDNet.</description>

      <title>Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex scaffold (threefold motif) but differ in the core-level polarization texture, resulting in an integer +1 per vortex offset in the plane-integrated (slice) topological charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass-like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the nanodomain axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure barium titanate retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the collapse temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.</description>

      <title>Following the Long-Term Evolution of sp$^3$-type Defects in Tritiated Graphene using Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the evolution of tritium-induced sp$^3$-defects in monolayer graphene on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, by comparing large-area Raman maps of the same two samples, acquired just after fabrication and twice thereafter, about 9-12 months apart. Inbetween measurements the samples were kept under standard laboratory conditions. Using a conservative classification of sp$^3$-type spectra, based on the D/D' peak intensity ratio, we observed almost complete depletion of sp$^3$-type defects over the investigation period of about two years. This by far exceeds the ~5.5% annual reduction expected from tritium decay alone (~3x larger). This change in the defect composition is accompanied by a recovery of the 2D-band of graphene and an overall decrease in defect-density, as determined via the D/G intensity ratio. Hydogenated graphene is reported to be reasonably stable over several months, when kept under vacuum, but suffers substantial hydrogen loss under laboratory air conditions. While the results shown here for tritiated graphene exhibit similarities with hydrogenated graphene, however, some distinct differences are observed.</description>

Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 &lt; $x$ &lt;= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fractional-Monolayer 2D-GaN/AlN Structures: Growth Kinetics and UVC-emitter Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper reports on fundamental properties of the GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs) with nominal subcritical thicknesses of 0.75-2 monolayers (MLs). They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters.</description>

      <title>Conductance of atomic size contacts of Ag and Au at high magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic conduction at the atomic scale can be described by Landauer's formalism. In single atom point contacts of noble metals like Au and Ag, there is just one channel open between both electrodes and the conductance is very close to the quantum of conductance $G \approx G_0=\frac{2e^2}{h}$, with the factor of two coming from spin degeneracy. The magnetoconductivity of atomic size contacts has been studied for numerous systems, unveiling local Kondo screening, magnetic order and spin-polarized currents. However, these have been mostly performed in elements with multiple open conduction channels where $G$ differs from $G_0$. The realization of a magnetically active conductor with a single open channel remains difficult to achieve. Here we present measurements of the electronic conductance of single channel Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields up to 20 Tesla. We observe a decrease in $G$ which goes up to about 15% in many Au contacts at 20 T. We perform calculations and find that pure Ag and Au do not present a strong field dependence of $G$, in agreement with previous results at smaller magnetic fields. We also find, however, that residual O$_2$ molecules attached close to the contact produce an an induced spin-polarized current, which leads to a decrease in $G$. We discuss the role of the magnetic response of the electrodes in the jump to contact. Our results suggest that single channel atomic size conductors with a sizeable response to a magnetic field can be built by combining noble metals and magnetically active molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene, exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, ranging from gapless to a large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the electronic structure of few-layer graphene composed of a layer of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with a two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite, we show how different configurations of such heterostructures can affect the electronic structure, which is different from that of their components. Our results show that systems composed of semiconducting AGNRs can not be seen as two separate systems. Namely, a local gap of ~0.6 eV at the Dirac point for dispersive bands can be opened in a bilayer configuration composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene. We demonstrate that the band steepness in these structures can be tuned, highlighting their potential for electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description>

      <title>Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</description>
