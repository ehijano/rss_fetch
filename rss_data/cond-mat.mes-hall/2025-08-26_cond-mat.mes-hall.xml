      <title>Electronic correlation effects in the response of graphene and MoS2 monolayers to the impact of highly-charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2 is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF). In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic gating and the interference of chiral Majoranas in thin slabs of magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interference of chiral Majoranas in a magnetic topological insulator thin slab having a grounded section proximity coupled to a superconductor and another section under the influence of top-bottom electrostatic gating. The gated section locally widens an energy gap and mediates the coupling between the quantum anomalous Hall states of the leads and the chiral Majorana states of the proximitized sector. Local and non-local conductances offer measurable hints of the existence of transport mediated by chiral Majorana modes. Local conductances on the two leads reveal characteristic oscillatory patterns as a function of the gating strength, with peculiar correlations depending on the distance between gated and proximitized sectors. A gate tunable Majorana diode effect on nonlocal conductances emerges when the chemical potential deviates from zero. We suggest a protocol to identify chiral Majorana physics based on a sequence of electrostatic gates that allows the tuning of chiral Majorana interference.</description>

      <title>A Single-Molecule Quantum Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-exchange heat engines operate without moving parts or time-dependent driving, relying solely on static energy-selective transport. Here, we realize a particle-exchange quantum heat engine based on a single diradical molecule, only a few nanometers in size. We experimentally investigate its operation at low temperatures and demonstrate that both the power output and efficiency are significantly enhanced by Kondo correlations, reaching up to 53 % of the Curzon-Ahlborn limit. These results establish molecular-scale particle-exchange engines as promising candidates for low-temperature applications where extreme miniaturization and energy efficiency are paramount.</description>

      <title>Resonant transport and line-type resonances in tilted Dirac cone double-barrier structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Dirac fermions in a graphene-based double-barrier structure composed of two tilted-cone regions separated by a central pristine graphene region. Using the transfer matrix method, we systematically analyze how different cone tilts affect Dirac fermion transmission. In reciprocal space, at fixed energy, the Dirac cones of distinct regions generate isoenergetic conical surfaces (Fermi surfaces). When these surfaces overlap, their intersections define ``active surfaces'' that enable fermion transmission. In the symmetric double-barrier configuration, coupling between the barriers and the central well gives rise to multiple resonance peaks, including line-type resonances, even within nominally forbidden energy zones. The number and positions of these resonances depend sensitively on the system parameters. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dirac cone tilt in complex junctions and may guide the design of nanoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional tilted-cone materials such as $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ and borophene.</description>

      <title>Correlations in the Binding Energy of Triexcitons and Biexcitons in Single CdSe/CdS Nanoplatelets Revealed by Heralded Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets present reduced Auger recombination, giving rise to enhanced multiexciton emission. This virtue makes them good candidates to investigate higher-order carrier dynamics, allowing to extract important excitonic properties, such as biexciton and triexciton binding energies that highly influence applications involving high excitation fluxes. Here, we explore triexciton emission, emanating from single core/shell CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets. We apply heralded post-selection of photon triplets using an advanced home-built single-photon spectrometer in order to resolve the triexciton$-$biexciton$-$exciton$-$ground state cascaded relaxation both in time and spectrum, and unambiguously determine the triexciton relaxation route and interaction nature. The results show a characteristic blue shift of the biexciton and triexciton, pointing to repulsive multiexciton interaction in the nanoplatelets under study. The relatively small measured energy shift of the triexciton (5.9 $\pm$ 0.7 meV) indicates that it recombines through the 1S bands rather than the 1P bands, in agreement with findings on other colloidal quantum dot systems. Most importantly, the strong correlation between the biexciton and triexciton binding energies, and the ability to tune them via control of the particle dimensions and composition, paves the way for developing emitters of nearly degenerate photon triplets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) cross-over diagram to map the relationship between device dimension (x-axis) and bias voltage (y-axis). This cross-over diagram conveniently separates the different physical regimes of the devices. This framework is used to explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices near the x-axis, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. In a perfect waveguide geometry, we find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet-Kulik levels is equal to the inverse of the number of transverse channels, due to the number of conserved quantities equal to the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane angle resolved second harmonic Hall analysis in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second Harmonic Hall (SHH) measurement is a standard and well accepted technique to estimate spin orbit torque (SOT) efficiencies in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) systems. Generally, field sweep and in-plane angle sweep SHH measurements are performed and SOT efficiency calculation is done using effective fields based formalism. In this article, we demonstrate an alternate experimental approach of out-of-plane (OOP) angle resolved SHH measurement in PMA systems for SOT efficiencies estimation. Also, we present an alternate formalism for SOT efficiency extraction, derived by solving LLGS equation in the low frequency limit of magnetic susceptibility. Along with SHH measurements, we also experimentally demonstrate anomalous Hall effect (AHE) based spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) for PMA systems.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions between bosonic and fermionic quantum Hall states near even-denominator filling factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum critical point between the fermionic $\nu=8$ quantum Hall state and the bosonic $\nu=2$ quantum Hall state of Cooper pairs. Our study is motivated by the composite fermion construction for the daughter states of even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states and the experimentally observed transition between the daughter and the Jain states at the same filling. We show that this transition is equivalent to the transition between a neutral invertible $E_8$ state and a topologically trivial state. These transitions can be described in a partonic framework as a cascade of mass changes of four neutral Dirac fermions coupled to multiple Abelian Chern-Simons $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the absence of fine-tuning, the transition is split into a series of four or more different transitions, with at least three distinct intermediate topologically ordered phases hosting neutral anyons.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine interaction of electrons confined in CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals with nuclear spin fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of electrons are investigated for CsPbI$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix using time-resolved Faraday ellipticity. In nanocrystals with a diameter of about 11 nm, the Larmor precession frequency has a linear dependence on magnetic field corresponding to the electron Land\'e $g$-factor of 2.07. We find a finite Larmor precession frequency at zero magnetic field, corresponding to the electron spin splitting of $0.8$ $\mu$eV. This splitting is explained by the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spin fluctuations. Our model analysis shows that the hyperfine interaction for the conduction band electrons is contributed both by the $p$-orbitals of the lead atoms and by the $s$-orbitals of the iodine atoms, with the leading contribution to the hyperfine field fluctuations coming from iodine. This fact agrees well with the 9% iodine contribution to the Bloch amplitude of the conduction band, obtained by DFT calculations. From these findings, the atomic hyperfine constant for the $5s$-orbital of iodine is evaluated as 190 $\mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion Scattering Revealed by Direct Time-Resolved Imaging of Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering analysis offers a fundamental route to revealing particle interactions with direct implications for device technologies relying on ensembles of particles such as magnetic skyrmions. Here, we directly visualize, in real time, the nanosecond current-driven dynamics of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmion lattice using element-specific pump-probe X-ray microscopy. By tuning spin-orbit torque relative to local pinning potentials, we reveal two regimes: incoherent flow, where mobile skyrmions scatter from pinned ones, inducing recoil dynamics with 3-20 ns relaxation, and coherent flow, where the lattice translates uniformly. Quantification of the reproducible post-pulse relaxation trajectories via an inverse analyis method based on the Thiele equation yields the nanoscale AFM skyrmion-skyrmion scattering potential, which decays exponentially with a range of 30 nm, in full agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At higher current densities, the lattice exhibits coherent motion free from detectable Hall and inertial effects or dynamical deformation, enabling robust GHz operation. These findings establish a quantitative framework for AFM skyrmion interactions and demonstrate deterministic control of their collective dynamics over billions of cycles even in the incoherent flow regime, thereby paving the way for multi-skyrmion spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dispersion interaction of two graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir method for determining the dispersive force by varying zero vacuum energy fluctuations is applied to two graphene sheets in the approximation of the Drude model for surface conductivity. As an alternative, the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances, the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases, reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature anisotropic in-plane spin dynamics in graphene induced by PdSe$_2$ proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene, resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime.</description>

      <title>Gapless Edge Gravitons and Quasiparticles in Fractional Quantum Hall Systems with Non-Local Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central tenets of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect is that the bulk quantized Hall response requires the existence of a gapless chiral edge mode. The field theoretical arguments for this rely on locality. While locality is typically met in standard experimental settings, it need not always apply. Motivated by experimental capabilities of photonic platforms, we study confining potentials that are step-like in angular momentum, and thus non-local in position. We show that this non-local potential does not host conventional chiral edge modes. These are replaced by gapless spin-2 edge states, which we show are connected to the collective 'graviton' excitations that are gapped in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that FQH states host gapless (charged) quasiparticles on their edges, even in the absence of conventional edge modes. The edge state energies vanish as a power-law in system size, with an exponent that characterises the bulk topological order.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spiral patterns etched on Germanium</title>

Abstract: Thin metal film on Germanium, in the presence of water, results in a remarkable pattern forming system. Here we present an analysis of spirals spontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth dynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal film. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates from the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured engraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal catalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is inversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The growth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and thin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range field can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General features relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of chemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order.</description>

      <title>Molecular Tools for Non-Planar Surface Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigations of on-surface chemistry on passivated silicon have only shown in-plane chemical reactions, and studies on bare silicon are limited in facilitating additional reactions post-molecular-attachment. Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100) through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific "molecular tools". Following an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework, a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled on silicon.</description>

      <title>A Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Model for Nanoscale Surfactant-laden Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multispecies diffuse interface model is formulated in a fluctuating hydrodynamics framework for the purpose of simulating surfactant interfaces at the nanoscale. The model generalizes previous work to ternary mixtures, employing a Cahn-Hilliard free energy density combined with incompressible, isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics where dissipative fluxes include both deterministic and stochastic terms. The intermolecular parameters in the free energy are chosen such that one species acts as a partially miscible surfactant. From Laplace pressure measurements we show that in this model the surface tension decreases linearly with surfactant concentration, leading to Marangoni convection for interfaces with concentration gradients. In the capillary wave spectrum for interfaces with and without surfactant we find that for the former the spectrum deviates significantly from classical capillary wave theory, presumably due to Gibbs elasticity. In non-equilibrium simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, deterministic simulations showed that the surfactant delays pinching of a fluid cylinder into droplets. However, stochastic simulations indicate that thermal fluctuations disrupt the surfactant's stabilizing effect. Similarly, the spreading of a patch of surfactant, driven by Marangoni convection, was found to be partially suppressed by thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Strong spin-magnon coupling in a van der Waals magnet with tunable chiral symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies require platforms that can coherently interface qubits with bosonic excitations. Photons have traditionally played this role in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but achieving the same goal using solid-state bosons remains challenging. Here we demonstrate strong and tunable spin-magnon coupling between molecular spin qubits and magnons in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator. Using [Gd(W$_5$O$_{18}$)$_{2}$]$^{9-}$ as the spin ensemble and CrSBr as the magnonic resonator, we observe anticrossings and coherent hybridization, realizing magnon quantum electrodynamics for the first time. Crucially, by rotating the magnetic field, we can dynamically change the magnon symmetry from linear to chiral, enabling in-situ tuning of the coupling strength. Our results establish magnonic cavities as a platform for scalable chiral quantum optics with magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Breaking conservation law enables steady-state entanglement out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how entangled steady states can be prepared by purely dissipative dynamics in a system coupled to a thermal environment. While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary-limited thermal transport in suspended thin graphite across an unexplored thickness regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</description>

      <title>Negative Spin $\Delta_T$ noise Induced by Spin-Flip Scattering and Andreev Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14072v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charge $\Delta_T$ noise, followed by an examination of spin $\Delta_T$ noise, in the normal metal-spin flipper-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (N-sf-N-I-S) junction. Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of electronic wavefunctions, encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. Whereas Berry curvature-mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Topological Amplification of the Bosonic Kitaev Chain with Non-Uniform Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bosonic Kitaev chain is known to have extraordinary properties distinct from its fermionic counterpart. For example, it exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect -- its eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain -- even when the system is Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian effects originate from the fact that the dynamics of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians is governed by a non-Hermitian matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to phase-dependent and directional exponential amplification of a classical drive. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipations. We examine the effect of uniform and non-uniform losses under various configurations. We find a remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. In particular, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological and the exponential amplification persists even for very large loss rates which exceed the system's non-Hermitian gap. On the other hand, we find that dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at a certain critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into the robustness against losses of the topological amplification of non-Hermitian systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor in realistic lossy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.</description>

      <title>A semiclassical nonequilibrium Green's Function approach to electron transport in systems exhibiting electron-phonon couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a semiclassical theory for electron transport in open quantum systems with electron-phonon interactions adequate for situations when the system's phonon dynamics is comparable with the electron transport timescale. Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we adopt the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switching Antenna for Covert Communication Implemented With Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in an Artificial Multiferroic Magnonic Crystal</title>

Abstract: Polarization switches are of great technological interest because of their many applications in long distance electromagnetic communication (e.g., polarization division multiplexing). Binary bits can be encoded in the two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave that they transmit. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically &gt; 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension, ~5 nm thickness) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial multiferroic magnonic crystal (AMMC)" is reported. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites confined spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, which then radiate electromagnetic waves in space via magnon-photon coupling. In some particular direction(s), determined by the AMMC parameters, the polarization of the beam at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions via activation of two different pairs of SAW launching electrodes. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along such a direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate covertly from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.</description>

      <title>Absolute measurement of the exchange interaction in an InSb quantum well using Landau-level tunnelling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Skyrmion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced phonon-drag by nanoscale design of homoepitaxial \hbox{$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda&gt;d$.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem: generic quadratic open fermionic systems governed by Lindblad master equations do not host dissipation-free topological edge states protected by the dissipation gap. By analogy with topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized non-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian. Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They establish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of lattices endowed with a Hamiltonian whose translation group $G$ is generic and possibly non-commutative. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying a superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \subset G$, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We discuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge group, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct two-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Importantly, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Applied Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of a weak external perturbation. General expressions for the QFI in the nonequilibrium steady-state are derived, which hold for arbitrary interacting many-body systems at finite or zero temperature, and can be related to susceptibilities or linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to *exponential* scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical measurements. In particular, we show that current-based metrology in quantum circuits can leverage many-body effects for enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Bias-Field Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Binary Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications. While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator. Our results show that BF-DCQO offers an effective path for solving large-scale HUBO problems on current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Existence of higher degree minimizers in the magnetic skyrmion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>
