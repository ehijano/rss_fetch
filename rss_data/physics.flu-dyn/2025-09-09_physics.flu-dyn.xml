      <title>Vector-based loss functions for turbulent flow field inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often beneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the training process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific characteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid velocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete points in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or computational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data is ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the mean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation. Therefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical characteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector similarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here and implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting problem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in PIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant challenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The test case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known Transparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on the cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the results show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and mean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between preserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.</description>

      <title>A capillary diode for potential application in water-oil separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A capillary device is designed and fabricated in glass to work as a fluidic diode with vanishingly small hydrodynamic conductance for imbibition of water within a finite range of immersion depths. This is attained through patterning a section of predefined length on the device surfaces using a single-step laser-based ablation process and without resorting to chemical treatment of the hydrophilic glass substrate. While the studied device works as a fluidic diode for water, it can behave as a conventional capillary slit for the imbibition of oils (e.g., alkanes, silicone oils) with low surface tension. A prototype device with simple geometric design is demonstrated for selective adsorption and separation of water and oil in vertical imbibition experiments at controlled immersion depths. Efficient devices for passive separation of water and oil can be designed based on the demonstrated physical mechanism and the analytical model proposed in this work.</description>

      <title>Bubble coalescence dynamics in a high-Reynolds number decaying turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally investigates bubble size evolution and void fraction redistribution in an unexplored, coalescence-dominated regime of decaying turbulent bubbly flow. The flow is generated downstream of a regenerative pump in a duct, with Taylor-scale Reynolds number (Re_\lambda~10^3), but turbulence decays rapidly along the duct. Shadowgraph imaging and particle shadow velocimetry are used for measurements. High-speed imaging and statistical analysis reveal that bubble coalescence dominates over breakup across most of the domain, leading to monotonic growth in Sauter mean diameter (d_{32}) and progressive broadening of the bubble size distribution. The normalised extreme-to-mean diameter ratio increases axially and asymptotically saturates at~2.2, indicating the emergence of a quasi-self-similar bubble size distribution. The probability density function of bubble diameter exhibits a dual power law tail with exponents $-10/3$ and -3/2 near the duct inlet, where the flow is coalescence-dominated. However, after a few hydraulic diameters, a single~-3/2 power law scaling emerges, indicating a regime of pure coalescence in which all bubbles are smaller than the Hinze scale. The cumulative distribution with d/d_{32} exponent (~1.3) emerges only after the size distribution stabilises. Although classical Hinze scaling gives d_H ~ L^0.9, our theory for d_{32} and~d_{99.8}(99.8th percentile bubble diameter) in a pure-coalescence regime predicts the slower law~ L^0.5, which our experimental results confirm, indicating negligible breakup and sub-Hinze growth. In contrast to current models, transient void fraction profiles evolve from nearly uniform to sharply core-peaked Gaussian distributions in the developing regime, with increasing centerline values and decreasing near-wall values, due to lift-force reversal.</description>

      <title>Decay of two-dimensional superfluid turbulence over pinning surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Learning Rarefied Gas Dynamics with Physics-Enforced Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops and validates neural network frameworks with physics-based constraints for surrogate modeling of rarefied gas dynamics across different levels of complexity. As a baseline, we first examine the BGK kinetic relaxation problem and show that reformulating the learning task in terms of the perturbation from the Maxwell Boltzmann equilibrium ensures stability and accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we employ Deep Operator Networks, DeepONets, with physical constraints to address two more challenging problems. The first is the prediction of the one-dimensional structure of a standing shock wave in a rarefied polyatomic gas at Mach 5, where the incorporation of physical constraints avoids overshoot and yields accurate predictions even for unseen viscosity ratios. The second is the modeling of two-dimensional rarefied hypersonic flow over a cylinder, where an ensemble of DeepONets trained on a sparse dataset obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo, DSMC, approach, generalizes successfully to both interpolation and extrapolation cases up to M equal to 10. A custom weighted loss function improves the prediction of pressure, while ensemble-based uncertainty quantification correctly identifies regions of high gradients such as shock waves. The results demonstrate that embedding physical constraints into neural operator architectures enables accurate, physically consistent, and computationally efficient surrogates, paving the way for their application to multi-dimensional high-speed rarefied flow problems.</description>

      <title>Influence of Boundary Conditions and Heating Modes on the Onset of Columnar Convection in Rotating Spherical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear onset of thermal convection in rotating spherical shells with a focus on the influence of mechanical boundary conditions and thermal driving modes. Using a spectral method, we determine critical Rayleigh numbers, azimuthal wavenumbers, and oscillation frequencies over a wide range of Prandtl numbers and shell aspect ratios at moderate Ekman numbers. We show that the preferred boundary condition for convective onset depends systematically on both aspect ratio and Prandtl number: for sufficiently thick shells or for large $\text{Pr}$, the Ekman boundary layer at the outer boundary becomes destabilising, so that no-slip boundaries yield a lower $\text{Ra}_c$ than stress-free boundaries. Comparing differential and internal heating, we find that internal heating generally raises $\text{Ra}_c$, shifts the onset to larger wavenumbers and frequencies, and relocates the critical column away from the tangent cylinder. Mixed boundary conditions with no-slip on the inner boundary behave similarly to purely stress-free boundaries, confirming the dominant influence of the outer surface. These results demonstrate that boundary conditions and heating mechanisms play a central role in controlling the onset of convection and should be carefully considered in models of planetary and stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>Helical Locomotion in Yield Stress Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report three stages for locomotion of a helical swimmer in yield stress fluids. In the first stage, the swimmer must overcome material's yield strain to generate rotational motion. However, exceeding the first threshold is not sufficient for locomotion. Only when the viscous forces are sufficiently strong to plastically deform the material to a finite distance away from the swimmer, net locomotion will occur. Once locomotion is underway in the third stage, the yield stress retards swimming at small pitch angles. Conversely, at large pitch angles, yield stress dominates the flow by enhancing swimming speed. Flow visualizations reveal a highly localized flow near the swimmer in yield stress fluids.</description>

      <title>An Unsplit Scheme for Interface Advection in the Edge-based Interface Tracking (EBIT) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unsplit scheme for interface advection in a novel Front-Tracking method, called the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method. In the EBIT method, the markers are placed on the grid edges, and their connectivity is implicitly represented using a color vertex field. In our previous publications, a split scheme was used to advect the interface in the EBIT method. Although the split scheme facilitates the extension of the EBIT method to three dimensions, it also imposes some limitations. First, implementing high-order time integration methods for interface advection becomes challenging. Second, in multiscale simulations using Front-Tracking methods with a boundary layer model applied to the interface, the redistribution of physical quantities inside the boundary layer, such as a scalar concentration, along the interface becomes difficult due to the loss of correspondence between interface segments before and after each advection step, caused by the operator split. Here, we present an unsplit scheme for interface advection to enhance the capability of the EBIT method. In the unsplit scheme, a reconstruction step based on a circle fit, similar to that used in the split scheme, is performed to reposition markers on the cell edges. Furthermore, the algorithm used to update the color vertex field, which implicitly represents marker connectivity and distinguishes among ambiguous topology configurations, is modified to achieve consistent connectivity results. An EBIT method based on an unsplit scheme has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and validated with four kinematic test cases: translation with uniform velocity, solid body rotation, Zalesak's disk rotation, and single vortex test. The results are compared with those obtained using the original EBIT method based on a split scheme.</description>

      <title>Wave-like Spiral Interactions and the Emergence of Quasi-Biennial Oscillations in Strato-Rotational Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of Strato-Rotational Instability (SRI) in a stratified, rotating fluid, focusing on the interaction between axial modes and spiral components. Through numerical analysis, we find that SRI induces oscillatory behaviors that change the mean flow, leading to the selective activation of distinct axial wavenumbers associated with upward and downward propagating spiral modes. These results suggest wave-mean flow interactions. The use of Radon Transforms (RT) allowed us to separate these spiral components, showing that each upward and downward component was individually modulated, but out of phase with each other. Inspired by the RT findings, a simplified toy model was developed to interpret the spiral pattern changes linked to amplitude modulations. The model considers two wave-like spirals propagating in opposite axial directions, linearly interacting. By incorporating out-of-phase individual spiral modulations, the model reproduces the observed spiral pattern transitions, offering a straightforward interpretation of the underlying physical processes. To explore the mechanism of individual spiral modulations, we consider a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)-like framework derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame. These findings contribute to a better understanding of low-frequency SRI dynamics and may offer insights into similar phenomena in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an autocatalytic reaction front: effects of imposed turbulence and buoyancy-driven flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin flame dynamics in a turbulent flow remains debated, with various parameterizations proposed for the typical flame propagation velocity. According to the classical Damk\"ohler's model based on Huygens' principle, a flame front should advance at a constant velocity normal to the interface between reactants and products, with a turbulent acceleration induced by the wrinkling and surface increase of the interface. However, combustion experiments often deviate from this model due to intertwined thermal and turbulent effects, complicating flame acceleration characterization. In this study, we use an autocatalytic reaction that generates a thin reactive front in an aqueous medium, enabling clearer isolation of turbulence effects. Using oscillating grids to generate turbulence in a closed tank, we examine two configurations: a single-grid setup with a spatially decaying turbulence and a dual-grid system with in the middle, a nearly homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. Particle Image Velocimetry and Laser Induced Fluorescence measurements capture both the velocity field and the front propagation, revealing two different regimes: the expected Huygens' propagation regime, but also a reactive mixing regime, where the turbulent advection of the products inside the reactants initiates multiple, dispersed reaction locations. Additionally, we show that even the small density difference between reactants and products plays a crucial role in the front dynamics. This work advances our understanding of autocatalytic fronts in turbulence, emphasizing the critical interplay between chemical kinetics and flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>HiPrFlame-An ab initio based real-fluid modeling approach for high-pressure combustion-I. Rationale, methodology, and application to laminar premixed flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-pressure combustion is central to modern propulsion and power-generation systems, where operating pressures often exceed the critical point of working fluids, resulting in pronounced real-fluid effects that fundamentally alter thermodynamic and transport properties. High-pressure combustion is central to modern propulsion and power-generation systems, where operating pressures often exceed the critical point of working fluids, resulting in pronounced real-fluid effects that fundamentally alter thermodynamic and transport properties. Existing methods for quantifying real-fluid behaviors typically rely on empirical correlations, fitted potentials, and cubic equations of state, which lack the accuracy required for species coverage and extreme conditions encountered in combustion processes. As such, this study introduces HiPrFlame, a novel ab initio-based modeling framework for high-pressure combustion, designed to deliver unprecedented fidelity in real-fluid property prediction in high-pressure combustion modeling. HiPrFlame integrates third-order Virial EoS derived from ab initio intermolecular potentials, thereby real-fluid departure functions for real-fluid thermodynamics and Enskog theory for real-fluid transport properties, with all implemented within a versatile OpenFOAM architecture that can be used for 0-D to 3-D real-fluid modeling. To accelerate multidimensional simulations, artificial neural network surrogate models are trained on a comprehensive property database, enabling efficient real-fluid property updating. The framework is demonstrated through case studies of high-pressure hydrogen combustion, including homogeneous autoignition and one-dimensional laminar premixed flames. Results demonstrate that HiPrFlame accurately captures experimental data for both thermodynamic and transport properties, significantly outperforming traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Seeing new depths: Three-dimensional flow of a free-swimming alga</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A swimming microorganism stirs the surrounding fluid, creating a flow field that governs not only its locomotion and nutrient uptake, but also its interactions with other microorganisms and the environment. Despite its fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior. The work establishes a powerful method for comprehensively mapping the fluid environment sculpted by the beating flagella of motile cells.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions between fluid flows and solid materials and structures-a field known as fluid-structure interaction -is central not only to established disciplines such as aerospace and naval engineering but also to emerging technologies such as energy harvesting, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. In recent years, the advent of metamaterials-rationally designed composites with properties beyond their constituents, often not found in conventional materials-has provided exciting opportunities for rethinking and redesigning fluid-structure interaction. The premise of engineering the internal structure of materials interfacing with fluid flows is opening a new horizon for precise and effective manipulation and control of coupled fluidic, acoustic, and elastodynamics responses. This review focuses on this relatively unexplored interdisciplinary theme with broad real-world technological significance. Key performance metrics, such as fuel consumption of transport systems, efficiency of renewable energy extraction, mitigation of noise emissions, and resilience to structural fatigue, depend on the control of interactions between flow, acoustic, and vibration mechanisms. Flow control, for example, which spans a wealth of regimes such as laminar, transitional, turbulent, and unsteady separated flows, is highly influenced by the ability to tailor fluid-structure interaction behavior. We survey and discuss theoretical frameworks that describe the interplay between fluids and elastic solids, with a focus on contemporary work and emerging concepts. The paper is organised into three main sections-flow-structure interactions, acoustic-structure interactions, and exotic metamaterial concepts with potential impact on fluid-structure interaction-and concludes with perspectives on current challenges and future directions in this rapidly expanding area of research.</description>

      <title>Self-similar rupture of thin films of power-law fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models that describe Newtonian liquid films evolving due to the competing effects of surface tension and attractive intermolecular or van der Waals forces are known to rupture in finite time in a self-similar manner. We extend the computation of similarity solutions to non-Newtonian power-law liquid films. The bifurcation diagram, indexed by power law exponent $n$, has a highly nontrivial structure with branches merging via a snaking bifurcation around $n=1$. A countably infinite number of solutions are also found in the extreme shear-thinning ($n\to 0$) limit, in which similarity solutions possess an exponentially small inner region. Numerical simulations are shown to be attracted to the single primary branch of similarity solutions.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer Dynamics Generated by Non-Axisymmetric Tornado-Type Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy cascade in turbulence, first statistically described by Richardson (1922) and Kolmogorov (1941), lacked connection to the underlying fluid dynamics. Recent numerical studies of Goto et al. (2017) and Yoneda et al. (2022) revealed scale-local energy transfer via vortex stretching but remained within spatial statistics. This study aims to uncover the time-dependent elementary process behind the energy cascade by constructing a tornado-type flow in a non-axisymmetric curved cylindrical domain. Our approach reveals specific vortex dynamics responsible for energy transfer, offering new insight into the physical mechanisms of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Tidally Induced Turbulence in the Abyssal Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the upwelling branch of the abyssal overturning circulation is characterized by strong flows driven by turbulence along sloping topography. The Boundary Layer Turbulence field campaign has provided direct evidence for strong upslope flows along a deep submarine canyon of the Rockall Trough. Turbulent overturning events spanning 200 m in the vertical were observed every tidal cycle, suggesting that the strong tidal flows in the canyon periodically undergo some form of instability. However, it is shown that the flow never satisfied the classical instability condition for time-independent sheared flows in a stratified fluid commonly used in oceanographic studies to determine transition to turbulence. This study illustrates that the time dependence of the tidal flow changes the stability properties and explains the observed transition to a turbulent state. The findings suggest that turbulent mixing induced by oscillatory shear flow may be ubiquitous over sloping topography and play an important role in deep ocean mixing that supports the global overturning circulation.</description>

      <title>Unstable mode around the 3D boundary layer flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability properties of boundary layer-type shear flows for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of small viscosity $0&lt;\nu\ll 1$. When the streamwise and spanwise velocity profiles are linearly independent near the boundary, we construct an unstable mode that exhibits rapid growth at the rate of $e^{t/\sqrt{\nu}}$. Our results reveal an analytic instability in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations around generic boundary layer profiles. This instability arises from the interplay between spanwise flow and three-dimensional perturbations, and does not occur in purely two-dimensional flows.</description>

      <title>Differentiable DG with Neural Operator Source Term Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational advances have fundamentally transformed the landscape of numerical simulations, enabling unprecedented levels of complexity and precision in modeling physical phenomena. While these high-fidelity simulations offer invaluable insights for scientific discovery and problem solving, they impose substantial computational requirements. Consequently, low-fidelity models augmented with subgrid-scale parameterizations are employed to achieve computational feasibility. We introduce an end-to-end differentiable framework for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This integrated approach combines a differentiable discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver with a neural network source term. Through the implementation of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) for network parameter optimization, our methodology ensures continuous interaction with the governing equations throughout the training process. We refer to this approach as NODE-DG. This hybrid approach combines the accuracy of numerical methods with the efficiency of machine learning, offering the following key advantages: (1) improved accuracy of low-order DG approximations by capturing subgrid-scale dynamics; (2) robustness against nonuniform or missing temporal data; (3) elimination of operator-splitting errors; (3) total mass conservation; and (4) a continuous-in-time operator that enables variable time step predictions, which accelerate projected high-order DG simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework through two examples: two-dimensional Kelvin--Helmholtz instability and three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex examples.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier Equations for Rarefied Transport: Variational Multiscale Moment Methods for the Boltzmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows relative to a given kinetic model by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data for the Shakhov model as well as Monte Carlo Simulations and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in close alignment with the underlying kinetic models, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>Propulsion and interaction of wave-propelled interfacial particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a floating body is internally or externally vibrated, its self-generated wavefield can lead to steady propulsion along the interface. In this article, we review several related and recently discovered systems that leverage this propulsion mechanism and interact hydrodynamically with one another via these surface waves. Particles with an onboard oscillatory driver may self-propel by virtue of a fore-aft asymmetric wavefield, a phenomenon with demonstrated relevance to biological and artificial systems across scales. Freely floating particles on a vibrated fluid bath can also self-propel along straight paths, but may also rotate in place or move along curved arcs, depending sensitively on the particle asymmetries and driving parameters. Such surfing particles interact at a distance through their mutual capillary wavefield and exhibit a rich array of collective dynamics. Overall, these accessible, tunable, and visually appealing systems motivate future investigations into a number of outstanding questions in fundamental fluid mechanics, while potentially also informing advances in the fields of active matter, hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and robotics.</description>

      <title>When Cubic Law and Darcy Fail: Bayesian Correction of Model Misspecification in Fracture Conductivities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural uncertainties and unresolved features in fault zones hinder the assessment of leakage risks in subsurface CO2 storage. Understanding multi-scale uncertainties in fracture network conductivity is crucial for mitigating risks and reliably modelling upscaled fault leakage rates. Conventional models, such as the Cubic Law, which is based on mechanical aperture measurements, often neglect fracture roughness, leading to model misspecifications and inaccurate conductivity estimates. Here, we develop a physics-informed, AI-driven correction of these model misspecifications by automatically integrating roughness effects and small-scale structural uncertainties. Using Bayesian inference combined with data-driven and geometric corrections, we reconstruct local hydraulic aperture fields that reliably estimate fracture conductivities. By leveraging interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections and provide a framework for propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales. Our approach thereby supports robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, offering a scalable solution for subsurface risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Exchange between Nanoparticles Heated by Arc Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heating of particles by plasma radiation plays a critical role in space science involving dusty plasma as well as in industrial processes such as plasma vapor deposition, microchip production, etching and plasma fusion. Numerical modeling of radiation heat transfer from plasma to nano-scale particles includes exchange of scattered thermal radiation between particles-an effect that was neglected in prior studies in which temperature of particles was estimated. Thermal modeling of gas loaded with nanoparticles differs from a typical multiphase flow, where particles are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas. In contrast, the temperature of nanoparticles heated by radiation is significantly higher than the local gas temperature. The nanoparticles volume heating by radiation is markedly different from conventional surface heating experience by macroscale particles. The larger particles are heated to higher temperatures than smaller ones. The study includes numerical modeling of thermal radiation scattered by particles in the Rayleigh regime in where particles radii are much smaller compared to the radiation wavelength and the distance between particles is larger than the dominant radiation wavelength. The study investigates the effects of reduction in conduction heat flux by reducing the gas pressure and using alternating noble gases. Additionally, it investigates the role of enhancement of radiation heat flux from the arc. The computational results show that the re-radiation by larger, heated nanoparticles is important to obtain the accurate temperature of particles. This inter-particle thermal interaction leads to higher temperatures in smaller particles than models assuming thermally isolated particles would predict.</description>
