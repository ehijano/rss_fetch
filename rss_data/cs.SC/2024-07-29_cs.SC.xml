      <title>Equality of morphic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morphic sequences form a natural class of infinite sequences, typically defined as the coding of a fixed point of a morphism. Different morphisms and codings may yield the same morphic sequence. This paper investigates how to prove that two such representations of a morphic sequence by morphisms represent the same sequence. In particular, we focus on the smallest representations of the subsequences of the binary Fibonacci sequence obtained by only taking the even or odd elements. The proofs we give are induction proofs of several properties simultaneously, and are typically found fully automatically by a tool that we developed.</description>

      <title>Certified simultaneous isotopic approximation of curves via subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm based on subdivision for computing an isotopic approximation to any number of curves in the plane. Our algorithm is based on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter. The main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify and isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of our output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves is to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the details of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the number of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case bounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.</description>
