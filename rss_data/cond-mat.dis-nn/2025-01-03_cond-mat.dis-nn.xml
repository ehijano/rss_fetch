      <title>The simplest spin glass revisited: finite-size effects of the energy landscape can modify aging dynamics in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random energy model is one of the few glass models whose asymptotic activated aging dynamics are solvable. However, the existing aging theory, i.e., Bouchaud's trap model, does not agree with dynamical simulation results obtained in finite-sized systems. Here we show that this discrepancy originates from non-negligible finite-size corrections in the energy barrier distributions. The finite-size effects add a logarithmic decay term in the time-correlation aging function, which destroys the asymptotic large-time plateau predicted by Bouchaud's trap model in the spin glass phase. Surprisingly, the finite-size effects also give corrections, preserved even in the thermodynamic limit, to the value of the asymptotic plateau. It results in an unexpected dynamical transition where weak ergodicity breaking occurs, at a temperature $T_{\rm d}$ above the thermodynamic spin-glass transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Based on the barrier distributions obtained by a numerical barrier-tree method and an expansion theory, we propose a generalized trap model to incorporate such finite-size effects. The theoretically derived aging behavior of the generalized trap model explains the Monte-Carlo dynamical simulation data of random energy models with Gaussian and exponential random energies. Our results suggest that the double limits of large system size and long time are not interchangeable for the activated aging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics and Cyclic Memory Retrieval in Non-reciprocal Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how these networks could model biological processes near a critical threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step transitions.</description>

      <title>On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. There is a widespread belief that this statement implies an exponential scaling, $\sim 2^{N/\beta}$, of necessary computational efforts (classical or quantum), with the number of spins, $N$. Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. We provide a theoretical argumentation for this observation based on statistical analysis of low energy states.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Efficient training of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAl validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials play a vital role in revealing microscopic details and structure-property relations, which are fundamental for multiscale simulations and to assist high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to the complexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result, chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class of materials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing an efficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with the widely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogate model with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades of supercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficient training of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum of energies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initio optimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP shows results comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) available for CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanical properties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and high entropy metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Modulational Instability and Dynamical Growth Blockade in the Nonlinear Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hatano-Nelson model is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics, describing asymmetric hopping dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, which gives rise to fascinating phenomena such as directional transport, non-Hermitian topology, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. It has been widely studied in both classical and quantum systems, with applications in condensed matter physics, photonics, and cold atomic gases. Recently, nonlinear extensions of the Hatano-Nelson model have opened a new avenue for exploring the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermitian effects. Particularly, in lattices with open boundary conditions, nonlinear skin modes and solitons, localized at the edge or within the bulk of the lattice, have been predicted. In this work, we examine the nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and reveal a novel dynamical phenomenon arising from the modulational instability of nonlinear plane waves: growth blockade. This phenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in the linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of convective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.</description>

      <title>Representing arbitrary ground states of toric code by a restricted Boltzmann machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Slow dissipation and spreading in disordered classical systems: A direct comparison between numerics and mathematical bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena. Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration, and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully gapped and time-reversal symmetric quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies, accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and the bulk. The advent of moir\'e materials and a variety of quantum simulators provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to life in a controlled fashion.</description>

Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the single-particle sector exhibits chaotic dynamics. We study the corresponding many-body spectral statistics and show that the spectral form factor (SFF) can be computed \textit{exactly}. Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>
