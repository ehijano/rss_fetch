      <title>Portfolio selection with exogenous and endogenous transaction costs under a two-factor stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a portfolio selection problem with transaction costs under a two-factor stochastic volatility structure, where volatility follows a mean-reverting process with a stochastic mean-reversion level. The model incorporates both proportional exogenous transaction costs and endogenous costs modeled by a stochastic liquidity risk process. Using an option-implied approach, we extract an S-shaped utility function that reflects investor behavior and apply its concave envelope transformation to handle the non-concavity. The resulting problem reduces to solving a five-dimensional nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We employ a deep learning-based policy iteration scheme to numerically compute the value function and the optimal policy. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze how both types of transaction costs and stochastic volatility affect optimal investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Jump risk premia in the presence of clustered jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an option pricing model that incorporates clustered jumps using a bivariate Hawkes process. The process captures both self- and cross-excitation of positive and negative jumps, enabling the model to generate return dynamics with asymmetric, time-varying skewness and to produce positive or negative implied volatility skews. This feature is especially relevant for assets such as cryptocurrencies, so-called ``meme'' stocks, G-7 currencies, and certain commodities, where implied volatility skews may change sign depending on prevailing sentiment. We introduce two additional parameters, namely the positive and negative jump premia, to model the market risk preferences for positive and negative jumps, inferred from options data. This enables the model to flexibly match observed skew dynamics. Using Bitcoin (BTC) options, we empirically demonstrate how inferred jump risk premia exhibit predictive power for both the cost of carry in BTC futures and the performance of delta-hedged option strategies.</description>

      <title>Goal-based portfolio selection with fixed transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a goal-based portfolio selection problem in which an investor aims to meet multiple financial goals, each with a specific deadline and target amount. Trading the stock incurs a strictly positive transaction cost. Using the stochastic Perron's method, we show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to a system of quasi-variational inequalities. The existence of an optimal trading strategy and goal funding scheme is established. Numerical results reveal complex optimal trading regions and show that the optimal investment strategy differs substantially from the V-shaped strategy observed in the frictionless case.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping and divestment timing under scenario ambiguity and learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming to analyze the impact of environmental transition on the value of assets and on asset stranding, we study optimal stopping and divestment timing decisions for an economic agent whose future revenues depend on the realization of a scenario from a given set of possible futures. Since the future scenario is unknown and the probabilities of individual prospective scenarios are ambiguous, we adopt the smooth model of decision making under ambiguity aversion of Klibanoff et al (2005), framing the optimal divestment decision as an optimal stopping problem with learning under ambiguity aversion. We then prove a minimax result reducing this problem to a series of standard optimal stopping problems with learning. The theory is illustrated with two examples: the problem of optimally selling a stock with ambiguous drift, and the problem of optimal divestment from a coal-fired power plant under transition scenario ambiguity.</description>
