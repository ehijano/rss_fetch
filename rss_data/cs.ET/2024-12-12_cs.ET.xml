      <title>Toward an Ion-Based Large-Scale Integrated Circuit: Circuit Level Design, Simulation, and Integration of Iontronic Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iontronics combines ions as charge carriers with electronic-like operations, enabling unique information processing, chemical regulation, and enhanced bio-integrability. Standard simulation tools encounter difficulties in effectively modeling the behavior of integrated iontronic components, highlighting the need for specialized design and simulation approaches. This paper presents a design methodology for iontronic integrated circuits, inspired by well-established electronic design methodologies and made possible by the development of a compact model for the iontronic bipolar diode. Grounded in the diode's physical properties and observed behavior, this model provides a conceptual framework that could be applied to other iontronic components. It is implemented using standard VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) electronic design tools, enabling simulations that demonstrate diode-based iontronic circuit behaviors and laying the groundwork for the design and simulation of hybrid systems integrating electronic and iontronic circuits. The proposed iontronic circuit simulation approach enables the exploration of how component uniformity influences circuit behavior, as well as the impact of diode parameters and a deeper understanding of diode characteristics from a circuit perspective. These insights are expected to contribute to the development of more complex and efficient iontronic circuits, bringing us closer to practical and groundbreaking applications in the field.</description>

      <title>Non-binary dynamical Ising machines for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines achieve accelerated solving of complex combinatorial optimization problems by remapping the convergence to the ground state of the classical spin networks to the evolution of specially constructed continuous dynamical systems. The main adapted principle of constructing such systems is based on requiring that, on the one hand, the system converges to a binary state and, on the other hand, the system's energy in such states mimics the classical Ising Hamiltonian. The emergence of binary-like states is regarded to be an indispensable feature of dynamical Ising machines as it establishes the relation between the machine's continuous terminal state and the inherently discrete solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. This is emphasized by problems where the unknown quantities are represented by spin complexes, for example, the graph coloring problem. In such cases, an imprecise mapping of the continuous states to spin configurations may lead to invalid solutions requiring intensive post-processing. In contrast to such an approach, we show that there exists a class of non-binary dynamical Ising machines without the incongruity between the continuous character of the machine's states and the discreteness of the spin states. We demonstrate this feature by applying such a machine to the problems of finding proper graph coloring, constructing Latin squares, and solving Sudoku puzzles. Thus, we demonstrate that the information characterizing discrete states can be unambiguously presented in essentially continuous dynamical systems. This opens new opportunities in the realization of scalable electronic accelerators of combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in California Electricity Price Forecasting: Enhancing Accuracy and Reliability Using Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting has significant practical implications for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. This study focuses on enhancing electricity price forecasting in California's grid, addressing challenges from complex generation data and heteroskedasticity. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA), we analyze CAISO's hourly electricity prices and demand from 2016-2021 to improve day-ahead forecasting accuracy. Initially, we apply traditional outlier analysis with the interquartile range method, followed by robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier elimination. This approach improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. We then construct multiple linear regression models using both raw and PCA-transformed features. The model with transformed features, refined through traditional and SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal methods, shows superior forecasting performance. The SAS Sparse Matrix method, in particular, significantly enhances model accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based methods are key in advancing electricity price forecasting, supporting renewable integration and grid management in day-ahead markets.
  Keywords: Electricity price forecasting, principal component analysis (PCA), power system planning, heteroskedasticity, renewable energy integration.</description>

      <title>Pattern Tree: Enhancing Efficiency in Quantum Circuit Optimization Based on Pattern-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit optimization is essential for improving the performance of quantum algorithms, particularly on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices with limited qubit connectivity and high error rates. Pattern matching has proven to be an effective technique for identifying and optimizing subcircuits by replacing them with functionally equivalent, efficient versions, including reducing circuit depth and facilitating platform portability. However, existing approaches face challenges in handling large-scale circuits and numerous transformation rules, often leading to redundant matches and increased compilation time. In this study, we propose a novel framework for quantum circuit optimization based on pattern matching to enhance its efficiency. Observing redundancy in applying existing transformation rules, our method employs a pattern tree structure to organize these rules, reducing redundant operations during the execution of the pattern-matching algorithm and improving matching efficiency. We design and implement a compilation framework to demonstrate the practicality of the pattern tree approach. Experimental results show that pattern-tree-based pattern matching can reduce execution time by an average of 20% on a well-accepted benchmark set. Furthermore, we analyze how to build a pattern tree to maximize the optimization of compilation time. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach has the potential to optimize compilation time by 90%.</description>

      <title>Overview of Web Application Performance Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its thirty years of existence, the World Wide Web has helped to transform the world and create digital economies. Although it started as a global information exchange, it has become the most significant available application platform on top of its initial target. One of the side effects of this evolution was perhaps suboptimal ways to deliver content over the web, leading to wasted resources and business through lost conversions. Technically speaking, there are many ways to improve the performance of web applications. In this article, we examine the currently available options and the latest trends related to improving web application performance.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chaotic Systems with Quantum Echo-state Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial neural networks have enabled impressive tasks on classical computers, but they demand significant computational resources. While quantum computing offers potential beyond classical systems, the advantages of quantum neural networks (QNNs) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present and examine a quantum circuit (QC) that implements and aims to improve upon the classical echo-state network (ESN), a type of reservoir-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), using quantum computers. Typically, ESNs consist of an extremely large reservoir that learns high-dimensional embeddings, enabling prediction of complex system trajectories. Quantum echo-state networks (QESNs) aim to reduce this need for prohibitively large reservoirs by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers, potentially allowing for more efficient and higher performing time-series prediction algorithms. The proposed QESN can be implemented on any digital quantum computer implementing a universal gate set, and does not require any sort of stopping or re-initialization of the circuit, allowing continuous evolution of the quantum state over long time horizons. We conducted simulated QC experiments on the chaotic Lorenz system, both with noisy and noiseless models, to demonstrate the circuit's performance and its potential for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical encoding enabled by recurrent linear scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical information processing and computing can potentially offer enhanced performance, scalability and energy efficiency. However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</description>

      <title>Shaping AI's Impact on Billions of Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</description>
