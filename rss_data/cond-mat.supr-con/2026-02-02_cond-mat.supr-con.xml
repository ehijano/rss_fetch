      <title>Electronic Origin of Density Wave Orders in a Trilayer Nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has established a new frontier in the study of high-temperature superconductors. However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family.</description>

      <title>Infinite Magnetoresistance and Vortex Coupling in the Pb/BSCCO Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining superconductivity with spintronics provides exciting opportunities to realize low-dissipation quantum devices. Here we report the synthesis, characterization and magnetotransport measurements of the Pb/Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) superconducting heterostructures, where an insulating PbO$_{x}$ layer spontaneously forms at the interface. Non-volatile switching between superconducting (logical "0") and normal ("1") states in Pb films by an external field, i.e., infinite magnetoresistance (IMR), can be realized and are attributed to the strong trapping and pinning of vortices in BSCCO. Furthermore, butterfly-shaped hysteresis loops in magnetoresistance, pronounced resistance dips/jumps and thermal reset to superconducting states can be observed and are direct manifestations of the peculiar vortex dynamics in BSCCO and vortex coupling across the Pb/BSCCO interface. Our work demonstrates a simple and effective way to realize IMR through superconducting vortices and opens up new opportunities to study the vortex interactions across the superconducting interfaces.</description>

      <title>Theory of Little-Parks oscillations by vortices in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Little-Parks (LP) effect is a quantum phenomenon in which the superconducting transition temperature of a superconducting cylinder (or ring) oscillates periodically as a function of the magnetic flux threading the loop. Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $\pi$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $\pi$-rings.</description>

      <title>Andreev spin qubits based on the helical edge states of magnetically doped two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Andreev spin qubits can be realized in a Josephson junction based on the helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator (quantum spin Hall system) proximized by superconducting films, in the presence of magnetic doping. We demonstrate that the electrical dipole transitions between the Andreev spin states induced by the magnetic doping can be harnessed to optically manipulate the Andreev spin qubit by microwave radiation pulses. We numerically simulate the realization of NOT and Hadamard quantum logic gates, and discuss implementations in realistic setups.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in a superconducting qubit at odd parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics of the Josephson effect is the core ingredient for quantum technologies with superconducting circuits. A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime. Our prediction could be tested in forthcoming experiments with superconductor/semiconductor/superconductor junctions, which have been studied intensively in recent years, both using nanowires as well as two-dimensional electron gases.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>
