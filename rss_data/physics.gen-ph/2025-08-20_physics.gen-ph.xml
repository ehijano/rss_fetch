      <title>Topological Regularization of 1 Loop and 2 Loop Gravitational Corrections in the Higgs Fermion Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents topological regularization (TR), a geometric framework for controlling ultraviolet divergences in gravitational loop corrections to the Higgs fermion sector. The method embeds flat spacetime into a compact four dimensional manifold, introducing a curvature induced high energy cutoff that preserves both Lorentz invariance and causality. The regulator is determined by the manifold's Euler characteristic, ensuring power law suppression of short distance modes without breaking spacetime symmetries. Applied to one and two loop processes, TR yields finite corrections to fermion self energies, Yukawa couplings, and curvature dependent operators, with leading contributions set entirely by topological properties. Beyond its role as a regulator, TR naturally encodes a duality between ultraviolet and infrared scales and admits a thermal interpretation linked to the Unruh effect. While the framework is universal in principle, its current implementation relies on a spherical embedding and has been tested only in the soft graviton limit. The predicted signals are highly suppressed, posing experimental challenges, yet TR offers a symmetry preserving path toward probing Planck-scale physics within effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Spinors and $Z_2$ Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hodge theorem and harmonic spinors are studied in a physics-oriented approach in the present paper. New mathematical results on the harmonic spinors are as follows. Harmonic spinors defined by partial differential operators could be of two types: trivial without topological defects, and having nontrivial topological structures, for example, phase singularities or phase vortices. There could exist a nontrivial harmonic vector field associated with nontrivial harmonic spinor, for example, ${\bf v}_{vortex}$ associated with Weyl 2-spinor. The $Z_2$-vortex is re-visited in the perspective of harmonic spinors leading to a remarkable result that the gauge potential is exactly the same as the nontrivial harmonic vector field associated with the 2-spinor. It is proposed that a discrete symmetry group $SL(2, Z)$ has a role in connection with the continuous group $SU(2)$ similar to the discrete group $Z_2$ in $U(1)$.</description>
