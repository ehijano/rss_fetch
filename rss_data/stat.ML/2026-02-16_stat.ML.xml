      <title>Linear Regression with Unknown Truncation Beyond Gaussian Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In truncated linear regression, samples $(x,y)$ are shown only when the outcome $y$ falls inside a certain survival set $S^\star$ and the goal is to estimate the unknown $d$-dimensional regressor $w^\star$. This problem has a long history of study in Statistics and Machine Learning going back to the works of (Galton, 1897; Tobin, 1958) and more recently in, e.g., (Daskalakis et al., 2019; 2021; Lee et al., 2023; 2024). Despite this long history, however, most prior works are limited to the special case where $S^\star$ is precisely known. The more practically relevant case, where $S^\star$ is unknown and must be learned from data, remains open: indeed, here the only available algorithms require strong assumptions on the distribution of the feature vectors (e.g., Gaussianity) and, even then, have a $d^{\mathrm{poly} (1/\varepsilon)}$ run time for achieving $\varepsilon$ accuracy.
  In this work, we give the first algorithm for truncated linear regression with unknown survival set that runs in $\mathrm{poly} (d/\varepsilon)$ time, by only requiring that the feature vectors are sub-Gaussian. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine for efficiently learning unions of a bounded number of intervals using access to positive examples (without any negative examples) under a certain smoothness condition. This learning guarantee adds to the line of works on positive-only PAC learning and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Regularization-Sharpness Tradeoff for Linear Interpolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rule of thumb regarding the relationship between the bias-variance tradeoff and model size plays a key role in classical machine learning, but is now well-known to break down in the overparameterized setting as per the double descent curve. In particular, minimum-norm interpolating estimators can perform well, suggesting the need for new tradeoff in these settings. Accordingly, we propose a regularization-sharpness tradeoff for overparameterized linear regression with an $\ell^p$ penalty. Inspired by the interpolating information criterion, our framework decomposes the selection penalty into a regularization term (quantifying the alignment of the regularizer and the interpolator) and a geometric sharpness term on the interpolating manifold (quantifying the effect of local perturbations), yielding a tradeoff analogous to bias-variance. Building on prior analyses that established this information criterion for ridge regularizers, this work first provides a general expression of the interpolating information criterion for $\ell^p$ regularizers where $p \ge 2$. Subsequently, we extend this to the LASSO interpolator with $\ell^1$ regularizer, which induces stronger sparsity. Empirical results on real-world datasets with random Fourier features and polynomials validate our theory, demonstrating how the tradeoff terms can distinguish performant linear interpolators from weaker ones.</description>

      <title>Blessings of Multiple Good Arms in Multi-Objective Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi objective bandit setting has traditionally been regarded as more complex than the single objective case, as multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. In contrast to this prevailing view, we demonstrate that when multiple good arms exist for multiple objectives, they can induce a surprising benefit, implicit exploration. Under this condition, we show that simple algorithms that greedily select actions in most rounds can nonetheless achieve strong performance, both theoretically and empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce implicit exploration in both multi objective and parametric bandit settings without any distributional assumptions on the contexts. We further introduce a framework for effective Pareto fairness, which provides a principled approach to rigorously analyzing fairness of multi objective bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>Annealing in variational inference mitigates mode collapse: A theoretical study on Gaussian mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode collapse, the failure to capture one or more modes when targetting a multimodal distribution, is a central challenge in modern variational inference. In this work, we provide a mathematical analysis of annealing based strategies for mitigating mode collapse in a tractable setting: learning a Gaussian mixture, where mode collapse is known to arise. Leveraging a low dimensional summary statistics description, we precisely characterize the interplay between the initial temperature and the annealing rate, and derive a sharp formula for the probability of mode collapse. Our analysis shows that an appropriately chosen annealing scheme can robustly prevent mode collapse. Finally, we present numerical evidence that these theoretical tradeoffs qualitatively extend to neural network based models, RealNVP normalizing flows, providing guidance for designing annealing strategies mitigating mode collapse in practical variational inference pipelines.</description>

      <title>TFTF: Training-Free Targeted Flow for Conditional Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a training-free conditional sampling method for flow matching models based on importance sampling. Because a na\"ive application of importance sampling suffers from weight degeneracy in high-dimensional settings, we modify and incorporate a resampling technique in sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) during intermediate stages of the generation process. To encourage generated samples to diverge along distinct trajectories, we derive a stochastic flow with adjustable noise strength to replace the deterministic flow at the intermediate stage. Our framework requires no additional training, while providing theoretical guarantees of asymptotic accuracy. Experimentally, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches on conditional sampling tasks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in higher-dimensional, multimodal settings through text-to-image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ.</description>

      <title>Random Forests as Statistical Procedures: Design, Variance, and Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random forests are widely used prediction procedures, yet are typically described algorithmically rather than as statistical designs acting on a fixed dataset. We develop a finite-sample, design-based formulation of random forests in which each tree is an explicit randomized conditional regression function. This perspective yields an exact variance identity for the forest predictor that separates finite-aggregation variability from a structural dependence term that persists even under infinite aggregation. We further decompose both single-tree dispersion and inter-tree covariance using the laws of total variance and covariance, isolating two fundamental design mechanisms-reuse of training observations and alignment of data-adaptive partitions. These mechanisms induce a strict covariance floor, demonstrating that predictive variability cannot be eliminated by increasing the number of trees alone. The resulting framework clarifies how resampling, feature-level randomization, and split selection govern resolution, tree variability, and dependence, and establishes random forests as explicit finite-sample statistical designs whose behavior is determined by their underlying randomized construction.</description>

      <title>AdaGrad-Diff: A New Version of the Adaptive Gradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanilla gradient methods are often highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize, which typically requires manual tuning. Adaptive methods alleviate this issue and have therefore become widely used. Among them, AdaGrad has been particularly influential. In this paper, we propose an AdaGrad-style adaptive method in which the adaptation is driven by the cumulative squared norms of successive gradient differences rather than gradient norms themselves. The key idea is that when gradients vary little across iterations, the stepsize is not unnecessarily reduced, while significant gradient fluctuations, reflecting curvature or instability, lead to automatic stepsize damping. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust than AdaGrad in several practically relevant settings.</description>

      <title>Computationally sufficient statistics for Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\ell_1$ width $\gamma$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\gamma)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields. We also discuss a setting where prior information about structure of the model is available and show that the learning problem can be solved efficiently with even more limited observational power.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based CoVaR: Systemic Risk in Textual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) quantifies systemic financial risk by measuring the loss quantile of one asset, conditional on another asset experiencing distress. We develop a Transformer-based methodology that integrates financial news articles directly with market data to improve CoVaR estimates. Unlike approaches that use predefined sentiment scores, our method incorporates raw text embeddings generated by a large language model (LLM). We prove explicit error bounds for our Transformer CoVaR estimator, showing that accurate CoVaR learning is possible even with small datasets. Using U.S. market returns and Reuters news items from 2006--2013, our out-of-sample results show that textual information impacts the CoVaR forecasts. With better predictive performance, we identify a pronounced negative dip during market stress periods across several equity assets when comparing the Transformer-based CoVaR to both the CoVaR without text and the CoVaR using traditional sentiment measures. Our results show that textual data can be used to effectively model systemic risk without requiring prohibitively large data sets.</description>

      <title>HyperMLP: An Integrated Perspective for Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Two-Stage Empirical Risk Minimization and Applications to Individualized Treatment Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for deriving privacy-preserving estimators by injecting calibrated noise to mask individual contributions while preserving population-level insights. Its central challenge lies in the privacy-utility trade-off: calibrating noise levels to ensure robust protection without compromising statistical performance. Standard DP methods struggle with a particular class of two-stage problems prevalent in individualized treatment rules (ITRs) and causal inference. In these settings, data-dependent weights are first computed to satisfy distributional constraints, such as covariate balance, before the final parameter of interest is estimated. Current DP approaches often privatize stages independently, which either degrades weight efficacy-leading to biased and inconsistent estimates-or introduces excessive noise to account for worst-case scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Differentially Private Two-Stage Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-2ERM), a framework that injects a carefully calibrated noise only into the second stage while maintaining privacy for the entire pipeline and preserving the integrity of the first stage weights. Our theoretical contributions include deterministic bounds on weight perturbations across various widely used weighting methods, and probabilistic bounds on sensitivity for the final estimator. Simulations and real-world applications in ITR demonstrate that DP-2ERM significantly enhances utility over existing methods while providing rigorous privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>Unifying Model-Free Efficiency and Model-Based Representations via Latent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Unified Latent Dynamics (ULD), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that unifies the efficiency of model-free methods with the representational strengths of model-based approaches, without incurring planning overhead. By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint. These results indicate that value-aligned latent representations alone can deliver the adaptability and sample efficiency traditionally attributed to full model-based planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM), a class of dynamical generative models, showing that it admits an exact proximal formulation via an extended Brenier potential, without assuming that the target distribution has a density. In particular, the mapping to recover the target point is exactly given by a proximal operator, which yields an explicit proximal expression of the vector field. We also discuss the convergence of minibatch OT-CFM to the population formulation as the batch size increases. Finally, using second epi-derivatives of convex potentials, we prove that, for manifold-supported targets, OT-CFM is terminally normally hyperbolic: after time rescaling, the dynamics contracts exponentially in directions normal to the data manifold while remaining neutral along tangential directions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Federated Granger Causality: From Origins to Systemic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) provides a rigorous framework for learning causal structures from time-series data. Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.</description>

      <title>Diverging Flows: Detecting Extrapolations in Conditional Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of Flow Matching (FM) to model complex conditional distributions has established it as the state-of-the-art for prediction tasks (e.g., robotics, weather forecasting). However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency.

      <title>Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning for Families of Finite-State Mean-Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-state mean-field games (MFGs) arise as limits of large interacting particle systems and are governed by an MFG system, a coupled forward-backward differential equation consisting of a forward Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation describing the population distribution and a backward Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation defining the value function. Solving MFG systems efficiently is challenging, with the structure of each system depending on an initial distribution of players and the terminal cost of the game. We propose an operator learning framework that solves parametric families of MFGs, enabling generalization without retraining for new initial distributions and terminal costs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error, parametric complexity, and generalization performance of our method, based on a novel regularity result for an appropriately defined flow map corresponding to an MFG system. We demonstrate empirically that our framework achieves accurate approximation for two representative instances of MFGs: a cybersecurity example and a high-dimensional quadratic model commonly used as a benchmark for numerical methods for MFGs.</description>

      <title>Profiling systematic uncertainties in Simulation-Based Inference with Factorizable Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unbinned likelihood fits aim at maximizing the information one can extract from experimental data, yet their application in realistic statistical analyses is often hindered by the computational cost of profiling systematic uncertainties. Additionally, current machine learning-based inference methods are typically limited to estimating scalar parameters in a multidimensional space rather than full differential distributions. We propose a general framework for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) that efficiently profiles nuisance parameters while measuring multivariate Distributions of Interest (DoI), defined as learnable invertible transformations of the feature space. We introduce Factorizable Normalizing Flows to model systematic variations as parametric deformations of a nominal density, preserving tractability without combinatorial explosion. Crucially, we develop an amortized training strategy that learns the conditional dependence of the DoI on nuisance parameters in a single optimization process, bypassing the need for repetitive training during the likelihood scan. This allows for the simultaneous extraction of the underlying distribution and the robust profiling of nuisances. The method is validated on a synthetic dataset emulating a high-energy physics measurement with multiple systematic sources, demonstrating its potential for unbinned, functional measurements in complex analyses.</description>

      <title>AutoLL: Automatic Linear Layout of Graphs based on Deep Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear layouts are a graph visualization method that can be used to capture an entry pattern in an adjacency matrix of a given graph. By reordering the node indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge of latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to find an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given matrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features to use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always available. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven feature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix is preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called DeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a two-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and it cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used for reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its model architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode linear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural network models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected networks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models have specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an observed adjacency matrix. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed approach, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary applications, such as recommendation systems and mobile health monitoring, require real-time processing and analysis of sequentially arriving high-dimensional tensor data. Traditional offline learning, involving the storage and utilization of all data in each computational iteration, becomes impractical for these tasks. Furthermore, existing low-rank tensor methods lack the capability for online statistical inference, which is essential for real-time predictions and informed decision-making. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel online inference framework for low-rank tensors. Our approach employs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to enable efficient real-time data processing without extensive memory requirements. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence result for the online low-rank SGD estimator, nearly matches the minimax optimal estimation error rate of offline models. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful online debiasing approach for sequential statistical inference. The entire online procedure, covering both estimation and inference, eliminates the need for data splitting or storing historical data, making it suitable for on-the-fly hypothesis testing. In our analysis, we control the sum of constructed super-martingales to ensure estimates along the entire solution path remain within the benign region. Additionally, a novel spectral representation tool is employed to address statistical dependencies among iterative estimates, establishing the desired asymptotic normality.</description>

      <title>Towards Representation Learning for Weighting Problems in Design-Based Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reweighting a distribution to minimize a distance to a target distribution is a powerful and flexible strategy for estimating a wide range of causal effects, but can be challenging in practice because optimal weights typically depend on knowledge of the underlying data generating process. In this paper, we focus on design-based weights, which do not incorporate outcome information; prominent examples include prospective cohort studies, survey weighting, and the weighting portion of augmented weighting estimators. In such applications, we explore the central role of representation learning in finding desirable weights in practice. Unlike the common approach of assuming a well-specified representation, we highlight the error due to the choice of a representation and outline a general framework for finding suitable representations that minimize this error. Building on recent work that combines balancing weights and neural networks, we propose an end-to-end estimation procedure that learns a flexible representation, while retaining promising theoretical properties. We show that this approach is competitive in a range of common causal inference tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian phylogenetics is vital for understanding evolutionary dynamics, and requires accurate and efficient approximation of posterior distributions over trees. In this work, we develop a variational Bayesian approach for ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We present a novel variational family based on coalescent times of a single-linkage clustering and derive a closed-form density for the resulting distribution over trees. Unlike existing methods for ultrametric trees, our method performs inference over all of tree space, it does not require any Markov chain Monte Carlo subroutines, and our variational family is differentiable. Through experiments on benchmark genomic datasets and an application to the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy while requiring significantly fewer gradient evaluations than existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>ROOFS: RObust biOmarker Feature Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection (FS) is essential for biomarker discovery and clinical predictive modeling. Over the past decades, methodological literature on FS has become rich and mature, offering a wide spectrum of algorithmic approaches. However, much of this methodological progress has not fully translated into applied biomedical research. Moreover, challenges inherent in biomedical data, such as high-dimensional feature space, low sample size, multicollinearity, and missing values, make FS non-trivial. To help bridge this gap between methodological development and practical application, we propose ROOFS (RObust biOmarker Feature Selection), a Python package available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/compo/roofs, designed to help researchers in the choice of FS method adapted to their problem. ROOFS benchmarks multiple FS methods on the user's data and generates reports summarizing a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including downstream predictive performance estimated using optimism correction, stability, robustness of individual features, and true positive and false positive rates assessed on semi-synthetic data with a simulated outcome. We demonstrate the utility of ROOFS on data from the PIONeeR clinical trial, aimed at identifying predictors of resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy in lung cancer. Of the 34 FS methods gathered in ROOFS, we evaluated 23 in combination with 11 classifiers (253 models) and identified a filter based on the union of Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate-adjusted p-values from t-test and logistic regression as the optimal approach, outperforming other methods including widely used LASSO. We conclude that comprehensive benchmarking with ROOFS has the potential to improve the reproducibility of FS discoveries and increase the translational value of clinical models.</description>

      <title>The Critical Horizon: Inspection Design Principles for Multi-Stage Operations and Deep Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manufacturing lines, service journeys, supply chains, and AI reasoning chains share a common challenge: attributing a terminal outcome to the intermediate stage that caused it. We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which reliable learning from endpoint data alone requires exponentially many samples. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI.</description>

      <title>Why Agentic Theorem Prover Works: A Statistical Provability Theory of Mathematical Reasoning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic theorem provers -- pipelines that couple a mathematical reasoning model with library retrieval, subgoal-decomposition/search planner, and a proof assistant verifier -- have recently achieved striking empirical success, yet it remains unclear which components drive performance and why such systems work at all despite classical hardness of proof search. We propose a distributional viewpoint and introduce \textbf{statistical provability}, defined as the finite-horizon success probability of reaching a verified proof, averaged over an instance distribution, and formalize modern theorem-proving pipelines as time-bounded MDPs. Exploiting Bellman structure, we prove existence of optimal policies under mild regularity, derive provability certificates via sub-/super-solution inequalities, and bound the performance gap of score-guided planning (greedy/top-\(k\)/beam/rollouts) in terms of approximation error, sequential statistical complexity, representation geometry (metric entropy/doubling structure), and action-gap margin tails. Together, our theory provides a principled, component-sensitive explanation of when and why agentic theorem provers succeed on biased real-world problem distributions, while clarifying limitations in worst-case or adversarial regimes.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Logit Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logit regularization, the addition of a convex penalty directly in logit space, is widely used in modern classifiers, with label smoothing as a prominent example. While such methods often improve calibration and generalization, their mechanism remains under-explored. In this work, we analyze a general class of such logit regularizers in the context of linear classification, and demonstrate that they induce an implicit bias of logit clustering around finite per-sample targets. For Gaussian data, or whenever logits are sufficiently clustered, we prove that logit clustering drives the weight vector to align exactly with Fisher's Linear Discriminant. To demonstrate the consequences, we study a simple signal-plus-noise model in which this transition has dramatic effects: Logit regularization halves the critical sample complexity and induces grokking in the small-noise limit, while making generalization robust to noise. Our results extend the theoretical understanding of label smoothing and highlight the efficacy of a broader class of logit-regularization methods.</description>

      <title>DART: aDaptive Accept RejecT for non-linear top-K subset identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.07687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the bandit problem of selecting $K$ out of $N$ arms at each time step. The reward can be a non-linear function of the rewards of the selected individual arms. The direct use of a multi-armed bandit algorithm requires choosing among $\binom{N}{K}$ options, making the action space large. To simplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits {typically} assume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we prove the lower bound for top-$K$ subset selection with bandit feedback with possibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial setting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the reward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of individual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially finds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is computationally efficient and uses storage linear in $N$. Further, DART achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K\sqrt{KNT})$ for a time horizon $T$, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of $\sqrt{\log{2NT}}$. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization and maximizing the mean of individual rewards, the performance of the proposed algorithm surpasses that of state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that DART significantly outperforms existing methods for both linear and non-linear joint reward environments.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Online Dynamic Assortment with Dual Contextual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As e-commerce expands, delivering real-time personalized recommendations from vast catalogs poses a critical challenge for retail platforms. Maximizing revenue requires careful consideration of both individual customer characteristics and available item features to continuously optimize assortments over time. In this paper, we consider the dynamic assortment problem with dual contexts -- user and item features. In high-dimensional scenarios, the quadratic growth of dimensions complicates computation and estimation. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new low-rank dynamic assortment model to transform this problem into a manageable scale. Then we propose an efficient algorithm that estimates the intrinsic subspaces and utilizes the upper confidence bound approach to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in online decision making. Theoretically, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((d_1+d_2)r\sqrt{T})$, where $d_1, d_2$ represent the dimensions of the user and item features respectively, $r$ is the rank of the parameter matrix, and $T$ denotes the time horizon. This bound represents a substantial improvement over prior literature, achieved by leveraging the low-rank structure. Extensive simulations and an application to the Expedia hotel recommendation dataset further demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &amp; Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when fine-tuning with limited data.

      <title>Deviations from the Nash equilibrium in a two-player optimal execution game with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms in financial trading is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the autonomous nature of these algorithms can lead to unexpected outcomes that deviate from traditional game-theoretical predictions and may even destabilize markets. In this study, we examine a scenario in which two autonomous agents, modelled with Double Deep Q-Learning, learn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact, under the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. We show that the strategies learned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding market impact game. Notably, the learned strategies exhibit supra-competitive solution, {which might be compatible with a tacit collusive behaviour}, closely aligning with the Pareto-optimal solution. We further explore how different levels of market volatility influence the agents' performance and the equilibria they discover, including scenarios where volatility differs between the training and testing phases.</description>

      <title>Generating Physical Dynamics under Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context is challenging, especially when adhering to physical priors expressed in specific equations or formulas. Existing methodologies often overlook the integration of physical priors, resulting in violation of basic physical laws and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates physical priors into diffusion-based generative models to address this limitation. Our approach leverages two categories of priors: 1) distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and 2) physical feasibility priors, including energy and momentum conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, our method can efficiently generate physically realistic dynamics, encompassing trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method produces high-quality dynamics across a diverse array of physical phenomena with remarkable robustness, underscoring its potential to advance data-driven studies in AI4Physics. Our contributions signify a substantial advancement in the field of generative modeling, offering a robust solution to generate accurate and physically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measure-to-measure interpolation using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are deep neural network architectures that underpin the recent successes of large language models. Unlike more classical architectures that can be viewed as point-to-point maps, a Transformer acts as a measure-to-measure map implemented as specific interacting particle system on the unit sphere: the input is the empirical measure of tokens in a prompt and its evolution is governed by the continuity equation. In fact, Transformers are not limited to empirical measures and can in principle process any input measure. As the nature of data processed by Transformers is expanding rapidly, it is important to investigate their expressive power as maps from an arbitrary measure to another arbitrary measure. To that end, we provide an explicit choice of parameters that allows a single Transformer to match $N$ arbitrary input measures to $N$ arbitrary target measures, under the minimal assumption that every pair of input-target measures can be matched by some transport map.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Double/Debiased Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). DML is a general approach to performing inference about a target parameter in the presence of nuisance functions: objects that are needed to identify the target parameter but are not of primary interest. Nuisance functions arise naturally in many settings, such as when controlling for confounding variables or leveraging instruments. The paper describes two biases that arise from nuisance function estimation and explains how DML alleviates these biases. Consequently, DML allows the use of flexible methods, including machine learning tools, for estimating nuisance functions, reducing the dependence on auxiliary functional form assumptions and enabling the use of complex non-tabular data, such as text or images. We illustrate the application of DML through simulations and empirical examples. We conclude with a discussion of recommended practices. A companion website includes additional examples with code and references to other resources.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Noisy Manual Labels as Useful Information: An Information Fusion Approach for Enhanced Variable Selection in Penalized Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large-scale supervised learning, penalized logistic regression (PLR) effectively mitigates overfitting through regularization, yet its performance critically depends on robust variable selection. This paper demonstrates that label noise introduced during manual annotation, often dismissed as a mere artifact, can serve as a valuable source of information to enhance variable selection in PLR. We theoretically show that such noise, intrinsically linked to classification difficulty, helps refine the estimation of non-zero coefficients compared to using only ground truth labels, effectively turning a common imperfection into a useful information resource. To efficiently leverage this form of information fusion in large-scale settings where data cannot be stored on a single machine, we propose a novel partition insensitive parallel algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our method ensures that the solution remains invariant to how data is distributed across workers, a key property for reproducible and stable distributed learning, while guaranteeing global convergence at a sublinear rate. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms conventional variable selection techniques in both estimation accuracy and classification performance, affirming the value of intentionally fusing noisy manual labels into the learning process.</description>

      <title>N$^2$: A Unified Python Package and Test Bench for Nearest Neighbor-Based Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor (NN) methods have re-emerged as competitive tools for matrix completion, offering strong empirical performance and recent theoretical guarantees, including entry-wise error bounds, confidence intervals, and minimax optimality. Despite their simplicity, recent work has shown that NN approaches are robust to a range of missingness patterns and effective across diverse applications. This paper introduces N$^2$, a unified Python package and testbed that consolidates a broad class of NN-based methods through a modular, extensible interface. Built for both researchers and practitioners, N$^2$ supports rapid experimentation and benchmarking. Using this framework, we introduce a new NN variant that achieves state-of-the-art results in several settings. We also release a benchmark suite of real-world datasets, from healthcare and recommender systems to causal inference and LLM evaluation, designed to stress-test matrix completion methods beyond synthetic scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that while classical methods excel on idealized data, NN-based techniques consistently outperform them in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>PeakWeather: MeteoSwiss Weather Station Measurements for Spatiotemporal Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your LLM Web Agent: A Statistical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</description>

      <title>GAGA: Gaussianity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Probability Path based Generative Models (GPPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. Despite state-of-the-art results in 3D molecular generation, their deployment is hindered by the high cost of long generative trajectories, often requiring hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we propose a principled method, named GAGA, to improve generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity of GPPGMs. Our key insight is that different data modalities obtain sufficient Gaussianity at markedly different steps during the forward process. Based on this observation, we analytically identify a characteristic step at which molecular data attains sufficient Gaussianity, after which the trajectory can be replaced by a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing accelerators that coarsen or reformulate trajectories, our approach preserves full-resolution learning dynamics while avoiding redundant transport through truncated distributional states. Experiments on 3D molecular generation benchmarks demonstrate that our GAGA achieves substantial improvement on both generation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>VDW-GNNs: Vector diffusion wavelets for geometric graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce vector diffusion wavelets (VDWs), a novel family of wavelets inspired by the vector diffusion maps algorithm that was introduced to analyze data lying in the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold. We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</description>

      <title>LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>On sample complexity for covariance estimation via the unadjusted Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of a strongly log-concave smooth distribution using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Isomorphism of Transformers: A Lagrangian Approach to Attention Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective field-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer attention through a thermodynamic lens. By constructing a Lagrangian on the information manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, we show that, within the Shannon--Boltzmann entropy framework, the Softmax function arises as a stationary solution minimizing a Helmholtz free energy functional. This establishes a formal correspondence between scaled dot-product attention and canonical ensemble statistics. Extending this mapping to macroscopic observables, we define an effective specific heat associated with fluctuations of the attention energy landscape. In controlled experiments on the modular addition task ($p = 19$--$113$), we observe a robust peak in this fluctuation measure that consistently precedes the onset of generalization. While no asymptotic power-law divergence is detected in this finite-depth regime, the reproducible enhancement of energy variance suggests a critical-like crossover accompanying representational reorganization. Our framework provides a unified statistical-mechanical perspective on attention scaling, training dynamics, and positional encoding, interpreting the phenomena as emergent properties of an effective thermodynamic system rather than isolated heuristics. Although the present results indicate finite-size crossover behavior rather than a strict phase transition, they motivate further investigation into scaling limits of deep architectures through fluctuation-based observables.</description>
