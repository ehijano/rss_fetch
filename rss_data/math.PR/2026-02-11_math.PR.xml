      <title>Hitting Probabilities of Finite Points for One-Dimensional L\'{e}vy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a one-dimensional L\'{e}vy process, we derive an explicit formula for the probability of first hitting a specified point among a fixed finite set. Moreover, using this formula, we obtain an explicit expression for each entry of the $Q$-matrix of the trace process on the finite set. These formulas involve solely the renormalized zero resolvent.</description>

      <title>The Porous Medium Equation: Multiscale Integrability in Large Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a zero-range process $\eta^N_t(x)$ with superlinear local jump rate, which in a hydrodynamic-small particle rescaling converges to the porous medium equation $\partial_t u=\frac12\Delta u^\alpha, \alpha&gt;1$. As a main result we obtain a large deviation principle in any scaling regime of vanishing particle size $\chi_N\to 0$. The key challenge is to develop uniform integrability estimate on the nonlinearity $(\eta^N(x))^\alpha$ in a situation where neither pathwise regularity nor Dirichlet-form based regularity is readily available. We resolve this by introducing a novel multiscale argument exploiting the appearance of pathwise regularity across scales.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of multifractal products of spherical random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies multifractal random measures on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$ constructed via multifractal products of random fields. It presents new limit theorems for multifractal products of spherical fields and conditions for the non-degeneracy of the limiting measure. The multifractal properties of the limiting measure are investigated, and its R\'enyi function is derived. Compared to earlier results on multifractal products of spherical fields, the obtained limit theorems hold under general mixing conditions, enabling the consideration of multifractal products of fields from a broad class and the construction of random measures with flexible multifractal properties.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of transient behavior of finite-capacity MAP-driven queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the workload distribution of a finite-capacity queue driven by a spectrally one-sided Markov additive process (MAP). Our main result provides the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the workload at an exponentially distributed time, thereby uniquely characterizing its transient distribution. The proposed approach combines several decompositions with established fluctuation-theoretic results for spectrally one-sided L\'evy processes. For the special case of Markov-modulated compound Poisson input, we additionally derive results for the idle time and the cumulative amount of lost work. We conclude this paper with a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Geodesic networks and the disjointness gap in the directed landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed landscape is a random directed metric on the plane that arises as the scaling limit of metric models in the KPZ universality class. For a pair of points p, q, the disjointness gap G(p; q) measures the shortfall when we optimize length over pairs of disjoint paths from p to q versus optimizing over all pairs of paths. Any spatial marginal of G is simply the gap between the top two lines in an Airy line ensemble. In this paper, we show that when the start and end time are fixed, the disjointness gap fully encodes the set of exceptional geodesic networks. The correspondence uses simple features of the disjointness gap, e.g. zeroes, local minima. We give a similar correspondence relating semi-infinite geodesic networks to a Busemann gap function. The proofs are deterministic given a list of soft properties related to the coalescent geometry of the directed landscape.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volterra equations with random functional coefficients in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive unique Banach-valued solutions to stochastic Volterra equations with random coefficients that may depend on pure chance and involve singular kernels. In particular, for controlled and distribution-dependent coefficients these solutions become strong, as a measurability analysis of the Wasserstein metric confirms. The presented novel approach is based on the proof that a stochastic Volterra integral admits a progressively measurable modification in a weak sense and on sharp moment estimates for non-negative product measurable processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation of Delay Tail Probabilities in Scheduling and Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating delay tail probabilities in scheduling and load balancing systems is a critical but computationally prohibitive task due to the rarity of violation events. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers a generic quadratic reduction in sample complexity 1/sqrt(p) vs 1/p, but applying it to steady-state queueing networks in challenging: classical simulations involve unbounded state spaces and random regeneration cycles, whereas quantum circuits have fixed depth and finite registers.
  In this paper, we develop a framework for quantum simulation of delay tail probabilities based on truncated regenerative simulation. We show that regenerative rare-event estimators can be reformulated as deterministic, reversible functions of finite random seeds by truncating regeneration cycles. To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error. The proposed framework enables quantum estimation in models with countably infinite state spaces, avoiding the challenge of determining the sufficient mixing time required for direct finite-horizon simulation. We provide bounds on qubit and circuit complexity for a GI-GI-1 queue, a wireless network under MaxWeight scheduling, and a multi-server system with Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation in Orthogonally Invariant Generalized Linear Models: Spectral Initialization and Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation from a generalized linear model with a random design matrix that is orthogonally invariant in law. Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors. Numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of our methods and accuracy of our theory beyond orthogonally invariant data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with homogenization and higher order approximations of solutions to nonlocal evolution equations of convolution type whose coefficients are periodic in the spatial variables and random stationary in time. We assume that the convolution kernel has finite moments up to order three. Under proper mixing assumptions, we study the limit behavior of the normalized difference between solutions of the original and the homogenized problems and show that this difference converges to the solution of a linear stochastic partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for tamed Euler method with coupled monotonicity condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic error distribution of the tamed Euler method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a coupled monotonicity condition, that is, the limit distribution of the corresponding normalized error process. Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $\alpha\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $\alpha\wedge\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $\alpha $ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results.</description>

      <title>The quantum multinomial distribution: a combinatorial formulation of multiphoton interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum generalization of the multinomial distribution for the transition probabilities of $m$ identical photons in a $k$-port linear optical interferometer: two multinomial coefficients (one for the input configuration, one for the output) times the squared modulus of a coherent sum over routing matrices, weighted by the multivariate hypergeometric distribution; no Hilbert space formalism is needed to state or evaluate it. The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the asymptotic behavior in $\beta$-H\"older spaces, and under $L^p$ loss, of the gamma kernel density estimator introduced by Chen [Ann. Inst. Statist. Math. 52 (2000), 471-480] for the analysis of nonnegative data, when the target's support is assumed to be upper bounded. It is shown that this estimator can achieve the minimax rate asymptotically for a suitable choice of bandwidth whenever $(p,\beta)\in [1,3)\times(0,2]$ or $(p,\beta)\in [3,4)\times ((p-3)/(p-2),2]$. It is also shown that this estimator cannot be minimax when either $p\in [4,\infty)$ or $\beta\in (2,\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: The article is devoted to the formulation and proof of the theorem on convergence with probability 1 of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space. The cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonomertic Fourier series are considered in detail. The proof of the mentioned theorem is based on the general properties of multiple Fourier series as well as on the estimate for the fourth moment of approximation error in the method of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series.</description>

      <title>Rough volatility, path-dependent PDEs and weak rates of convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of stochastic Volterra equations, and in particular rough volatility models, we show that conditional expectations are the unique classical solutions to path-dependent PDEs. The latter arise from the functional It\^o formula developed by [Viens, F., &amp; Zhang, J. (2019). A martingale approach for fractional Brownian motions and related path dependent PDEs. Ann. Appl. Probab.]. We then leverage these tools to study weak rates of convergence for discretised stochastic integrals of smooth functions of a Riemann-Liouville fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$. These integrals approximate log-stock prices in rough volatility models. We obtain the optimal weak error rates of order $1$ if the test function is quadratic and of order $(3H+\frac{1}{2})\wedge1$ if the test function is five times differentiable; in particular these conditions are independent of the value of $H$.</description>

  on a separable Hilbert space $H$, where $A\colon H\to H$ is self-adjoint, negative and such that $A^{-1+\beta}$ is of trace class for some $\beta&gt;0$, $b\colon H\to H$ is Lipschitz continuous and $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process on $H$. We denote by $W_A(t)=\int_0^te^{(t-s)A}\,dW(s),\,t\in[0,T],$ the stochastic convolution. We prove, with the help of a formula for nonlinear transformations of Gaussian integrals due to R. Ramer, the following identity $$(P\circ Z_x^{-1})(\Phi) =\int_X\Phi(h+e^{\cdot A}x)\, \exp\left\{ -\tfrac12|\gamma_x(h)|^2_{ H_{Q_T}} + I(\gamma_x)(h)\right\} N_{Q_T}(dh), $$
  where $ N_{Q_T}$ is the law of $W_A$ in $C([0,T],H)$, $ H_{Q_T}$ its Cameron--Martin space, $$ [\gamma_x(k)](t)=\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}b(k(s)+e^{sA}x) ds,\quad t\in[0,T], \; k \in C([0,T],H)
  $$
  and $I(\gamma_x) $ is the It\^o integral of $\gamma_x$. Some applications are discussed; in particular, when $b$ is dissipative we provide an explicit formula for the law of the stationary process and the invariant measure $\nu$ of the Markov semigroup $(P_t)$.
  Some concluding remarks are devoted to a similar problem with colored noise.</description>

      <title>Weak existence for SDEs with singular drifts and fractional Brownian or Levy noise beyond the subcritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional stochastic differential equation with additive noise: \[ d X_t=b(t, X_t) dt +d \xi_t, \] where the drift $b$ is integrable in space and time, and $\xi$ is either a fractional Brownian motion or a L\'evy process. We show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition on integrability indices of $b$, going beyond the subcritical Krylov--R\"ockner (Prodi--Serrin--Ladyzhenskaya) regime. This extends the recent results of Krylov (2020) to the fractional Brownian and L\'evy cases. We also construct a counterexample to demonstrate the optimality of this condition. In the one-dimensional case, we show the existence of a strong solution under the same condition. Our methods are built upon a version of the stochastic sewing lemma of L\^e and the John--Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>Stochastic heterogeneous SIR model with infection-age dependent infectivity on large random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an individual-based stochastic SIR epidemic model with infection-age dependent infectivity on a large random graph, capturing individual heterogeneity and non-homogeneous connectivity. Each individual is associated with particular characteristics (for example, spatial location and age structure), which may not be i.i.d., and is represented by a particular node. The connectivities among the individuals are given by a non-homogeneous random graph, whose connecting probabilities may depend on the individual characteristics of the edge. To each individual is associated a random infectivity function of its infection age, which is allowed to depend upon the individual characteristics. We use measure-valued processes to describe the epidemic evolution dynamics, tracking the infection age of all individuals, and their associated characteristics. We consider the epidemic dynamics as the population size grows to infinity under a specific scaling of the connectivity graph related to the convergence to a graphon. In the limit, we obtain a system of measure-valued equations, which can be also represented as a PDE model on graphon, and reflects the heterogeneities in individual characteristics and social connectivity.</description>

Abstract: Consider the underdamped Langevin process $(q(t),p(t))_{t\geq0}$ in $\R^d\times\R^d$. We derive the low-temperature asymptotic of its mean-transition time between basins of attraction for a double-well potential. This asymptotic is called Eyring-Kramers law and often relies in the literature on Potential theory tools which are ill-defined for hypoelliptic processes like the underdamped Langevin process. In this work, we implement a novel approach which circumvents the use of these traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro population dynamics models of benthic algae with long-memory decay and generic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benthic algae as a primary producer in riverine ecosystems develop biofilms on the riverbed. Their population dynamics involve growth and decay processes, the former owing to the balance between biological proliferation and mortality, while the latter to mechanical abrasion because of the transport of sediment particles. Contrary to the assumptions of previous studies, the decay has experimentally been found to exhibit long-memory behavior, where the population decreases at an algebraic rate. However, the origin and mathematical theory of this phenomenon remain unresolved. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel mathematical model employing spin processes to describe microscopic biofilm dynamics. A spin process is a continuous-time jump process transitioning between states 0 and 1, and the continuum limit of these processes captures the long-memory decay and generates generic growth. The proposed framework leverages heterogeneous spin rates, achieved by appropriately superposing spin processes with distinct rates, to reproduce the long-memory decay. Computational simulations demonstrate the behavior of the model, particularly emphasizing rate-induced tipping phenomena. This mathematical model provides a computationally tractable interpretation of benthic algae dynamics and their long-term prediction, relevant to river-engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Mirzakhani and Petri on random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus, length statistics of closed geodesics have been studied extensively. We focus on the case of random hyperbolic surfaces with cusps, the number of which grows with the genus. We prove that if the number of cusps grows fast enough and we restrict attention to special geodesics that are tight, we recover upon proper normalization the same Poisson point process in the large genus limit for the length statistics. The proof relies on a recursion formula for tight Weil-Petersson volumes obtained recently by Budd and Zonneveld and on a generalization of Mirzakhani's integration formula to the tight setting.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with quadratic nonlinearities close to a change of stability. To this aim we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), observing a change of sign based on the interplay between the distance towards the bifurcation and the noise intensity. A technical challenge is to provide a suitable control of the nonlinear terms coupling the dominant and stable modes of the SPDE and of the corresponding linearization. In order to illustrate our results we apply them to the stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new, relatively simple, line-breaking construction of the $\alpha$-stable tree which realises its random finite-dimensional distributions. This is a direct analogue of Aldous' line-breaking construction of the Brownian continuum random tree, which is based on an inhomogeneous Poisson process. Here, we replace the deterministic rate function from the Brownian setting by a random rate process, given by a certain measure-changed $(\alpha-1)$-stable subordinator. Rather than attaching uniformly, the line-segments now connect to locations chosen with probability proportional to the sizes of the jumps of the rate process.
  We also give a new proof of an invariance principle originally due to Duquesne, which states that the family tree of a Bienaym\'e branching process with critical offspring distribution in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law (for $\alpha \in (1,2))$, conditioned to have $n$ vertices, converges on rescaling distances appropriately to the $\alpha$-stable tree. Our proof makes use of a discrete line-breaking construction of the branching process tree, which we show converges to our continuous line-breaking construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon measure defined on each homotopy class. The energy space decomposes into infinitely many such classes indexed by the topological degree $Q \in \mathbf{Z}$. Even though the sine-Gordon action admits no minimizer in homotopy classes with $|Q| \ge 2$, we prove that the Gibbs measure on each class nevertheless concentrates and exhibits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fluctuations near the multi-soliton manifold in the joint low-temperature and infinite-volume limit. Moreover, we show that soliton collisions are unlikely events, so that typical states consist of solitons separated at an appropriate scale. Finally, we identify the joint distribution of the multi-soliton centers as the ordered statistics of independent uniform random variables, so that each soliton's location follows a Beta distribution.</description>

      <title>The quenched coalescent for structured diploid populations with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes both the mean-field model of Birkner et al. [\textit{Electron. J. Probab.} 23: 1-44 (2018)] and the haploid structured model of M\"{o}hle [\textit{Theor. Popul. Biol.} 2024 Apr:156:103-116]. We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\Psi$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments. Several examples are given and their quenched scaling limits established.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Version of Chung's Lemma and its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chung's Lemma is a classical tool for establishing asymptotic convergence rates of (stochastic) optimization methods under strong convexity-type assumptions and appropriate polynomial diminishing step sizes. In this work, we develop a generalized version of Chung's Lemma, which provides a simple non-asymptotic convergence framework for a more general family of step size rules. We demonstrate broad applicability of the proposed generalized lemma by deriving tight non-asymptotic convergence rates for a large variety of stochastic methods. In particular, we obtain partially new non-asymptotic complexity results for stochastic optimization methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Random Reshuffling (RR), under a general $(\theta,\mu)$-Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition and for various step sizes strategies, including polynomial, constant, exponential, and cosine step sizes rules. Notably, as a by-product of our analysis, we observe that exponential step sizes exhibit superior adaptivity to both landscape geometry and gradient noise; specifically, they achieve optimal convergence rates without requiring exact knowledge of the underlying landscape or separate parameter selection strategies for noisy and noise-free regimes. Our results demonstrate that the developed variant of Chung's Lemma offers a versatile, systematic, and streamlined approach to establish non-asymptotic convergence rates under general step size rules.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with tight boundaries and the Zhukovsky transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider maps with tight boundaries, i.e. maps whose boundaries have minimal length in their homotopy class, and discuss the properties of their generating functions $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ for fixed genus $g$ and prescribed boundary lengths $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, with a control on the degrees of inner faces. We find that these series appear as coefficients in the expansion of $\omega^{(g)}_n(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$, a fundamental quantity in the Eynard-Orantin theory of topological recursion, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of the Zhukovsky transformation used in this context. This interpretation results from the so-called trumpet decomposition of maps with arbitrary boundaries. In the planar bipartite case, we obtain a fully explicit formula for $T^{(0)}_{2\ell_1,\ldots,2\ell_n}$ from the Collet-Fusy formula. We also find recursion relations satisfied by $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$, which consist in adding an extra tight boundary, keeping the genus $g$ fixed. Building on a result of Norbury and Scott, we show that $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ is equal to a parity-dependent quasi-polynomial in $\ell_1^2,\ldots,\ell_n^2$ times a simple power of the basic generating function $R$. In passing, we provide a bijective derivation in the case $(g,n)=(0,3)$, generalizing a recent construction of ours to the non bipartite case.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the fundamental problem of using i.i.d. coin tosses from an entropy source to efficiently generate random variables $X_i \sim P_i$ $(i \ge 1)$, where $(P_1, P_2, \dots)$ is a random sequence of rational discrete probability distributions subject to an \textit{arbitrary} stochastic process. Our method achieves an amortized expected entropy cost within $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ bits of the information-theoretically optimal Shannon lower bound using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space. This result holds both pointwise in terms of the Shannon information content conditioned on $X_i$ and $P_i$, and in expectation to obtain a rate of $\mathbb{E}[H(P_1) + \dots + H(P_n)]/n + \varepsilon$ bits per sample as $n \to \infty$ (where $H$ is the Shannon entropy). The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao (1976) entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi (1997) interval algorithm for online sampling, which require unbounded space. It also uses exponentially less space than the more specialized methods of Kozen and Soloviev (2022) and Shao and Wang (2025) that generate i.i.d. samples from a fixed distribution. Our online sampling algorithm rests on a powerful algorithmic technique called \textit{randomness recycling}, which reuses a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its amortized entropy cost.
  On the practical side, we develop randomness recycling techniques to accelerate a variety of prominent sampling algorithms. We show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, and that it reduces the entropy cost of discrete Gaussian sampling. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Exchangeable Tensors and Matrix-valued Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study concentration inequalities for structured weighted sums of random data, including (i) tensor inner products and (ii) sequential matrix sums. We are interested in tail bounds and concentration inequalities for those structured weighted sums under exchangeability, extending beyond the classical framework of independent terms.
  We develop Hoeffding and Bernstein bounds provided with structure-dependent exchangeability. Along the way, we recover known results in weighted sum of exchangeable random variables and i.i.d. sums of random matrices to the optimal constants. Notably, we develop a sharper concentration bound for combinatorial sum of matrix arrays than the results previously derived from Chatterjee's method of exchangeable pairs.
  For applications, the richer structures provide us with novel analytical tools for estimating the average effect of multi-factor response models and studying fixed-design sketching methods in federated averaging. We apply our results to these problems, and find that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical evidence.</description>
