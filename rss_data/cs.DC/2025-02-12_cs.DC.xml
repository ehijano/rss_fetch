      <title>Analytic Personalized Federated Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic federated learning (AFL) which updates model weights only once by using closed-form least-square (LS) solutions can reduce abundant training time in gradient-free federated learning (FL). The current AFL framework cannot support deep neural network (DNN) training, which hinders its implementation on complex machine learning tasks. Meanwhile, it overlooks the heterogeneous data distribution problem that restricts the single global model from performing well on each client's task. To overcome the first challenge, we propose an AFL framework, namely FedACnnL, in which we resort to a novel local analytic learning method (ACnnL) and model the training of each layer as a distributed LS problem. For the second challenge, we propose an analytic personalized federated meta-learning framework, namely pFedACnnL, which is inherited from FedACnnL. In pFedACnnL, clients with similar data distribution share a common robust global model for fast adapting it to local tasks in an analytic manner. FedACnnL is theoretically proven to require significantly shorter training time than the conventional zeroth-order (i.e. gradient-free) FL frameworks on DNN training while the reduction ratio is $98\%$ in the experiment. Meanwhile, pFedACnnL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) model performance in most cases of convex and non-convex settings, compared with the previous SOTA frameworks.</description>

      <title>Federated Sinkhorn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the potential of solving the discrete Optimal Transport (OT) problem with entropy regularization in a federated learning setting. Recall that the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm transforms the classical OT linear program into strongly convex constrained optimization, facilitating first order methods for otherwise intractably large problems. A common contemporary setting that remains an open problem as far as the application of Sinkhorn is the presence of data spread across clients with distributed inter-communication, either due to clients whose privacy is a concern, or simply by necessity of processing and memory hardware limitations. In this work we investigate various natural procedures, which we refer to as Federated Sinkhorn, that handle distributed environments where data is partitioned across multiple clients. We formulate the problem as minimizing the transport cost with an entropy regularization term, subject to marginal constraints, where block components of the source and target distribution vectors are locally known to clients corresponding to each block. We consider both synchronous and asynchronous variants as well as all-to-all and server-client communication topology protocols. Each procedure allows clients to compute local operations on their data partition while periodically exchanging information with others. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence for the different variants under different possible conditions. We empirically demonstrate the algorithms performance on synthetic datasets and a real-world financial risk assessment application. The investigation highlights the subtle tradeoffs associated with computation and communication time in different settings and how they depend on problem size and sparsity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous case study measured performance vs source-code complexity across multiple languages. The case study identified Chapel and HPX provide similar performance and code complexity. This paper is the result of initial steps toward closing the source-code complexity gap between Chapel and HPX by using a source-to-source compiler. The investigation assesses the single-machine performance of both Chapel and Chplx applications across Arm and x86.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication Advantage for Leader Election and Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on understanding the quantum message complexity of two central problems in distributed computing, namely, leader election and agreement in synchronous message-passing communication networks. We show that quantum communication gives an advantage for both problems by presenting quantum distributed algorithms that significantly outperform their respective classical counterparts under various network topologies.
  While prior works have studied and analyzed quantum distributed algorithms in the context of (improving) round complexity, a key conceptual contribution of our work is positing a framework to design and analyze the message complexity of quantum distributed algorithms. We present and show how quantum algorithmic techniques such as Grover search, quantum counting, and quantum walks can make distributed algorithms significantly message-efficient.
  In particular, our leader election protocol for diameter-2 networks uses quantum walks to achieve the improved message complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such application of quantum walks in distributed computing.</description>

      <title>DSV: Exploiting Dynamic Sparsity to Accelerate Large-Scale Video DiT Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown remarkable performance in modeling and generating high-quality videos. However, the quadratic computational complexity of 3D full attention mechanism presents significant challenges in scaling video DiT training, especially for high-definition and lengthy videos, where attention can dominate up to 95% of the end-to-end time and necessitate specialized communication paradigms to handle large input sizes.
  This paper introduces DSV, a novel framework designed to accelerate and scale the training of video DiTs by leveraging the inherent dynamic attention sparsity throughout the training process. DSV employs a two-stage training algorithm that exploits sparsity patterns, focusing on critical elements supported by efficient, tailored kernels. To accommodate the new sparsity dimension, we develop a hybrid sparsity-aware context parallelism that effectively scales to large inputs by addressing the heterogeneity of sparsity across attention heads and blocks, resulting in optimized sparse computation and communication. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DSV achieves up to 3.02x gain in training throughput with nearly no quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed certification is a set of mechanisms that allows an all-knowing prover to convince the units of a communication network that the network's state has some desired property, such as being 3-colorable or triangle-free. Classical mechanisms, such as proof labeling schemes (PLS), consist of a message from the prover to each unit, followed by one round of communication between each unit and its neighbors. Later works consider extensions, called distributed interactive proofs, where the prover and the units can have multiple rounds of communication before the communication among the units.
  Recently, Bick, Kol, and Oshman (SODA '22) defined a zero-knowledge version of distributed interactive proofs, where the prover convinces the units of the network's state without revealing any other information about the network's state or structure. In their work, they propose different variants of this model and show that many graph properties of interest can be certified with them.
  In this work, we define and study distributed non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (dNIZK); these can be seen as a non-interactive version of the aforementioned model, and also as a zero-knowledge version of PLS. We prove the following:
  - There exists a dNIZK protocol for 3-coloring with O(log n)-bit messages from the prover and O(log n)-size messages among neighbors.
  - There exists a family of dNIZK protocols for triangle-freeness, that presents a trade-off between the size of the messages from the prover and the size of the messages among neighbors.
  - There exists a dNIZK protocol for any graph property in NP in the random oracle models, which is secure against an arbitrary number of malicious parties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional ML models utilize controlled approximations during high loads, employing faster, but less accurate models in a process called accuracy scaling. However, this method is less effective for generative text-to-image models due to their sensitivity to input prompts and performance degradation caused by large model loading overheads. This work introduces a novel text-to-image inference system that optimally matches prompts across multiple instances of the same model operating at various approximation levels to deliver high-quality images under high loads and fixed budgets.</description>

      <title>Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing using Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has introduced significant challenges in managing the complex, computation-intensive tasks generated by modern vehicles while offloading tasks to external computing infrastructures such as edge computing (EC), nearby vehicular , and UAVs has become influential solution to these challenges. However, traditional computational offloading strategies often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of vehicular environments. In this study, we explored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks to optimize computational offloading through adaptive, real-time decision-making, and we have thoroughly investigated the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approaches on the existing literature. The paper focuses on key aspects such as standardized learning models, optimized reward structures, and collaborative multi-agent systems, aiming to advance the understanding and application of DRL in vehicular networks. Our findings offer insights into enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of ITS, setting the stage for future innovations in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>DROP: Poison Dilution via Knowledge Distillation for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, where malicious clients can inject poisoned updates to influence the global model's behavior. While existing defense mechanisms have made notable progress, they fail to protect against adversaries that aim to induce targeted backdoors under different learning and attack configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce DROP (Distillation-based Reduction Of Poisoning), a novel defense mechanism that combines clustering and activity-tracking techniques with extraction of benign behavior from clients via knowledge distillation to tackle stealthy adversaries that manipulate low data poisoning rates and diverse malicious client ratios within the federation. Through extensive experimentation, our approach demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing defenses across a wide range of learning configurations. Finally, we evaluate existing defenses and our method under the challenging setting of non-IID client data distribution and highlight the challenges of designing a resilient FL defense in this setting.</description>

      <title>Spindle: Efficient Distributed Training of Multi-Task Large Models via Wavefront Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent foundation models are capable of handling multiple tasks and multiple data modalities with the unified base model structure and several specialized model components. However, efficient training of such multi-task (MT) multi-modal (MM) models poses significant system challenges due to the sophisticated model architecture and the heterogeneous workloads of different tasks and modalities.
  In this paper, we propose Spindle, a brand new training system tailored for resource-efficient and high-performance training of MT MM models via wavefront scheduling. The key idea of Spindle is to decompose the model execution into waves and address the joint optimization problem sequentially, including both heterogeneity-aware workload parallelization and dependency-driven execution scheduling. We build our system and evaluate it on various MT MM models. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of Spindle, with speedup ratio up to 71% compared to state-of-the-art training systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal, Non-pipelined Reduce-scatter and Allreduce Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduce-scatter collective operation in which $p$ processors in a network of processors collectively reduce $p$ input vectors into a result vector that is partitioned over the processors is important both in its own right and as building block for other collective operations. We present a surprisingly simple, but non-trivial algorithm for solving this problem optimally in $\lceil\log_2 p\rceil$ communication rounds with each processor sending, receiving and reducing exactly $p-1$ blocks of vector elements. We combine this with a similarly simple, well-known allgather algorithm to get a volume optimal algorithm for the allreduce collective operation where the result vector is replicated on all processors. The communication pattern is a simple, $\lceil\log_2 p\rceil$-regular, circulant graph also used elsewhere. The algorithms assume the binary reduction operator to be commutative and we discuss this assumption. The algorithms can readily be implemented and used for the collective operations MPI_Reduce_scatter_block, MPI_Reduce_scatter and MPI_Allreduce as specified in the MPI standard. We also observe that the reduce-scatter algorithm can be used as a template for round-optimal all-to-all communication and the collective MPI_Alltoall operation.</description>

      <title>FlexSP: Accelerating Large Language Model Training via Flexible Sequence Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the context length (i.e., the maximum supported sequence length) of LLMs is of paramount significance. To facilitate long context training of LLMs, sequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each input sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to process the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume homogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length) and therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input sequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora exhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution, which leads to workload heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we show that employing a single, static strategy results in inefficiency and resource under-utilization, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches to handle the heterogeneous workloads across sequences. To address this, we propose a heterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each training step, our approach captures the variability in sequence lengths and assigns the optimal combination of scattering strategies based on workload characteristics. We model this problem as a linear programming optimization and design an efficient and effective solver to find the optimal solution. Furthermore, we implement our method in a high-performance system that supports adaptive parallelization in distributed LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art training frameworks by up to 1.98x.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Federated Optimization over Semi-Decentralized Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large-scale federated and decentralized learning, communication efficiency is one of the most challenging bottlenecks. While gossip communication -- where agents can exchange information with their connected neighbors -- is more cost-effective than communicating with the remote server, it often requires a greater number of communication rounds, especially for large and sparse networks. To tackle the trade-off, we examine the communication efficiency under a semi-decentralized communication protocol, in which agents can perform both agent-to-agent and agent-to-server communication in a probabilistic manner. We design a tailored communication-efficient algorithm over semi-decentralized networks, referred to as PISCO, which inherits the robustness to data heterogeneity thanks to gradient tracking and allows multiple local updates for saving communication. We establish the convergence rate of PISCO for nonconvex problems and show that PISCO enjoys a linear speedup in terms of the number of agents and local updates. Our numerical results highlight the superior communication efficiency of PISCO and its resilience to data heterogeneity and various network topologies.</description>

      <title>Faster Convergence with Less Communication: Broadcast-Based Subgraph Sampling for Decentralized Learning over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus-based decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) is a widely adopted algorithm for decentralized training of machine learning models across networked agents. A crucial part of D-SGD is the consensus-based model averaging, which heavily relies on information exchange and fusion among the nodes. Specifically, for consensus averaging over wireless networks, communication coordination is necessary to determine when and how a node can access the channel and transmit (or receive) information to (or from) its neighbors. In this work, we propose $\texttt{BASS}$, a broadcast-based subgraph sampling method designed to accelerate the convergence of D-SGD while considering the actual communication cost per iteration. $\texttt{BASS}$ creates a set of mixing matrix candidates that represent sparser subgraphs of the base topology. In each consensus iteration, one mixing matrix is sampled, leading to a specific scheduling decision that activates multiple collision-free subsets of nodes. The sampling occurs in a probabilistic manner, and the elements of the mixing matrices, along with their sampling probabilities, are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate that $\texttt{BASS}$ enables faster convergence with fewer transmission slots compared to existing link-based scheduling methods. In conclusion, the inherent broadcasting nature of wireless channels offers intrinsic advantages in accelerating the convergence of decentralized optimization and learning.</description>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL), which is a decentralized machine learning (ML) approach, often incorporates differential privacy (DP) to provide rigorous data privacy guarantees. Previous works attempted to address high structured data heterogeneity in vanilla FL settings through clustering clients (a.k.a clustered FL), but these methods remain sensitive and prone to errors, further exacerbated by the DP noise. This vulnerability makes the previous methods inappropriate for differentially private FL (DPFL) settings with structured data heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm for differentially private clustered FL, which is robust to the DP noise in the system and identifies the underlying clients' clusters correctly. To this end, we propose to cluster clients based on both their model updates and training loss values. Furthermore, for clustering clients' model updates at the end of the first round, our proposed approach addresses the server's uncertainties by employing large batch sizes as well as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to reduce the impact of DP and stochastic noise and avoid potential clustering errors. This idea is efficient especially in privacy-sensitive scenarios with more DP noise. We provide theoretical analysis to justify our approach and evaluate it across diverse data distributions and privacy budgets. Our experimental results show its effectiveness in addressing large structured data heterogeneity in DPFL.</description>

      <title>Vertical Federated Learning with Missing Features During Training and Inference</title>

Abstract: Vertical federated learning trains models from feature-partitioned datasets across multiple clients, who collaborate without sharing their local data. Standard approaches assume that all feature partitions are available during both training and inference. Yet, in practice, this assumption rarely holds, as for many samples only a subset of the clients observe their partition. However, not utilizing incomplete samples during training harms generalization, and not supporting them during inference limits the utility of the model. Moreover, if any client leaves the federation after training, its partition becomes unavailable, rendering the learned model unusable. Missing feature blocks are therefore a key challenge limiting the applicability of vertical federated learning in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose LASER-VFL, a vertical federated learning method for efficient training and inference of split neural network-based models that is capable of handling arbitrary sets of partitions. Our approach is simple yet effective, relying on the sharing of model parameters and on task-sampling to train a family of predictors. We show that LASER-VFL achieves a $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rate for nonconvex objectives and, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, it achieves linear convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Numerical experiments show improved performance of LASER-VFL over the baselines. Remarkably, this is the case even in the absence of missing features. For example, for CIFAR-100, we see an improvement in accuracy of $18.2\%$ when each of four feature blocks is observed with a probability of 0.5 and of $7.4\%$ when all features are observed.

      <title>Glinthawk: A Two-Tiered Architecture for Offline LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Glinthawk, an architecture for offline Large Language Model (LLM) inference. By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.</description>
