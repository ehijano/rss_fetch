      <title>The Query Complexity of Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic contract design is a new frontier in the intersection of economics and computation, with combinatorial contracts being a core problem in this domain. A central model within combinatorial contracts explores a setting where a principal delegates the execution of a task, which can either succeed or fail, to an agent. The agent can choose any subset among a given set of costly actions, where every subset is associated with a success probability. The principal incentivizes the agent through a contract that specifies the payment upon success of the task.
  A natural setting of interest is one with submodular success probabilities. It is known that finding the optimal contract for the principal is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard, but the hardness result is derived from the hardness of demand queries. A major open problem is whether the hardness arises solely from the hardness of demand queries, or if the complexity lies within the optimal contract problem itself. In other words: does the problem retain its hardness, even when provided access to a demand oracle? We resolve this question in the affirmative, showing that any algorithm that computes the optimal contract for submodular success probabilities requires an exponential number of demand queries, thus settling the query complexity problem.</description>

      <title>DDPS: Dynamic Differential Pricing-based Edge Offloading System with Energy Harvesting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) paves the way to alleviate the burden of energy and computation of mobile users (MUs) by offloading tasks to the network edge. To enhance the MEC server utilization by optimizing its resource allocation, a well-designed pricing strategy is indispensable. In this paper, we consider the edge offloading scenario with energy harvesting devices, and propose a dynamic differential pricing system (DDPS), which determines the price per unit time according to the usage of computing resources to improve the edge server utilization. Firstly, we propose an offloading decision algorithm to decide whether to conduct the offloading operation and how much data to be offloaded if conducted, the algorithm determines offloading operation by balancing the energy harvested with the energy consumed. Secondly, for the offloading case, we formulate the game between the MUs and the server as a Stackelberg game, and propose a differential pricing algorithm to determine the optimal computing resources required by MUs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm also reallocates computing resources for delay-sensitive devices while server resources are surplus after the initial allocation, aiming to make full use of the server computing resources. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDPS scheme.</description>

      <title>Scaling Game-Theoretic Security Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the CheckMate tool for automated verification of game-theoretic security properties, with application to blockchain protocols. CheckMate applies automated reasoning techniques to determine whether a game-theoretic protocol model is game-theoretically secure, that is, Byzantine fault tolerant and incentive compatible. We describe CheckMate's input format and its various components, modes, and output. CheckMate is evaluated on 14 benchmarks, including models of decentralized protocols, board games, and game-theoretic examples.</description>

      <title>Coordination in Noncooperative Multiplayer Matrix Games via Reduced Rank Correlated Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordination in multiplayer games enables players to avoid the lose-lose outcome that often arises at Nash equilibria. However, designing a coordination mechanism typically requires the consideration of the joint actions of all players, which becomes intractable in large-scale games. We develop a novel coordination mechanism, termed reduced rank correlated equilibria, which reduces the number of joint actions to be considered and thereby mitigates computational complexity. The idea is to approximate the set of all joint actions with the actions used in a set of pre-computed Nash equilibria via a convex hull operation. In a game with n players and each player having m actions, the proposed mechanism reduces the number of joint actions considered from O(m^n) to O(mn). We demonstrate the application of the proposed mechanism to an air traffic queue management problem. Compared with the correlated equilibrium-a popular benchmark coordination mechanism-the proposed approach is capable of solving a queue management problem involving four thousand times more joint actions. In the meantime, it yields a solution that shows a 58.5% to 99.5% improvement in the fairness indicator and a 1.8% to 50.4% reduction in average delay cost compared to the Nash solution, which does not involve coordination.</description>

      <title>Subgame Optimal and Prior-Independent Online Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper takes a game theoretic approach to the design and analysis of online algorithms and illustrates the approach on the finite-horizon ski-rental problem. This approach allows beyond worst-case analysis of online algorithms. First, we define "subgame optimality" which is stronger than worst case optimality in that it requires the algorithm to take advantage of an adversary not playing a worst case input. Algorithms only focusing on the worst case can be far from subgame optimal. Second, we consider prior-independent design and analysis of online algorithms, where rather than choosing a worst case input, the adversary chooses a worst case independent and identical distribution over inputs. Prior-independent online algorithms are generally analytically intractable; instead we give a fully polynomial time approximation scheme to compute them. Highlighting the potential improvement from these paradigms for the finite-horizon ski-rental problem, we empirically compare worst-case, subgame optimal, and prior-independent algorithms in the prior-independent framework.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.01680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gale and Shapley introduced a matching problem between two sets of agents where each agent on one side has an exogenous preference ordering over the agents on the other side. They defined a matching as stable if no unmatched pair can both improve their utility by forming a new pair. They proved, algorithmically, the existence of a stable matching. Shapley and Shubik, Demange and Gale, and many others extended the model by allowing monetary transfers. We offer a further extension by assuming that matched couples obtain their payoff endogenously as the outcome of a strategic game they have to play in a usual non-cooperative sense (without commitment) or in a semi-cooperative way (with commitment, as the outcome of a bilateral binding contract in which each player is responsible for her part of the contract). Depending on whether the players can commit or not, we define in each case a solution concept that combines Gale-Shapley pairwise stability with a (generalized) Nash equilibrium stability. In each case we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the set of solutions to be non-empty and provide an algorithm to compute a solution.</description>

      <title>Restricting Entries to All-Pay Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an all-pay contest where players with low abilities are filtered prior to the round of competing for prizes. These are often practiced due to limited resources or to enhance the competitiveness of the contest. We consider a setting where the designer admits a certain number of top players into the contest. The players admitted into the contest update their beliefs about their opponents based on the signal that their abilities are among the top. We find that their posterior beliefs, even with IID priors, are correlated and depend on players' private abilities, representing a unique feature of this game. We explicitly characterize the symmetric and unique Bayesian equilibrium strategy. We find that each admitted player's equilibrium effort is in general not monotone with the number of admitted players. Despite this non-monotonicity, surprisingly, all players exert their highest efforts when all players are admitted. This result holds generally -- it is true under any ranking-based prize structure, ability distribution, and cost function. We also discuss a two-stage extension where players with top first-stage efforts can proceed to the second stage competing for prizes.</description>

      <title>Data Monetization Pathways and Complex Dynamic Game Equilibrium Analysis in the Energy Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the most critical production factor in the era of the digital economy, data will have a significant impact on social production and development. Energy enterprises possess data that is interconnected with multiple industries, characterized by diverse needs, sensitivity, and long-term nature. The path to monetizing energy enterprises' data is challenging yet crucial. This paper explores the game-theoretic aspects of the data monetization process in energy enterprises by considering the relationships between enterprises and trading platforms. We construct a class of game decision models and study their equilibrium strategies. Our analysis shows that enterprises and platforms can adjust respective benefits by regulating the wholesale price of data and the intensity of data value mining to form a benign equilibrium state. Furthermore, by integrating nonlinear dynamical theory, we discuss the dynamic characteristics present in multi-period repeated game processes. We find that decision-makers should keep the adjustment parameters and initial states within reasonable ranges in multi-period dynamic decision-making to avoid market failure. Finally, based on the theoretical and numerical analysis, we provide decision insights and recommendations for enterprise decision-making to facilitate data monetization through strategic interactions with trading platforms.</description>

      <title>Price-Discrimination Game for Distributed Resource Management in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13838v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In vanilla federated learning (FL) such as FedAvg, the parameter server (PS) and multiple distributed clients can form a typical buyer's market, where the number of PS/buyers of FL services is far less than the number of clients/sellers. In order to improve the performance of FL and reduce the cost of motivating clients to participate in FL, this paper proposes to differentiate the pricing for services provided by different clients rather than simply providing the same service pricing for different clients. The price is differentiated based on the performance improvements brought to FL and their heterogeneity in computing and communication capabilities. To this end, a price-discrimination game (PDG) is formulated to comprehensively address the distributed resource management problems in FL, including multi-objective trade-off, client selection, and incentive mechanism. As the PDG is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, a distributed semi-heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity and low communication overhead is designed to solve it. The simulation result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>
