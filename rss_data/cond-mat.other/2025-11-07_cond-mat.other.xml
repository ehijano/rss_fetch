      <title>A quasi-bound band in the continuum in a photonic slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are localized waves in electronic, photonic and acoustic systems, which remain decoupled from surrounding propagating waves and hence maintain their oscillation for extraordinary long time [Nat Rev Mater 1, 16048 (2016)]. In photonic crystals, symmetry-protected quasi-BICs (SP-qBIC) have been realized at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and utilized in photonic crystal and distributed feedback lasers. In the present work, we measure wavevector-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WSe2 weakly coupled to a photonic slab, consisting of a square array of aluminum nanodisks. The results show that the slab supports a continuous band of symmetry-protected quasi-bound states along the Gamma-X direction, extending from the previously reported SP-qBIC at the Gamma point. The spectral width of this quasi-bound band in the continuum remains narrow through at least a half of the Brillouin zone, indicating its long lifetime.</description>

      <title>Revealing the impact of ambient molecular contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of layered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence of surface contamination in STM measurements.</description>

      <title>The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack propagation but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker--Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D Hoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gapless Topological Peierls-like instabilities in more than one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A periodic lattice distortion that reduces the translational symmetry folds electron bands into a reduced Brillouin zone, leading to band mixing and a tendency to gap formation, as in the Peierls transition in one-dimensional systems. However, in higher dimensions, the resulting phase can present topological obstructions preventing a complete gap opening. We discuss two different mechanisms for such obstructions, emergent Weyl nodes and symmetry protected band crossings. Based on density-functional calculations, we show these mechanisms are at play in trigonal PtBi$_2$.</description>

      <title>Terahertz magnon-polaritons control using a tunable liquid crystal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong coupling of light to a collective spin excitation in antiferromagnets gives rise to hybrid modes called magnon-polaritons. They are highly promising for data manipulation and transfer at terahertz rates, much faster than in the case of ferromagnetic magnon-polaritons, which operate at GHz frequencies. Yet, control of terahertz magnon-polaritons by the voltage, i.e. without ohmic dissipation losses, remains challenging. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using an electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-P\'erot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for electrical manipulation of the cavity's photonic environment by control of its dielectric constant. This adjustment, in turn, influences the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons, thereby controlling the vacuum Rabi oscillations of the magnon resonance coupled to a particular cavity mode. Our approach enables reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization that can be triggered without direct electrical contact or alteration of the magnetic medium. These findings pave the way for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and open new avenues for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Inherited Berry curvature of phonons in Dirac materials with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.</description>

      <title>Interplay between inversion and translation symmetries in trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trigonal Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ presents an intriguing superconducting phase, previously reported to be confined to its topological Fermi arcs within a certain temperature range. This observation highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of its normal phase, particularly the roles that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking play in shaping its band structure. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the semimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a noncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure that drives a metal-to-semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and, crucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with translational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant energy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\sim$ 0.6\,eV) in certain short-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary role is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure and of the topological Fermi arcs. This also applies to the formation of the Weyl nodes closest to the Fermi energy, which are found to exist even in the absence of SOC as a result of the orbital physics associated with the reduced translational symmetry.</description>
