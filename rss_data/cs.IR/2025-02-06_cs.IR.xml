      <title>Inducing Diversity in Differentiable Search Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable Search Indexing (DSI) is a recent paradigm for information retrieval which uses a transformer-based neural network architecture as the document index to simplify the retrieval process. A differentiable index has many advantages enabling modifications, updates or extensions to the index. In this work, we explore balancing relevance and novel information content (diversity) for training DSI systems inspired by Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), and show the benefits of our approach over the naive DSI training. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations of relevance and diversity measures obtained using our method on NQ320K and MSMARCO datasets in comparison to naive DSI. With our approach, it is possible to achieve diversity without any significant impact to relevance. Since we induce diversity while training DSI, the trained model has learned to diversify while being relevant. This obviates the need for a post-processing step to induce diversity in the recall set as typically performed using MMR. Our approach will be useful for Information Retrieval problems where both relevance and diversity are important such as in sub-topic retrieval. Our work can also be easily be extended to the incremental DSI settings which would enable fast updates to the index while retrieving a diverse recall set.</description>

      <title>TD3: Tucker Decomposition Based Dataset Distillation Method for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of data-centric AI, the focus of recommender systems has shifted from model-centric innovations to data-centric approaches. The success of modern AI models is built on large-scale datasets, but this also results in significant training costs. Dataset distillation has emerged as a key solution, condensing large datasets to accelerate model training while preserving model performance. However, condensing discrete and sequentially correlated user-item interactions, particularly with extensive item sets, presents considerable challenges. This paper introduces \textbf{TD3}, a novel \textbf{T}ucker \textbf{D}ecomposition based \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation method within a meta-learning framework, designed for sequential recommendation. TD3 distills a fully expressive \emph{synthetic sequence summary} from original data. To efficiently reduce computational complexity and extract refined latent patterns, Tucker decomposition decouples the summary into four factors: \emph{synthetic user latent factor}, \emph{temporal dynamics latent factor}, \emph{shared item latent factor}, and a \emph{relation core} that models their interconnections. Additionally, a surrogate objective in bi-level optimization is proposed to align feature spaces extracted from models trained on both original data and synthetic sequence summary beyond the na\"ive performance matching approach. In the \emph{inner-loop}, an augmentation technique allows the learner to closely fit the synthetic summary, ensuring an accurate update of it in the \emph{outer-loop}. To accelerate the optimization process and address long dependencies, RaT-BPTT is employed for bi-level optimization. Experiments and analyses on multiple public datasets have confirmed the superiority and cross-architecture generalizability of the proposed designs.

      <title>Control Search Rankings, Control the World: What is a Good Search Engine?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the ethical question, 'What is a good search engine?' Since search engines are gatekeepers of global online information, it is vital they do their job ethically well. While the Internet is now several decades old, the topic remains under-explored from interdisciplinary perspectives. This paper presents a novel role-based approach involving four ethical models of types of search engine behavior: Customer Servant, Librarian, Journalist, and Teacher. It explores these ethical models with reference to the research field of information retrieval, and by means of a case study involving the COVID-19 global pandemic. It also reflects on the four ethical models in terms of the history of search engine development, from earlier crude efforts in the 1990s, to the very recent prospect of Large Language Model-based conversational information seeking systems taking on the roles of established web search engines like Google. Finally, the paper outlines considerations that inform present and future regulation and accountability for search engines as they continue to evolve. The paper should interest information retrieval researchers and others interested in the ethics of search engines.</description>

      <title>FACTER: Fairness-Aware Conformal Thresholding and Prompt Engineering for Enabling Fair LLM-Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose FACTER, a fairness-aware framework for LLM-based recommendation systems that integrates conformal prediction with dynamic prompt engineering. By introducing an adaptive semantic variance threshold and a violation-triggered mechanism, FACTER automatically tightens fairness constraints whenever biased patterns emerge. We further develop an adversarial prompt generator that leverages historical violations to reduce repeated demographic biases without retraining the LLM. Empirical results on MovieLens and Amazon show that FACTER substantially reduces fairness violations (up to 95.5%) while maintaining strong recommendation accuracy, revealing semantic variance as a potent proxy of bias.</description>

      <title>Assessing Research Impact in Indian Conference Proceedings: Insights from Collaboration and Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conferences serve as a crucial avenue for scientific communication. However, the increase in conferences and the subsequent publication of proceedings have prompted inquiries regarding the research quality being showcased at such events. This investigation delves into the conference publications indexed by Springer's Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems Series. Among the 570 international conferences held worldwide in this series, 177 were exclusively hosted in India. These 177 conferences collectively published 11,066 papers as conference proceedings. All these publications, along with conference details, were sourced from the Scopus database. The study aims to evaluate the research impact of these conference proceedings and identify the primary contributors. The results reveal a downward trend in the average number of citations per year. The collective average citation for all publications is 1.01. Papers co-authored by Indian and international authors (5.6%) exhibit a higher average impact of 1.44, in contrast to those authored solely by Indian authors (84.9%), which have an average impact of 0.97. Notably, Indian-collaborated papers, among the largest contributors, predominantly originate from private colleges and universities. Only 19% of papers exhibit collaboration with institutes of different prestige, yet their impact is considerably higher as compared to collaboration with institutes of similar prestige. This study highlights the importance of improving research quality in academic forums.</description>

      <title>FuXi-$\alpha$: Scaling Recommendation Model with Feature Interaction Enhanced Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by scaling laws and large language models, research on large-scale recommendation models has gained significant attention. Recent advancements have shown that expanding sequential recommendation models to large-scale recommendation models can be an effective strategy. Current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models primarily use self-attention mechanisms for explicit feature interactions among items, while implicit interactions are managed through Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). However, these models often inadequately integrate temporal and positional information, either by adding them to attention weights or by blending them with latent representations, which limits their expressive power. A recent model, HSTU, further reduces the focus on implicit feature interactions, constraining its performance. We propose a new model called FuXi-$\alpha$ to address these issues. This model introduces an Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention mechanism that distinctly models temporal, positional, and semantic features, along with a Multi-stage FFN to enhance implicit feature interactions. Our offline experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models, with its performance continuously improving as the model size increases. Additionally, we conducted an online A/B test within the Huawei Music app, which showed a $4.76\%$ increase in the average number of songs played per user and a $5.10\%$ increase in the average listening duration per user. Our code has been released at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/FuXi-alpha.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Universal Recommendation Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world recommender systems, different tasks are typically addressed using supervised learning on task-specific datasets with carefully designed model architectures. We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can function as universal recommendation learners, capable of handling multiple tasks within a unified input-output framework, eliminating the need for specialized model designs. To improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we introduce a multimodal fusion module for item representation and a sequence-in-set-out approach for efficient candidate generation. When applied to industrial-scale data, our LLM achieves competitive results with expert models elaborately designed for different recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that recommendation outcomes are highly sensitive to text input, highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in optimizing industrial-scale recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Data Dams: A Novel Framework for Regulating and Managing Data Flow in Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of big data, managing dynamic data flows efficiently is crucial as traditional storage models struggle with real-time regulation and risk overflow. This paper introduces Data Dams, a novel framework designed to optimize data inflow, storage, and outflow by dynamically adjusting flow rates to prevent congestion while maximizing resource utilization. Inspired by physical dam mechanisms, the framework employs intelligent sluice controls and predictive analytics to regulate data flow based on system conditions such as bandwidth availability, processing capacity, and security constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the Data Dam significantly reduces average storage levels (371.68 vs. 426.27 units) and increases total outflow (7999.99 vs. 7748.76 units) compared to static baseline models. By ensuring stable and adaptive outflow rates under fluctuating data loads, this approach enhances system efficiency, mitigates overflow risks, and outperforms existing static flow control strategies. The proposed framework presents a scalable solution for dynamic data management in large-scale distributed systems, paving the way for more resilient and efficient real-time processing architectures.</description>

      <title>Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines. The implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IRLLRec.</description>

      <title>Interactive Visualization Recommendation with Hier-SUCB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualization recommendation aims to enable rapid visual analysis of massive datasets. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to quickly gather and comprehend user preferences to cover users from diverse backgrounds, including varying skill levels and analytical tasks. Previous approaches to personalized visualization recommendations are non-interactive and rely on initial user data for new users. As a result, these models cannot effectively explore options or adapt to real-time feedback. To address this limitation, we propose an interactive personalized visualization recommendation (PVisRec) system that learns on user feedback from previous interactions. For more interactive and accurate recommendations, we propose Hier-SUCB, a contextual combinatorial semi-bandit in the PVisRec setting. Theoretically, we show an improved overall regret bound with the same rank of time but an improved rank of action space. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of Hier-SUCB through extensive experiments where it is comparable to offline methods and outperforms other bandit algorithms in the setting of visualization recommendation.</description>

      <title>DenseReviewer: A Screening Prioritisation Tool for Systematic Review based on Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screening is a time-consuming and labour-intensive yet required task for medical systematic reviews, as tens of thousands of studies often need to be screened. Prioritising relevant studies to be screened allows downstream systematic review creation tasks to start earlier and save time. In previous work, we developed a dense retrieval method to prioritise relevant studies with reviewer feedback during the title and abstract screening stage. Our method outperforms previous active learning methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In this demo, we extend this prior work by creating (1) a web-based screening tool that enables end-users to screen studies exploiting state-of-the-art methods and (2) a Python library that integrates models and feedback mechanisms and allows researchers to develop and demonstrate new active learning methods. We describe the tool's design and showcase how it can aid screening. The tool is available at https://densereviewer.ielab.io. The source code is also open sourced at https://github.com/ielab/densereviewer.</description>

      <title>Investigating Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives: Examining the case of corporate Covid-19 response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In todays age of freely available information, policy makers have to take into account a huge amount of information while making decisions affecting relevant stakeholders. While increase in the amount of information sources and documents increases credibility of decisions based on the corpus of available text, it is challenging for policymakers to make sense of this information. This paper demonstrates how policy makers can implement some of the most popular topic recognition methods, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Deep Distributed Representation method, text summarization approaches, Word Based Sentence Ranking method and TextRank for sentence extraction method, to sum up the content of large volume of documents to understand the gist of the overload of information. We have applied popular NLP methods to corporate press releases during the early period and advanced period of Covid-19 pandemic which has resulted in a global unprecedented health and socio-economic crisis, when policymaking and regulations have become especially important to standardize corporate practices for employee and social welfare in the face of similar future unseen crises. The steps undertaken in this study can be replicated to yield insights from relevant documents in any other social decision-making context.</description>

      <title>PalimpChat: Declarative and Interactive AI analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the advances in generative architectures and large language models, data scientists can now code pipelines of machine-learning operations to process large collections of unstructured data. Recent progress has seen the rise of declarative AI frameworks (e.g., Palimpzest, Lotus, and DocETL) to build optimized and increasingly complex pipelines, but these systems often remain accessible only to expert programmers. In this demonstration, we present PalimpChat, a chat-based interface to Palimpzest that bridges this gap by letting users create and run sophisticated AI pipelines through natural language alone. By integrating Archytas, a ReAct-based reasoning agent, and Palimpzest's suite of relational and LLM-based operators, PalimpChat provides a practical illustration of how a chat interface can make declarative AI frameworks truly accessible to non-experts.
  Our demo system is publicly available online. At SIGMOD'25, participants can explore three real-world scenarios--scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search--or apply PalimpChat to their own datasets. In this paper, we focus on how PalimpChat, supported by the Palimpzest optimizer, simplifies complex AI workflows such as extracting and analyzing biomedical data.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid increase in paper submissions to academic conferences, the need for automated and accurate paper-reviewer matching is more critical than ever. Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission. Experiments on four datasets (one of which is newly contributed by us) spanning various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, and data mining consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Chain-of-Factors model in comparison with state-of-the-art paper-reviewer matching methods and scientific pre-trained language models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09369v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has been effectively utilized to enhance the training of sequential recommendation models by leveraging informative self-supervised signals. Most existing approaches generate augmented views of the same user sequence through random augmentation and subsequently maximize their agreement in the representation space. However, these methods often neglect the rationality of the augmented samples. Due to significant uncertainty, random augmentation can disrupt the semantic information and interest evolution patterns inherent in the original user sequences. Moreover, pulling semantically inconsistent sequences closer in the representation space can render the user sequence embeddings insensitive to variations in user preferences, which contradicts the primary objective of sequential recommendation. To address these limitations, we propose the Context-aware Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation, named CaDiRec. The core idea is to leverage context information to generate more reasonable augmented views. Specifically, CaDiRec employs a context-aware diffusion model to generate alternative items for the given positions within a sequence. These generated items are aligned with their respective context information and can effectively replace the corresponding original items, thereby generating a positive view of the original sequence. By considering two different augmentations of the same user sequence, we can construct a pair of positive samples for contrastive learning. To ensure representation cohesion, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner, with shared item embeddings between the diffusion model and the recommendation model. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, but also figures, page layouts, tables, or even fonts. Since modern retrieval systems mainly rely on the textual information they extract from document pages to index documents -often through lengthy and brittle processes-, they struggle to exploit key visual cues efficiently. This limits their capabilities in many practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieval tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and practical settings. The inherent complexity and performance shortcomings of modern systems motivate a new concept; doing document retrieval by directly embedding the images of the document pages. We release ColPali, a Vision Language Model trained to produce high-quality multi-vector embeddings from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically simpler, faster and end-to-end trainable. We release models, data, code and benchmarks under open licenses at https://huggingface.co/vidore.</description>

      <title>RuleRAG: Rule-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Language Models for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential in knowledge intensive question answering (QA). However, existing approaches only consider the query itself, neither specifying the retrieval preferences for the retrievers nor informing the generators of how to refer to the retrieved documents for the answers, which poses a significant challenge to the QA performance. To address these issues, we propose Rule-guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LMs, which explicitly introduces rules for in-context learning (RuleRAG-ICL) to guide retrievers to recall related documents in the directions of rules and uniformly guide generators to reason attributed by the same rules. Moreover, most existing RAG datasets were constructed without considering rules and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are recognized as providing high-quality rules. Therefore, we construct five rule-aware RAG benchmarks for QA, RuleQA, based on KGs to stress the significance of retrieval and reasoning with rules. Experiments on RuleQA demonstrate RuleRAG-ICL improves the retrieval quality of +89.2% in Recall@10 and answer accuracy of +103.1% in Exact Match, and RuleRAG-FT yields more enhancement. In addition, experiments on four existing RAG datasets show RuleRAG is also effective by offering rules in RuleQA to them, further proving the generalization of rule guidance in RuleRAG.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Recommendation Loss Functions under Negative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loss functions like Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE), Binary Cross Entropy (BCE), and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) are commonly used in training Recommender Systems (RSs) to differentiate positive items - those interacted with by users - and negative items. While prior works empirically showed that CCE outperforms BCE and BPR when using the full set of negative items, we provide a theoretical explanation for this by proving that CCE offers the tightest lower bound on ranking metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), followed by BPR and BCE. However, using the full set of negative items is computationally infeasible for large-scale RSs, prompting the use of negative sampling techniques. Under negative sampling, we reveal that BPR and CCE are equivalent when a single negative sample is drawn, and all three losses converge to the same global minimum. We further demonstrate that the sampled losses remain lower bounds for NDCG (MRR), albeit in a probabilistic sense. Our worst-case analysis shows that BCE offers the strongest bound on NDCG (MRR). Experiments on five datasets and four models empirically support these theoretical findings. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/recsys_losses .</description>

      <title>Invariant debiasing learning for recommendation via biased imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous debiasing studies utilize unbiased data to make supervision of model training. They suffer from the high trial risks and experimental costs to obtain unbiased data. Recent research attempts to use invariant learning to detach the invariant preference of users for unbiased recommendations in an unsupervised way. However, it faces the drawbacks of low model accuracy and unstable prediction performance due to the losing cooperation with variant preference. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that invariant learning causes information loss by directly discarding the variant information, which reduces the generalization ability and results in the degradation of model performance in unbiased recommendations. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel lightweight knowledge distillation framework (KDDebias) to automatically learn the unbiased preference of users from both invariant and variant information. Specifically, the variant information is imputed to the invariant user preference in the distance-aware knowledge distillation process. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, i.e., Yahoo!R3, Coat, and MIND, show that with the biased imputation from the variant preference of users, our proposed method achieves significant improvements with less than 50% learning parameters compared to the SOTA unsupervised debiasing model in recommender systems. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/KD-Debias.</description>

      <title>Rankify: A Comprehensive Python Toolkit for Retrieval, Re-Ranking, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval, re-ranking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are critical components of modern natural language processing (NLP) applications in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge-based text generation. However, existing solutions are often fragmented, lacking a unified framework that easily integrates these essential processes. The absence of a standardized implementation, coupled with the complexity of retrieval and re-ranking workflows, makes it challenging for researchers to compare and evaluate different approaches in a consistent environment. While existing toolkits such as Rerankers and RankLLM provide general-purpose reranking pipelines, they often lack the flexibility required for fine-grained experimentation and benchmarking. In response to these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Rankify}, a powerful and modular open-source toolkit designed to unify retrieval, re-ranking, and RAG within a cohesive framework. Rankify supports a wide range of retrieval techniques, including dense and sparse retrievers, while incorporating state-of-the-art re-ranking models to enhance retrieval quality. Additionally, Rankify includes a collection of pre-retrieved datasets to facilitate benchmarking, available at Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/datasets/abdoelsayed/reranking-datasets). To encourage adoption and ease of integration, we provide comprehensive documentation (http://rankify.readthedocs.io/), an open-source implementation on GitHub(https://github.com/DataScienceUIBK/rankify), and a PyPI package for effortless installation(https://pypi.org/project/rankify/). By providing a unified and lightweight framework, Rankify allows researchers and practitioners to advance retrieval and re-ranking methodologies while ensuring consistency, scalability, and ease of use.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The takeaway recommendation system aims to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and boosting merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequences. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) capturing dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) efficiently integrating spatial-temporal knowledge from both graphs and sequence data with low computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation model for takeaway recommendation (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is trained to extract high-order spatial-temporal dependencies and collaborative associations from the STKG. During the second spatial-temporal knowledge distillation (STKD) stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer) is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequential perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to transfer graph-based spatial-temporal knowledge to the ST-Transformer, facilitating the adaptive fusion of rich knowledge derived from both the STKG and sequence data while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
