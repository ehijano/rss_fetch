      <title>Early Universe production of $W$ bosons in neutrino decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study, via perturbative methods, the rates of production of $W$ bosons emitted in neutrino decays during the early stages of the Universe. We compute the transition amplitude corresponding to the first order of de Sitter electro-weak perturbation theory and study its various limiting cases. The transition rates are derived using minimal subtraction and dimensional regularization. In the end we obtain the density number of bosons (as a function of temperature), and give an estimation of this number for different temperatures and fixed values of the particle momenta.</description>

      <title>Singlet-doublet dark matter revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet model is an economical model of weakly interacting dark matter. We revisit it in light of improved dark matter direct detection limits. We characterize the now well-defined regions of remaining parameter space with suppressed direct detection cross sections and discuss features of the spectrum accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. We discuss when and how parameters in these special regions might be realized as the result of renormalization group evolution when starting with generic ultraviolet initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Probing Lepton Flavor Violation at Linear Electron-Positron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of $\tau\mu$ pairs in electron-positron collisions offers a powerful probe of lepton flavor violation. In this work, we calculate the $e^+ e^- \to \tau \mu$ cross section within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, allowing for arbitrary $e^+e^-$ beam polarizations. We then estimate the sensitivities of proposed future linear colliders, ILC and CLIC, to effective lepton flavor-violating interactions. The high center-of-mass energies achievable at these machines provide particularly strong sensitivity to four-fermion operators. Furthermore, the polarization of the $e^+e^-$ beams enables novel tests of the chirality structure of these interactions. We find that our projected sensitivities not only complement but in certain scenarios surpass those achievable with low-energy tau decay measurements at Belle~II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new tune (set of model parameters) is found for the six most important parameters of the Pythia8 final state parton shower and hadronization model using Bayesian optimization. The tune fits the LEPI data from ALEPH better than the default tune in Pythia8. To the best of our knowledge, we present the most comprehensive application of Bayesian optimization to the tuning of a parton shower and hadronization model using the LEPI data.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography beyond the leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tomography, as a tool to probe foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, relies on extracting spin information from angular distributions. This is inherently a leading-order technique, ill-defined when higher-order corrections are significant. For those cases, we propose to treat higher-order corrections as a background, to be modeled and subtracted from data in the same way as other backgrounds are. We illustrate this procedure for Higgs decays $H \to ZZ \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, which is of high interest for upcoming qutrit entanglement tests at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of elastic pp cross section from the ISR to the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the property that the ratio of bump to dip {\em positions} of the elastic differential $pp$ cross section is constant over the energy range from the ISR to the LHC. We review the old idea of geometric scaling at the ISR and argue that it also holds at the LHC. We discuss its consequences for the $\rho$ parameter and for the ratio of bump to dip cross section {\em values}.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Advantage of Quantum Coherence in Top Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in investigating top-quark systems using tools from quantum information theory. A key peculiarity of the top quark is that it decays before hadronization or spin decorrelation occurs, thereby preserving its spin information. This unique property enables direct access to spin correlations, making the top quark an ideal candidate for probing fundamental quantum correlations in high-energy physics processes. A wide range of concepts from quantum information theory, such as entanglement, Bell nonlocality, quantum steering, quantum discord, and fidelity, have been investigated in this context. Several of these measures have been employed as diagnostic tools to test the Standard Model and to search for possible signatures of physics beyond. However, the $\textit{nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence}$ (NAQC) has remained largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we present a detailed investigation of the NAQC in top quark pair production. We employ two complementary NAQC measures based on the $l_{1}$-norm and the relative entropy of coherence. We also study the effect of angular averaging on these measures. Our findings reveal rich coherence structures and highlight NAQC as potentially a novel and complementary quantum signature in high-energy physics systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement is Quantum: ZZ Production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization and spin correlations in diboson systems serve as powerful tools for precision tests and searches for new physics. Recently, interpreting these observables through the lens of quantum information, for instance by examining whether the diboson systems exhibit entanglement, has introduced a compelling new dimension to these studies. We analyze the angular coefficients in the processes $pp\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ and $h\to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$, incorporating higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections. Guided by the fundamental properties of the spin density matrix, we assess the stability of the two-qutrit interpretation under radiative effects. For the $pp \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process, NLO QCD corrections preserve the two-qutrit structure but weaken entanglement indicators, an effect that can be partially mitigated by jet binning. In contrast, electroweak corrections introduce non-factorizable contributions that modify the quantum properties of the system. While these effects can be largely depleted by selecting events with a double-resonant $ZZ$ structure, such a kinematic handle is not available for Higgs decays. In the $h \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ channel, singly-resonant NLO electroweak corrections substantially distort the angular coefficients, challenging the description of these events as a two-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds and Global Fit of Flavor-Violating Charged Lepton Yukawa Couplings post LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs couplings to charged leptons form an important measurement to understand not only the Standard Model (SM), but also physics Beyond Standard Models (BSM). In this work, we update the bounds on the Flavor-Violating (FV) Higgs couplings to charged leptons. We find that the bounds on the size of the couplings could range between $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$. In fact, the direct constraints from LHC are much stronger than those inferred indirectly from rare decays in the $\tau$-$\mu$ and $\tau$-$e$ sector. We also match these bounds to the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and find lower limits on the scale of New Physics (NP). We find that the scale of NP ranges between $\sim \mathcal{O}(10) - \mathcal{O}(100)$ TeV. We also present future projections for some upcoming experiments. We find that the current bounds on the couplings to $\mu$-$e$ are stronger than all future projections.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Constraints on ALP Couplings from future $e^+e^-$ Colliders, Muon $g-2$, Thermal Dark Matter and Higgs Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present projected 95% C.L. limits on Axion-Like Particle (ALP) couplings from ALP production at a future $e^+e^-$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s} = 250~\text{GeV}$ with integrated luminosity $L = 0.5~\text{ab}^{-1}$. We constrain the effective couplings $g_{\gamma\gamma}$, $g_{Z\gamma}$, $g_{ZZ}$, and $g_{WW}$ over the ALP mass range $20~\text{GeV} \leq m_a \leq 100~\text{GeV}$, finding projected bounds at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})~\text{TeV}^{-1}$ for $g_{\gamma\gamma}/f_a$. We then focus on the $4\sigma$-favored region of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\Delta a_\mu$, deriving corresponding bounds on $g_{\gamma\gamma}$ and the ALP-muon coupling $C_{\mu\mu}$, and applying them to a fermionic dark matter scenario in which the relic density depends on both $m_\chi$ and $m_a$. The same parameter space is further constrained by Higgs signal strength measurements through $h \to \gamma\gamma$ and $h \to Z\gamma$. A comparative analysis with existing experimental and theoretical bounds highlights the complementarity of $\Delta a_\mu$, dark matter, and Higgs signal strengths observables in constraining ALP couplings.</description>

      <title>Probing new physics in the top sector using quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that quantitative concepts from quantum information theory can play a role in analysing collider physics, including elucidating new physics. In this paper, we study various QI measures including magic, trace distance and fidelity distance, in generic new physics scenarios modelled by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We argue that such measures can indeed show up differences with respect to the pure Standard Model, and we compare our results with similar findings for the concurrence discussed previously in the literature. We examine the relative sensitivity of different measures to new physics in two-dimensional bins of the top pair invariant mass and scattering angle, finding that the concurrence, magic and trace distance each emerge as the best measure in at least some regions of the phase space. This highlights the importance of exploring multiple quantum information measures in the hunt for beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <title>The Two-Higgs Doublet Model beyond tree-level: A gauge-invariant formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the gauge-invariant formalism in the two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM) offers profound insights into the model's fundamental structure. A specific set of gauge-invariant bilinear combinations, constructed from the Higgs doublets, establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the components of the doublet fields and real-valued bilinears. This formalism provides a compact and consistent framework to study various aspects of the THDM, including stability, electroweak symmetry breaking, basis transformations, and general symmetries of the Higgs potential.
  Recently, the bilinear formalism has been extended beyond the Higgs potential to encompass the full THDM, including the gauge and Yukawa sectors, all in gauge-invariant terms. In this work, we advance the formalism further by incorporating quantum corrections. Specifically, we show how bilinears, combined with the $\hbar$-expansion, can be used to compute one-loop corrections. We provide concise, gauge-invariant expressions for these corrections, which are directly applicable to the THDM.</description>

      <title>Probing the 3+1 neutrino model in the SHiP experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, as an extension of our previous work, we estimate the sensitivity of the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment to the 3+1 model using the charged-current deep inelastic scattering event spectrum. We employ the Feldman-Cousins method with a parametric bootstrap to account for nuisance parameters and systematic uncertainties. In the previous study, we proposed a dual baseline approach by suggesting Far SND (FSND) at 120 m with Near SND (NSND) at 27 m. We employ the same approach in this study. The NSND-only configuration can probe mixing parameters of $|U_{\alpha4}|^2 \gtrsim 0.1$ near $\Delta m_{41}^2 \sim 10^3\,\mathrm{eV}^2$, with a reduction of normalized systematic uncertainties from 20\% to 10\% improving sensitivity by roughly a factor of two. Moreover, the inclusion of FSND significantly enhances the sensitivity by a factor of 2 to 10 depending on the flavor and the systematic uncertainty. In two-flavor mixing scenarios, a cancellation between neutrino appearance and disappearance generates kinks in the sensitivity curves, that are vanished in the dual-baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spectroscopic features of double-strangeness tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the $T_{cc}$ double-charm tetaquark by the LHCb collaboration, the field of the theoretical research on heavy quarks has advanced rapidly, with increasing interest in exploring the light quark sector. In this study, the quark model is employed to systematically analyze the double-strange tetraquark system. Both the meson-meson configuration and diquark-antidiquark configuration are considered. The interactions between hadron pairs under various quantum numbers, as well as the possibilities of bound states and resonances, are evaluated. The results indicate the presence of two bound states, $ \bar{K}^{\ast }\bar{K}$ and $\bar{K}^{\ast }\bar{K}^{\ast}$, with quantum number $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ in single-channel estimations. Additionally, by considering the channel coupling between the two configurations, a bound state with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ and a mass of approximately $1310$ MeV is obtained. Moreover, through the application of Resonance Ground Method, a resonance state is identified in the $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ $\ssqq$ system, with an estimated mass of around 1783 MeV and a decay width of approximately 17 MeV.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization approach to deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the deuteron's wave functions as eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light-front quantization, without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates include six-quark and six-quark--one-gluon components. The deuteron wave function consists of both a singlet-singlet color state and additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wave function. This highlights the significant role of hidden color components in the QCD description of nuclear structure. Using these wave functions, we investigate the deuteron's electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Modular Symmetry with Weighton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically develop the weighton mechanism for natural quark and charged lepton mass hierarchies in the framework of modular symmetry with a single modulus field $\tau$. The weighton $\phi$ is defined as a complete singlet with unit modular weight, leading to fermion mass suppression by powers of $\tilde{\phi}$, which is the vacuum expectation value of the field scaled by a flavour cut-off. Further mass and mixing angle suppression comes from powers of the small parameter, $q\equiv e^{i2\pi \tau}$. Assuming some fields transform as triplets under the finite modular symmetry, with general assignments for the other fields, we perform a complete analysis for the levels $N=3, 4, 5$, expressing fermion masses and mixings in terms of powers of the small parameters $\tilde{\phi}$ and $q$. We present two examples in detail, based on the modular group $T'$, close to the CP boundary of $\tau$, which can address both fermion mass and mixing hierarchies using a weighton field.</description>

      <title>Experimental Particle Physics Priorities 2025: A String Phenomenology Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the SNOWMASS 2021 process in the US and the on--going European Strategy Report 2025, the field of elementary particle physics is undergoing detailed community evaluation, and the experimental particle physics program, which requires substantial public investment, is under scrutiny. We offer an assessment of the current experimental particle physics priorities from a string phenomenology point of view. String theory provides a perturbatively consistent framework for quantum gravity. String phenomenology aims to connect between string theory and observational data. String theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity that contains the other fundamental constituents of matter and interactions. As all forms of energy couple to gravity, string theory provides a framework that reproduces the structures of the Standard Model of particle physics and gives rise to detailed physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model, {\it e.g.} dark matter candidates, axions, additional gauge symmetries, etc. Given this breadth, we propose that from a string phenomenology perspective, the experimental particle physics priority is the nature of the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. An ideal facility in the near future to study this sector is a hadron collider at 50--60 TeV that utilises contemporary magnet technology and can be built in 10--15 years from decision.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermionic sub-GeV Dark Matter from evaporating Primordial Black Holes at DarkSide-50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment's ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg\: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential intra-jet radiation patterns in jet production at full colour. We present a systematic study of several QCD $2\to 2$ processes and also multi-jet production from a colourless initial state. We examine how subleading colour corrections are distributed differentially in phase space and find that mere normalization effects due to subleading colour can be due to subtle cancellations across phase space. In general, we find that subleading colour does affect the shapes of distributions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to New Physics Phenomena in Anomaly Detection: A Study of Untunable Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at collider experiments requires model-independent strategies to avoid missing possible discoveries of unexpected signals. Anomaly detection (AD) techniques offer a promising approach by identifying deviations from the Standard Model (SM) and have been extensively studied. The sensitivity of these methods to untunable hyperparameters has not been systematically compared, however. This study addresses it by investigating four semi-supervised AD methods -- Auto-Encoders, Deep Support Vector Data Description, Histogram-based Outlier Score, and Isolation Forest -- trained on simulated SM background events. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of these methods to BSM benchmark signals as a function of these untunable hyperparameters. Such a study is complemented by a proposal of a non-parametric permutation test using signal-agnostic statistics, which can provide a robust statistical assessment.</description>

      <title>Probing the $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c}^{*}\tau \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays with leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the standard model to include a single scalar or vector leptoquark has been shown to account for the observed deviations in the lepton flavor universality ratios in the $b \to c \ell \nu_{\ell}$ and $b \to s \ell \ell$ transitions. Exploring new physics in the $b \to c \tau \nu_{\tau}$ decays, in this work we analyze the baryonic decay channels $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_{c}^{*}(2595,2625) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ beyond the standard model. Specifically, we investigate the role of leptoquarks in these decays, focusing on the $U_1$ vector leptoquark and the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark. Employing recent lattice QCD results for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_{c}^{*}$ form factors, the helicity amplitudes for all possible four-fermion interactions are worked out explicitly and presented here. Utilizing the current $b \to c \ell \nu_{\ell}$ experimental data, we impose constraints on the leptoquark couplings and test new physics sensitivity of various observables for the decay processes under consideration. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of testing the lepton flavor universality ratio $R_{\Lambda_{c}^{*}}$ as it is observed to be particularly sensitive to these leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for softened hadron production at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a data-driven study of the production of softened hadrons and their contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum. To this end, we assume that the production of charged particles at soft and hard scales fundamentally results from the fragmentation of color strings. We analyze the $p_\text{T}$-spectrum data from pp to AA collisions at LHC energies reported by the ALICE Collaboration, finding that, in all cases, the data can be collapsed into a $p_\text{T}$-exponential trend in the range 1 GeV$&lt;p_\text{T}&lt;$6 GeV. With this insight, the description of the $p_\text{T}$-spectrum should contain information on the charged particle production coming from two different sources: fragmentation of color strings and collective phenomena that redistribute the transverse momentum and enhance the production of particles at intermediate $p_\text{T}$. We also found different relations between the effective temperature, multiplicity, and average $p_\text{T}$ for pp and AA collisions, indicating inherent dissimilarities between small and large colliding systems. In contrast, the contribution of the softened hadrons to the $p_\text{T}$-spectrum and average $p_\text{T}$ collapse onto scaling laws. Our results show that the physical mechanisms producing softened hadrons have similar origins for all colliding systems, revealing a stronger dependence on freeze-out parameters rather than the system size.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space.</description>

      <title>Flavor Equilibration of Supernova Neutrinos: Exploring the Dynamics of Slow Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos experience collective flavor conversion in extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). One manifestation of collective conversion is slow flavor conversion (SFC), which has recently attracted renewed interest owing to its ubiquity across different regions of the supernova environment. In this study, we systematically examine the evolution of kinematic decoherence in a dense neutrino gas undergoing SFC, considering lepton number asymmetries as large as $30\%$. Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies. Notably, the quasi-steady state of the neutrino number densities can be quantitatively described by the neutrino-antineutrino number density ratio $n_{\bar{\nu}_e}/n_{\nu_e}$ alone. Such a simple estimation opens new opportunities for incorporating SFC into CCSN simulations, particularly in regions where SFC develops on scales much shorter than those of collisions.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Dark Energy from non-perturbative Higgs-Yang-Mills mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that dark energy arises from a strongly-coupled Higgs-Yang-Mills set of interacting fields in the non-perturbative regime. We choose the simplest $SU(2)$ representation, which is compatible with the Cosmological Principle. One of the components of the Higgs doublet act as an effective quintessence scalar field interacting with both gravity and the gauge field. We devise a multiple time scale approach to solve the equations of motion through a hierarchy of the couplings, utilizing exact solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We observe that the time scale of variation of the Hubble constant is the slowest one, while, for the scalar field, assuming that its self-coupling is smaller than the coupling of the gauge field, represents an intermediate time scale. From the consistency of the Friedmann equations, we show how the effect of the scalar field is to give origin to dark energy with a proper equation of state corrected by a very small time-dependent term. Finally, agreement with cosmological data for the dark energy density is shown without relying on the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the model.</description>

      <title>Probing Nuclear Geometry through Multi-Particle Azimuthal Correlations and Rapidity-Even Dipolar Flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric and asymmetric cumulants as well as rapidity-even dipolar flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV to explore $\alpha$-clustering phenomena in light nuclei within the viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework. Signatures of $\alpha$-clustering manifest in the anisotropic flow coefficients and their correlations -- particularly in observables involving elliptic-triangular flow correlations. We show that final-state symmetric and asymmetric cumulants -- especially $\mathrm{NSC}(2,3)$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{2,1}(2,3)$ -- are sensitive to the initial nuclear geometry. Additionally, we observe a significant difference in rapidity-even dipolar flow, $v_1^{\text{even}}$, between $\alpha$-clustered and Woods--Saxon configurations in high-multiplicity events. These findings underscore the pivotal role of nuclear structure in heavy-ion collision dynamics and provide observables for distinguishing nuclear geometries, particularly in ultra-central collisions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lattice QCD Computation of Radiative-Leptonic-Decay Form Factors at Multiple Positive and Negative Photon Virtualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work Phys. Rev. D 107, 074507 (2023), we showed that form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons can be determined efficiently and with high precision from lattice QCD using the ``3d method,'' in which three-point functions are computed for all values of the current-insertion time and the time integral is performed at the data-analysis stage. Here, we demonstrate another benefit of the 3d method: the form factors can be extracted for any number of nonzero photon virtualites from the same three-point functions at no extra cost. We present results for the $D_s\to\ell\nu\gamma^*$ vector form factor as a function of photon energy and photon virtuality, for both positive and negative virtuality. In our analysis, we separately consider the two different time orderings and the different quark flavors in the electromagnetic current. We discuss in detail the behavior of the unwanted exponentials contributing to the three-point functions, as well as the choice of fit models and fit ranges used to remove them for various values of the virtuality. While positive photon virtuality is relevant for decays to multiple charged leptons, negative photon virtuality suppresses soft contributions and is of interest in QCD-factorization studies of the form factors.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with Chern-Simons type interaction. This extension contains a new massive vector boson (Chern-Simons boson) that does not interact directly with fermions of the SM. We consider the effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with fermions of the SM and its renormalizability in an arbitrary gauge. Our analysis shows that loop divergences cannot be eliminated in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions of the same flavor, whereas the effective loop interaction with fermions of different flavors remains well-defined. The interaction terms between the Chern-Simons boson and fermions of the same flavor, characterised by divergent prefactors, have been identified. These interactions should be treated within the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic composite Higgs model and gravitational waves produced during first order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft-wall holographic composite Higgs model assumes first-order phase transition from the dynamical inner symmetry breaking. This research focuses on the implications of the semi-analytical perturbative solution of the dual 5-dimensional theory as an effective description of the strongly coupled composite Higgs sector. We clarify the thermodynamical description and gravitational waves spectrum produced during the phase transition, which were previously numerically estimated. Besides, we investigate the limits of the applicability of our solution within the thin-wall approximation and quasiclassical approach in terms of the dual theory, that correspond to the strongly coupled regime of composite Higgs model. Our semi-analytic framework provides description of the strong first-order phase transition within the runaway scenario.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes: WISPs in gamma-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide an overview of high-energy astrophysical processes involving axions, axion-like particles (ALPs), and other weakly interacting slim particles (WISPs) focusing on their potential observational signatures in astrophysical environments. After introducing key concepts in high-energy astrophysics, we present the fundamental properties of WISPs, emphasizing their phenomenological implications. Particular attention is given to ALP-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields and the possible decay signatures of ALPs in sources such as active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and cosmic-ray accelerators. These effects can lead to distinctive modifications in astrophysical spectra, spatial distributions, and polarization patterns, providing unique probes of physics beyond the Standard Model. We discuss their role in dark matter scenarios and their potential impact on high-energy observations. The lecture series is supplemented by hands-on tutorials, including exercises on axion electrodynamics and an analysis of gamma-ray data from NGC 1275 to search for ALP-photon conversion signatures.</description>

      <title>Study of the hottest droplet of fluid through correlations and fluctuations of collective variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we focus on the fluctuations and correlations of the collective observables such as the mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) and harmonic flow coefficients ($v_n$) of particles produced in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Specifically, we show that the fluctuations of harmonic flow can be probed by the factorization-breaking coefficients between flow vectors in different $p_T$-bins. Experimental difficulty can be reduced by taking one of the flow vectors momentum averaged. Fluctuations cause a decorrelation between the flow vectors, which can be attributed to equal contributions from the flow magnitude and flow angle decorrelation. We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultra-central collisions and show that our model can explain the steep fall of its variance observed by the ATLAS collaboration. We also present robust predictions for the skewness and kurtosis, and highlight the role of impact parameter fluctuations in ultracentral collisions. We study the Pearson correlation coefficients between $[p_T]$ and $v_n^2$, which can map the initial state correlations between the shape and size of the fireball. We show that higher order normalized and symmetric cumulants between these observables can be constructed, which put useful additional constraints on the initial state properties. Furthermore, we study the momentum dependent Pearson correlation between $[p_T]$ and the transverse momentum dependent flow. It shows sensitivity to the Gaussian width of the nucleon at the initial state. Finally, we show that such correlations and fluctuations of collective observables can be used to study nuclear deformation and put robust constraints on their deformation parameters through high energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Topology and the Infrared Structure of Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics using geometric phases and the adiabatic approximation in quantum field theory. In this framework, the asymptotic \textit{in} and \textit{out} states are modified by Berry phases, $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{in}}}$ and $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{out}}}$, which encode the infrared structure non-perturbatively and regulate soft-photon divergences.
  Unlike the Faddeev--Kulish formalism, which employs perturbative dressing with coherent states, our approach reformulates the effective action in terms of Berry connections in field space. This yields finite, gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes without requiring a sum over soft-photon emissions.
  We show that infrared divergences cancel to all orders in the bremsstrahlung vertex function $\Gamma^\mu(p_1, p_2)$, due to destructive interference among inequivalent Berry phases. As an application, we study the formation of positronium in the infrared regime and argue that the dressed \(S\)-matrix exhibits a functional singularity at $s = 4 m_e^2$, corresponding to a physical pole generated by topological flux.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, a valence pion mass of 690 MeV, and high levels of gauge link smearing. Despite the physics effects of the large-pion mass and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the modified gravity corrections. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Wonderings on Wiggly Bispectra: Non-linear Evolution and Reconstruction of Oscillations in the Squeezed Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario. These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this work, we study how oscillations of the form $\lim_{q\ll k}B(q,k)\propto \cos(\mu \ln(q/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively erasing the signal on scales $k \gtrsim 0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$. This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum is suppressed by a factor of $(q/k)^{3/2}$ relative to the template studied here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1611.00013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework is presented for including second-order perturbative corrections to the radiation patterns of parton showers. The formalism allows to combine O(alphaS^2)-corrected iterated 2-&gt;3 kernels for "ordered" gluon emissions with tree-level 2-&gt;4 kernels for "unordered" ones. The combined Sudakov evolution kernel is thus accurate to O(alphaS^2). As a first step towards a full-fledged implementation of these ideas, we develop an explicit implementation of 2-&gt;4 shower branchings in this letter.</description>

Abstract: We present the first complete two loop calculation of the electron EDM in the complex two-Higgs doublet model. We confirm gauge-independence by demonstrating analytic cancellation of the gauge parameter $\xi$ in the background field gauge and the 't Hooft $R_\xi$ gauge. We also investigate the behavior of the electron EDM near the decoupling limit, and determine the short- and long-distance contributions by matching onto an effective field theory. Compared with earlier studies of the electron EDM in the complex two-Higgs doublet model, we note disagreements in several places and provide diagnoses where possible. We also provide expressions for EDMs of light quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the possibility of having a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the inspired Froggatt-Nielsen Singlet Model (iFNSM) wherein a direct connection exists between the DM mass and new flavon symmetry-breaking scale. We find a considerable allowed region of parameter space for the ensuing pseudoscalar DM, which is dependent upon the flavon Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and Yukawa couplings, over which it may be possible to explain the fermion mass hierarchy. Finally, we choose a Benchmark Point (BP) and perform detailed collider analyses to probe this DM state in the context of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Specifically, in this model, one obtains large missing transverse energy ($\slashed{E}_T$) when the DM particle is resonantly produced from the decay of a heavy Higgs field, along with multiple jets from Initial State Radiation (ISR). Thus, the ensuing $\slashed{E}_T$ + $n\, {\rm jets}~(n \geq 1)$ signature is an excellent probe of DM in this construct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the new $Z'$ boson as a portal for the production of Higgs bosons $h_0$ and $H_0$ predicted by the Bestest Little Higgs Model through the Higgs-strahlung processes $\mu^+\mu^- \to (Z, Z') \to Zh_0, ZH_0$. We focus on the resonance and non-resonance effects of the $Zh_0, ZH_0$ signals. In our analysis, we consider the center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=3, 4, 6, 10, 30$ TeV and integrated luminosities of ${\cal L}=2, 4, 6, 10, 30$ ${\rm ab^{-1}}$ projected for a future muon collider. The possibility of performing precision measurements for the Higgs bosons $h_0$ and $H_0$ is very promising at the future muon collider. Furthermore, our results may be helpful to the High Energy Physics community. Complementarily, we generate and provide the Feynman rules necessary for studying the processes $\mu^+\mu^- \to (Z, Z') \to Zh_0, ZH_0$.</description>

      <title>Gluonic contributions to the pion parton distribution functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of a dynamical gluon in the pion within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework and compare it with the solution of the Minkowski space Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), focusing on contributions beyond the valence sector. We develop a framework to compute the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, starting from its valence light-front wave function. Additionally, the quark and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are derived by considering this higher Fock component in the pion state. The proposed operator, which acts on the valence state to produce the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, is tested against results from BLFQ for its contribution to the quark and gluon PDFs, as well as with results from the BSE. In the BLFQ framework, we identify the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the pion structure through the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element. This enhancement is captured in the $|q\bar{q}g\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and the associated gluon PDF. We explicitly demonstrate an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF, which is associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, which also drives the $\pi-\rho$ mass splitting. The proposed framework also enables an exploration of the effect of the dressed gluon mass for a given valence state at the pion scale. We show that when the gluon mass vanishes, departing from the constituent gluon picture, it has a significant impact on the gluon PDF.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter with the Th-229 nuclear lineshape from laser spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the low-lying Th-229 isomer transition is starting a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by Tiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al. [Nature 663, 63 (2024)] to surpass it.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>

Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>

      <title>Constraints on non-unitary neutrino mixing in light of atmospheric and reactor neutrino data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the origin of neutrino masses remains unknown, several key neutrino mass generation models result in a non-unitary three-neutrino mixing matrix. To put such models to test, the deviations of the mixing matrix from unitarity can be measured directly through neutrino oscillation experiments. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of the non-unitary mixing model using the recent public data from atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments - namely IceCube-DeepCore, Daya Bay, and KamLAND. The novelty of our approach compared to the preceding global fits for non-unitarity is in the detailed treatment of the atmospheric neutrino data, which for the first time includes the relevant flux and detector systematic uncertainties. From the Bayesian posteriors on the individual mixing matrix elements, we derive the non-unitarity constraints in the form of normalisations and closures of the mixing matrix rows and columns, assuming either a fully unconstrained matrix or a physically motivated submatrix scenario. We find comparable constraints for electron and tau row normalisations as other similar studies in literature, and additionally reveal strong correlations between muon and tau row constraints induced by the atmospheric systematic uncertainties. We find that the current data is well described by both unitary and non-unitary mixing models, with a strong preference for the unitary mixing indicated by the Bayes factor. With the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade and JUNO detectors, both featuring superior energy resolution compared to the current atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments, our constraints on the row normalisations in the submatrix case are expected to improve by 25%, 40%, and 20% in the electron, muon, and tau sectors respectively.</description>

      <title>Explaining Snowball-in-hell Phenomena in Heavy-ion Collisions Using a Novel Thermodynamic Variable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a ``snowball in hell'' since it emerges from a hadron resonance gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the ``contact'' that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron resonance gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows $v_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat \gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow $v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play in this process.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Aspects of Dark Matter Axions and Dark Photons Transitioning to Photons in a Resonant Cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When axion cold dark matter interacts with a static magnetic field, it can be converted to photons with energy near the axion's mass. Classical analysis shows that incorporating a resonant cavity significantly enhances this conversion rate, forming the basis for many experiments aimed at detecting dark matter axions. However, one might ask: Does the axion-photon conversion rate increase for a single axion-photon transition? Answering this question could lead to optimizing the search for axions by integrating quantum measurement techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate that at the quantum level, single axion-photon transitions are amplified by the cavity quality factor $Q$. Furthermore, the coherence of dark matter waves is unnecessary during the measurement. The underlying principle is similar to the Purcell effect. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the scenario involving dark photon dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assume the coupling of Axion-like particle (ALP) to diphoton $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 0$ and accomplish detailed analyses for the $\gamma Z$ decay mode of such heavy photophobic ALPs at the high luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). ALPs are produced with two jets via both the $s$-channel vector boson exchange and vector boson fusion processes, with the signal process $pp \to jj\, a (\to \gamma\, Z (\to \ell^+ \ell^-)\, ) $ for $\ell = e, \mu$. Signal and background events are simulated at the detector-level. Preselection criteria target events with one photon, two oppositely charged electrons or muons, and two non-$b$-tagged jets. The ALP mass is reconstructed, and kinematic observables are input into a machine learning-based multivariate analysis for optimal background rejection. Discover sensitivities on the ALP's coupling to di-$W$ boson, $g_{aWW}$, are presented in the mass range from 100 to 4000 GeV at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ 3 ab$^{-1}$ and 140 fb$^{-1}$. Sensitivities on the production cross section $\sigma (pp \to jj\, a)$ times the branching ratio Br$(a \to \gamma Z)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-standard neutrino interactions with neutral current events at long-baseline oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore, for the first time, {\textit{neutral-current}} events at long-baseline experiments to constrain vector and axial-vector neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) with quarks. We leverage the flavor dependence of NSIs to perform an oscillation analysis in the neutral-current channel. We first introduce a framework to parametrize the effect of NSI on the cross section. Then, as an example, we analyze NOvA neutral-current data which provides significantly improved constraints on the axial-vector NSI parameters $\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}^A,~\varepsilon_{\tau\tau}^A$ and $\varepsilon_{e\mu}^A$. This is highly complementary to constraints from SNO data, which, differently from long-baseline neutral current data, is not sensitive to isospin conserving NSIs $\varepsilon^A_u=\varepsilon^A_d$. Additionally, we disfavor large values of the diagonal vectorial NSI $\varepsilon_{\mu\mu}^V$ and
  \varepsilon_{\tau\tau}^V$ which originate from the LMA-Dark solution. We also highlight the complementarity between NSI searches at oscillation experiments using charged current and neutral current channels.</description>

Abstract: It is widely observed that particles produced in high-energy collisions follow a power-law distribution. One such power-law distribution used extensively in the phenomenological studies owes its origin to nonadditive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this article, we derive a novel nonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using a single-mode harmonic oscillator. The approach taken in this paper eliminates the need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. We observe that the spectra of the bosonic particles like the pions and kaons produced in high-energy collisions are well-described by the nonadditive bosonic distribution derived in this paper.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Portal Dark Matter Detection Prospects at a Future Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With no concrete evidence for non-gravitational interactions of dark matter to date, it is natural to wonder whether dark matter couples predominantly to the Standard Model (SM)'s neutrinos. Neutrino interactions (and the possible existence of additional neutrinophilic mediators) are substantially less understood than those of other SM particles, yet this picture will change dramatically in the coming decades with new neutrino sources. One potential new source arises with the construction of a high-energy muon collider (MuCol) -- due to muons' instability, a MuCol is a source of high-energy collimated neutrinos. Importantly, since the physics of muon decays (into neutrinos) is very well-understood, this leads to a neutrino flux with systematic uncertainties far smaller than fluxes from conventional high-energy (proton-sourced) neutrino beams. In this work, we study the capabilities of a potential neutrino detector, "MuCol$\nu$," placed ~100 m downstream of the MuCol interaction point. The MuCol$\nu$ detector would be especially capable of searching for a neutrinophilic mediator $\phi$ through the mono-neutrino scattering process $\nu_\mu N \to \mu^+ \phi X$, exceeding searches from other terrestrial approaches for $m_\phi$ in the ~few MeV -- ten GeV range. Even with a 10 kg-yr exposure, MuCol$\nu$ is capable of searching for well-motivated classes of thermal freeze-out and freeze-in neutrino-portal dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, using both numerical and analytical arguments and methods, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at its minimal value. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a grand unified model in five dimensions that addresses the strong CP problem. In this framework, the boundary conditions that break the unified gauge group into the Standard Model gauge group simultaneously explain the mass splitting of the new matter content required for gauge coupling unification and the emergence of the QCD axion as the $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ gauge field. The quality of the axion solution is inherently ensured by the gauge symmetry of the model. We further investigate the implications of this setup, including its predictions for the proton decay rate, the detectability of axion dark matter, and its cosmological impact. Notably, the model predicts a proton decay signal within the sensitivity of upcoming experiments, a result driven by the trade-off between the unification scale and the reheating temperature. In our scenario, the scales of grand unification and the axion decay constant are naturally unified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the additional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct relic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In this work we introduce a $Z_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM framework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of contributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic abundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct detection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars and the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results demonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing limitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for detection in current and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Are the new particles heavy or light in $b \to s E_{\mathrm{miss}}$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the $B^+\to K^+ E_{\mathrm{miss}}$, $B^0\to K^{*0} E_{\mathrm{miss}}$, and $\Lambda_b^0\to \Lambda^0 E_{\mathrm{miss}}$ decays under three different new physics hypotheses: the heavy new particles, the light neutral vector particles, and the axion-like particles. We find that all three hypotheses can resolve the Belle-II excess, and they can be clearly distinguished by the longitudinal polarization fraction of $K^*$. Furthermore, we discover that the longitudinal polarization fraction of $\Lambda$ can be used to distinguish the chirality of the effective operators.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-6}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the mass spectra of triply heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions of $\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{bbc}$ baryons are firstly analyzed in the present work. The calculations are carried out in the frame work of relativized quark model, where the baryon is regarded as a real three-quark system. Our results show that the excited energy of charmed-bottom triply baryons are always associated with heavier quark. This means the lowest state of $\Omega_{ccb}$ baryon is dominated by the $\lambda$-mode, however, the dominant orbital excitation for $\Omega_{bbc}$ baryon is $\rho$-mode. In addition, the influence of configuration mixing on mass spectrum, which is induced by different angular momentum assignments, is also analyzed. It shows that energy of the lowest state will be further lowered by this mixing effect. According to this conclusion, we systematically analyze the mass spectra of the ground and excited states($1S\sim4S$, $1P\sim4P$, $1D\sim4D$, $1F\sim4F$ and $1G\sim4G$) of $\Omega_{ccb}$, $\Omega_{bbc}$, $\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons. Finally, with the predicated mass spectra, the Regge trajectories of these heavy baryons in the ($J$,$M^{2}$) plane are constructed.</description>

      <title>Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the first non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles (one mock nucleon plus two mock pions or two mock nucleons plus one mock anti-nucleon). The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.
  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\zeta, \Delta^2_\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark symmetry behind $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality violations in semileptonic $b \to c$ transitions have garnered attention over a decade. For $R_{H_c}={\rm{BR}}(H_b\to H_c \tau\bar\nu_\tau)/{\rm{BR}}(H_b\to H_c \ell\bar\nu_\ell)$ with $\ell$ being $e,\, \mu$, a sum rule among $R_{D}$, $R_{D^*}$ and $R_{\Lambda_c}$ was proposed to check consistency in the experimental results independently of new physics models. We revisit this relation from the perspective of the heavy quark symmetry. We derive a sum rule holding exactly in the heavy quark limit and clarify how model-dependent corrections are introduced in a realistic situation.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ productions in $\pi^{-} p$ scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we propose to investigate the productions of $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ in the $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow D^{-} D^{0} p$ processes by utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach, where $\Lambda_c(2910)$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)$ are considered as $D^\ast N$ molecular states with $J^P$ quantum numbers to be $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$, respectively. With the cutoff parameter determined by the upper limit of the cross sections for $\pi^- p \to D^{\ast-} \Lambda_c(2286)$, the ratios of the cross sections for $\pi^- p \to D^{\ast-} \Lambda_c(2286)$, $\pi^- p \to D^{-} \Lambda_c(2286)$, $\pi^- p \to D^{-} \Lambda_c(2910)$, and $\pi^- p \to D^{-} \Lambda_c(2940)$ are estimated to be $1:4.8:1.42:0.26$ at $p_\pi=30$ GeV. Considering that the $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ state can further decay into $D^{0}p$, we estimate the cross sections for $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow D^{-} D^{0} p$ process and the differential cross sections depending on the $D^0 p$ invariant mass spectrum. Our estimations indicate that the total cross sections are $(0.49^{+1.56}_{-0.38})$ nb when $p_{\pi}=15~\mathrm{GeV}$, where the uncertainties result from the variation of the $\Lambda_{r}$. By comparing the contributions of the $s$, $u$, and $t$-channels, we conclude that the $t$-channel plays the predominant role. Moreover, the present estimations suggest that the structure around 2.9 GeV in the $D^0 p$ invariant mass spectrum of the $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow D^{-} D^{0} p$ process should correspond to $\Lambda_c(2910)$ rather than $\Lambda_c(2940)$, which can be tested by further experimental measurements at J-PARC in the future.</description>

      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide analytical results for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and vector meson spin alignment, respectively. We compare our results with recent experimental data from ALICE collaboration for $D^{*+}$ meson and provide predictions for spin polarization of open charm baryons. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of singly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous calculation of the spin-orbit terms in the three-quark system is preliminarily realized based on the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions in the frame work of the relativized quark model, by ignoring the mixing between different excited states. Then, the complete mass spectra of the singly heavy baryons are obtained rigorously, under the mechanism of the heavy-quark dominance. On these bases, the systematical analyses are carried out for the reliability and predictive power of the model, the fine structure of the singly heavy baryon spectra, the assignments of the excited baryons, and some important topics about the heavy baryon spectroscopy such as the missing states, the `spin-orbit puzzle', the clustering effect, etc. The result confirms that under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, the relativized quark model can describe the excitation spectra and the fine structures of the singly heavy baryons correctly and precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observations of fully-charm tetraquark states in the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments suggested the existence of the hadronic molecules of two-charmonium states, which may also imply bound states in the three-charmonium systems. In this work, we study the possible bound states in the triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ systems with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$, respectively. In QCD sum rules, we calculate the two-point correlation functions and spectral functions up to the dimension-four gluon condensate. We use the iterative dispersion relation approach to deal with the five-loop banana integrals, which significantly improves the computational efficiency. Our results show that the masses of triple-$\eta_c$ and triple-$J/\psi$ states lie below the corresponding mass thresholds, supporting the existence of such three-body bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric on the space of collider physics data enables analysis of its geometrical properties, like dimensionality or curvature, as well as quantifying the density with which a finite, discrete ensemble of data samples the space. We provide the first systematically-improvable precision calculations on this dataspace, presenting predictions resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, using the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) as its metric. This is accomplished by demonstration of factorization of soft and collinear contributions to the metric at leading power and renormalization group evolution of the single-scale functions that are present in the factorization theorem. As applications of this general framework, we calculate the two-point correlator between pairs of jets on the dataspace, and the measure of the non-Gaussian fluctuations in a finite dataset. For the non-Gaussianities, our calculations validate the existence of a universal structure that had been previously observed in simulated data. As byproducts of this analysis, we also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension of the SEMD metric and show that the original Energy Mover's Distance metric is identical to the SEMD through next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>

      <title>Study of Heavy Hadron Production in Au + Au Collisions at a Center-of-Mass Energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model, the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra of $D^{0}$, $\overline{D}^{0}$, and $\Lambda_{c}$, as well as the nuclear modification factors of $D^{0}$ and $D^{\pm}$, produced in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV RHIC energy across various centrality bins, are presented. To achieve the best description of heavy hadron production, several input parameters in both the soft and hard components of the model are tuned. The model effectively reproduces experimental data of $p_{T}$ spectra at low and intermediate $p_{T}$, capturing key features of charm hadron production in the quark-gluon plasma medium. However, it overpredicts the data at high $p_{T}$, indicating the need for improvements in modeling heavy quark energy loss mechanisms. Further, the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$) for $D^{0}$ mesons exhibit significant suppression in central collisions, which matches with experimental observations. This highlights the roles of collisional and radiative energy loss due to collective effects, such as coalescence and radial flow. The antiparticle-to-particle and mixed particle ratios are also presented, showing good agreement with experimental data and revealing limitations in baryon production due to the absence of heavy quark coalescence in HYDJET++. Additionally, we compare the HYDJET++ results with other theoretical models, like TAMU, SUBATECH, Torino, Duke, and AMPT.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, I'll discuss two classes of effects--additional sources of CP violation and PQ breaking--that offer a slightly different take on axion physics. Both are tied to the idea that the axion solution to the strong CP problem might not be exact, hence the title ``Imperfect Axions''.</description>

Abstract: Space-borne quantum technologies, particularly those based on atom interferometry, are heralding a new era of strategic and robust space exploration. The unique conditions of space, characterized by low noise and low gravity environments, open up diverse possibilities for applications ranging from precise time and frequency transfer to Earth Observation and the search of new Physics. In this paper, we summarise the M-class mission proposal in response to the 2022 call in ESA's science program: Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-QUEST). It consists in a satellite mission featuring a dual-species atom interferometer operating over extended durations. This mission aims to tackle three of the most fundamental questions in Physics: (i) testing the universality of free fall with an accuracy better than one part in $10^{-17}$, (ii) exploring various forms of Ultra-Light Dark Matter, and (iii) scrutinizing the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. These bounds depend on the hierarchy of the masses in the theory such as whether or not the masses are at the similar orders. While the mass of the heaviest field in the hierarchy may not be constrained but it is shown that a combination of the masses of the fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that this combined mass scale is lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Connecting Inflation to the NANOGrav 15-year Data Set via Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rationale-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Jet Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC has opened a new window on high-energy particle physics and highlighted the potential of forward physics for groundbreaking discoveries. In the last year, the physics case for forward physics has continued to grow, and there has been extensive work on defining the Forward Physics Facility and its experiments to realize this physics potential in a timely and cost-effective manner. Following a 2-page Executive Summary, we present the status of the FPF, beginning with the FPF's unique potential to shed light on dark matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD, and astroparticle physics. We summarize the current designs for the Facility and its experiments, FASER2, FASER$\nu$2, FORMOSA, and FLArE, and conclude by discussing international partnerships and organization, and the FPF's schedule, budget, and technical coordination.</description>

      <title>Oscillons in AdS space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a box, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. In particular, as the AdS radius decreases, one can see a transition from a metastable oscillon to a stable oscillatory solution. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality.</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron -- a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity -- could account for all dark matter in the universe if its mass lies in the meV--MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we provide a detailed calculation of the scalaron's decay rate into two photons -- a one-loop process of significant interest that has been the subject of discrepancies in the literature. We demonstrate that a direct evaluation of loop diagrams with appropriate regularisation eliminates the ambiguities inherent in methods relying on Jacobians from field redefinitions. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by its decays into photons. We also estimate the contribution of primordial scalarons emitted in the hot early universe to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. Our results support all key aspects of the original scenario, in which scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</description>
