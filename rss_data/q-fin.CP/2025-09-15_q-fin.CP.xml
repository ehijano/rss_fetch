      <title>Meta-Learning Neural Process for Implied Volatility Surfaces with SABR-induced Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing the implied volatility surface (IVS) is reframed as a meta-learning problem training across trading days to learn a general process that reconstructs a full IVS from few quotes, eliminating daily recalibration. We introduce the Volatility Neural Process, an attention-based model that uses a two-stage training: pre-training on SABR-generated surfaces to encode a financial prior, followed by fine-tuning on market data. On S&amp;P 500 options (2006-2023; out-of-sample 2019-2023), our model outperforms SABR, SSVI, Gaussian Process, and an ablation trained only on real data. Relative to the ablation, the SABR-induced prior reduces RMSE by about 40% and dominates in mid- and long-maturity regions where quotes are sparse. The learned prior suppresses large errors, providing a practical, data-efficient route to stable IVS construction with a single deployable model.</description>

      <title>Analytic estimation of parameters of stochastic volatility diffusion models with exponential-affine characteristic function for currency option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation develops and justifies a novel method for deriving approximate formulas to estimate two parameters in stochastic volatility diffusion models with exponentially-affine characteristic functions and single- or two-factor variance. These formulas aim to improve the accuracy of option pricing and enhance the calibration process by providing reliable initial values for local minimization algorithms. The parameters relate to the volatility of the stochastic factor in instantaneous variance dynamics and the correlation between stochastic factors and asset price dynamics.
  The study comprises five chapters. Chapter one outlines the currency option market, pricing methods, and the general structure of stochastic volatility models. Chapter two derives the replication strategy dynamics and introduces a new two-factor volatility model: the OUOU model. Chapter three analyzes the distribution and surface dynamics of implied volatilities using principal component and common factor analysis. Chapter four discusses calibration methods for stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston model, and presents the new Implied Central Moments method to estimate parameters in the Heston and Sch\"obel-Zhu models. Extensions to two-factor models, Bates and OUOU, are also explored. Chapter five evaluates the performance of the proposed formulas on the EURUSD options market, demonstrating the superior accuracy of the new method.
  The dissertation successfully meets its research objectives, expanding tools for derivative pricing and risk assessment. Key contributions include faster and more precise parameter estimation formulas and the introduction of the OUOU model - an extension of the Sch\"obel-Zhu model with a semi-analytical valuation formula for European options, previously unexamined in the literature.</description>

      <title>Why Bonds Fail Differently? Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</description>
