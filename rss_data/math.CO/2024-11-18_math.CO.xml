      <title>The Perfect Matching Hamiltonian property in Prism and Crossed Prism graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ has the \emph{Perfect Matching Hamiltonian property} (or for short, $G$ is $PMH$) if, for each one of its perfect matchings, there is another perfect matching of $G$ such that the union of the two perfect matchings yields a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$. In this note, we show that \emph{Prism graphs} $\cP_n$ are not $PMH$, except for the $Cube\ graph$, and indicate for which values of $n$ the \emph{Crossed Prism graphs} $\cCP_n$ are $PMH$.</description>

      <title>Generating strongly 2-connected digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exist four operations such that given any two strongly $2$-connected digraphs $H$ and $D$ where $H$ is a butterfly-minor of $D$, there exists a sequence $D_0,\dots, D_n$ where $D_0=H$, $D_n=D$ and for every $0\leq i\leq n-1$, $D_i$ is a strongly $2$-connected butterfly-minor of $D_{i+1}$ which is obtained by a single application of one of the four operations.
  As a consequence of this theorem, we obtain that every strongly $2$-connected digraph can be generated from a concise family of strongly $2$-connected digraphs by using these four operations.</description>

      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results in the case of cycles of arbitrary length.</description>

      <title>Interval hypergraphic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hypergraph $\mathbb{H}$ on $[n]$, the hypergraphic poset $P_\mathbb{H}$ is the transitive closure of the oriented skeleton of the hypergraphic polytope $\triangle_\mathbb{H}$ (the Minkowski sum of the standard simplices $\triangle_H$ for all $H \in \mathbb{H}$). Hypergraphic posets include the weak order for the permutahedron (when $\mathbb{H}$ is the complete graph on $[n]$) and the Tamari lattice for the associahedron (when $\mathbb{H}$ is the set of all intervals of $[n]$), which motivates the study of lattice properties of hypergraphic posets. In this paper, we focus on interval hypergraphs, where all hyperedges are intervals of $[n]$. We characterize the interval hypergraphs $\mathbb{I}$ for which $P_\mathbb{I}$ is a lattice, a distributive lattice, a semidistributive lattice, and a lattice quotient of the weak order.</description>

      <title>Bijectivizing the PT-DT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pandharipande-Thomas theory and Donaldson-Thomas theory (PT and DT) are two branches of enumerative geometry in which particular generating functions arise that count plane-partition-like objects. That these generating functions differ only by a factor of MacMahon's function was proven recursively by Jenne, Webb, and Young using the double dimer model. We bijectivize two special cases of the result by formulating these generating functions using vertex operators and applying a particular type of local involution known as a toggle, first introduced in the form we use by Pak.</description>

      <title>Completing partial $k$-star designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-star is a complete bipartite graph $K_{1,k}$. A partial $k$-star design of order $n$ is a pair $(V,\mathcal{A})$ where $V$ is a set of $n$ vertices and $\mathcal{A}$ is a set of edge-disjoint $k$-stars whose vertex sets are subsets of $V$. If each edge of the complete graph with vertex set $V$ is in some star in $\mathcal{A}$, then $(V,\mathcal{A})$ is a (complete) $k$-star design. We say that $(V,\mathcal{A})$ is completable if there is a $k$-star design $(V,\mathcal{B})$ such that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. In this paper we determine, for all $k$ and $n$, the minimum number of stars in an uncompletable partial $k$-star design of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Which $L$-cospectral graphs have same degree sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda_{i}(G)$ be the $i$-th largest Laplacian eigenvalues of graph $G$, where $1\le i\le |V(G)|$. Liu, Yuan, You and Chen [Discrete Math., 341 (2018) 2969--2976] raised the problem for ``Which cospectral graphs have same degree sequences". In this paper, let $W_3$ and $W_5$ be the two graphs as shown in Fig. 2 and let $G$ be a connected graph with $n\ge 18$ vertices. We shall show that:
  $(1)$ If $\lambda_{2}(G)&lt;5&lt;n-1&lt;\lambda_{1}(G)$, $\lambda_{1}(G) \notin \{\lambda_{1}(W_3),\lambda_{1}(W_5)\}$ and $H$ is Laplacian cospectral with $G$, then $H$ must have the same degree sequence with $G$;
  $(2)$ If $\lambda_2(G)\le 4.7&lt;n-2&lt; \lambda_1(G)$, and $H$ is Laplacian cospectral with $G$, then $H$ must have the same degree sequence with $G$.
  The former result easily leads to the unique theorem result of [Discrete Math., 308 (2008) 4267--4271], that is: Every multi-fan graph $K_1\vee (P_{l_1}\cup P_{l_1}\cup\cdots \cup P_{l_t})$ is determined by the Laplacian spectrum. Moreover, it can also deduce a new conclusion: $K_1\vee (P_{l_1}\cup P_{l_1}\cup\cdots \cup P_{l_t}\cup C_{s_1}\cup C_{s_2}\cup\cdots \cup C_{s_k})$ $(t\ge 1, k\ge 1)$ is determined by the Laplacian spectrum if the graph order $n\ge 18$ and each $s_i$ $(i=1,2,\ldots, k)$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Explicit constructions of optimal blocking sets and minimal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong $s$-blocking set in a projective space is a set of points that intersects each codimension-$s$ subspace in a spanning set of the subspace. We present an explicit construction of such sets in a $(k - 1)$-dimensional projective space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of size $O_s(q^s k)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor depending on $s$. This also yields an optimal explicit construction of affine blocking sets in $\mathbb{F}_q^k$ with respect to codimension-$(s+1)$ affine subspaces, and of $s$-minimal codes. Our approach is motivated by a recent construction of Alon, Bishnoi, Das, and Neri of strong $1$-blocking sets, which uses expander graphs with a carefully chosen set of vectors as their vertex set. The main novelty of our work lies in constructing specific hypergraphs on top of these expander graphs, where tree-like configurations correspond to strong $s$-blocking sets. We also discuss some connections to size-Ramsey numbers of hypergraphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider equilibrium one-on-one conversations between neighbors on a circular table, with the goal of assessing the likelihood of a (perhaps) familiar situation: sitting at a table where both of your neighbors are talking to someone else. When $n$ people in a circle randomly prefer their left or right neighbor, we show that the probability a given person is unmatched in equilibrium (i.e., in a stable matching) is $$\frac{1}{9} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\left(\frac{2n}{3} - \frac{8}{9} + \frac{2}{n}\right)$$ for odd $n$ and $$\frac{1}{9} - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\left(\frac{2n}{3} - \frac{8}{9}\right)$$ for even $n$. This probability approaches $1/9$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We also show that the probability \textit{every} person is matched in equilibrium is $0$ for odd $n$ and $\frac{3^{n/2}-1}{2^{n-1}}$ for even $n$.</description>

      <title>Exclusivity principle, Ramsey theory, and $n$-cycle PR boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exclusivity principle (E-principle) states that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. Unlike other principles proposed to characterize quantum correlations, its intrinsically non-bipartite formulation enables its application in more general contextuality scenarios. Although equivalent to the no-signalling condition for any bipartite Bell scenario, this equivalence breaks down for two independent copies of the same scenario. Such violations of the E-principle due to multiple copies, known as its activation effect, was studied in [Nat Commun 4, 2263 (2013)] for the nonlocal extremal boxes of $(2,m,2)$, $(2,2,d)$, and $(3,2,2)$ Bell scenarios. The authors mapped the problem of exhibiting activation effects to finding certain cliques inside joint exclusivity graphs. In this work, we refine the joint exclusivity structure to be an edge-colored exclusivity multigraph. This allows us to draw a novel connection to Ramsey theory, which guarantees the existence of certain monochromatic subgraphs in sufficiently large edge-colored cliques, providing a powerful tool for ruling out E-principle violations. We then exploit this connection, drawing on Ramsey-theoretic results to study violations of the E-principle by multiple copies of the contextual extremal boxes of $n$-cycle scenarios, called $n$-cycle PR boxes, for the usual ($n=4$) PR box we show that the known E-principle violation of $5/4$ is the maximal achievable using two copies, and that this same upper bound applies to two copies of the KCBS ($n = 5$) PR box. We then prove that $n \geq 6$-cycle PR boxes, unlike the extremal boxes of the aforementioned Bell scenarios, do not exhibit activation effects with two or three copies. Finally, for any number of independent copies $k$, we establish a lower bound on $n$ above which $n$-cycle PR boxes do not exhibit activation effects with $k$ copies.</description>

Abstract: Let $w$ be a finite word over the alphabet $\{0,1\}$. For any natural number $n$, let $s_w(n)$ denote the number of occurrence of $w$ in the binary expansion of $n$ as a scattered subsequence. We study the behavior of the partial sum $\sum_{n=0}^N(-1)^{s_w(n)}$ and characterize several classes of words $w$ satisfying $\sum_{n=0}^N(-1)^{s_w(n)}= O(N^{1-\epsilon})$ for some $\epsilon &gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Bounded degree QBF and positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of SAT and its variants has provided numerous NP-complete problems, from which most NP-hardness results were derived. Due to the NP-hardness of SAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or to obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of several problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also NP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions even with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a function of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for QBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of a maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However, surprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided in polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct consequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter positional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree hypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Insights from a workshop on gamification of research in mathematics and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can outreach inspire and lead to research and vice versa? In this work, we introduce our approach to the gamification of research in mathematics and computer science through three illustrative examples. We discuss our primary motivations and provide insights into what makes our proposed gamification effective for three research topics in discrete and computational geometry and topology: (1) DominatriX, an art gallery problem involving polyominoes with rooks and queens; (2) Cubical Sliding Puzzles, an exploration of the discrete configuration spaces of sliding puzzles on the $d$-cube with topological obstructions; and (3) The Fence Challenge, a participatory isoperimetric problem based on polyforms. Additionally, we report on the collaborative development of the game Le Carr\'e du Diable, inspired by The Fence Challenge and created during the workshop Let's talk about outreach!, held in October 2022 in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. All of our outreach encounters and creations are designed and curated with an inclusive culture and a strong commitment to welcoming the most diverse audience possible.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases, resolutions, and the Lefschetz properties for powers of a general linear form in the squarefree algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the almost complete intersection ideals $(x_1^2, \dots, x_n^2, (x_1 + \cdots + x_n)^k)$, we compute their reduced Gr\"obner basis for any term ordering, revealing a combinatorial structure linked to lattice paths, elementary symmetric polynomials, and Catalan numbers. Using this structure, we classify the weak Lefschetz property for these ideals. Additionally, we provide a new proof of the well-known result that the squarefree algebra satisfies the strong Lefschetz property. Finally, we compute the Betti numbers of the initial ideals and construct a minimal free resolution using a Mayer-Vietoris tree approach.</description>

      <title>Chevalley Polytopes and Newton-Okounkov Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of polytopes, which we call Chevalley polytopes, associated to homogeneous spaces $X=G/P$ in their projective embeddings $X\hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}(V_{\varpi})$ together with a choice of reduced expression for the minimal coset representative $w^P$ of $w_0$ in $W/W_P$. When $X$ is minuscule in its minimal embedding, we describe our construction in terms of order polytopes of minuscule posets and use the associated combinatorics to show that minuscule Chevalley polytopes are Newton-Okounkov bodies for $X$ and that the Pl\"ucker coordinates on $X$ form a Khovanskii basis for $\mathbb{C}[X]$. We conjecture similar properties for general $X$ and general embeddings $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}(V_\varpi)$, along with a remarkable decomposition property which we consider as a polytopal shadow of the Littlewood-Richardson rule. We highlight a connection between Chevalley polytopes and string polytopes and give examples where Chevalley polytopes possess better combinatorial properties than string polytopes. We conclude with several examples further illustrating and supporting our conjectures.</description>

      <title>On commuting pairs in arbitrary sets of 2x2 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any finitely--supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$, we prove that either \[ T(\mu) = \sum_{X, Y \in {\rm supp}(\mu), XY = YX} \mu(X) \mu(Y) &lt; \varepsilon \] or there exists some finite set $S$ contained in a $2$-dimensional subspace of $\textrm{Mat}_2(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\mu(S) \gg \varepsilon^{3}$. We prove quantitatively stronger results when \[ \mu ( (a_{i,j})_{1\leq i,j \leq 2}) = \nu(a_{1,1}) \dots \nu(a_{2,2}) \ \ \text{for every} \ a_{1,1}, \dots, a_{2,2} \in \mathbb{R}, \]
  with $\nu$ being some finitely--supported probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. For instance, when $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a proper generalised arithmetic progression of dimension $d$, and $\nu = 1_{A}/|A|$, our methods imply that $T(\mu) \ll_d |A|^{-3}$. This is optimal up to the $O_d(1)$ factor. Our proofs involve incidence geometric techniques as well as ideas surrounding the recent progress on Bourgain--Chang type sum-product estimates over $\mathbb{R}$. The latter includes Schmidt's subspace theorem and the resolution of the weak polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We exhibit a family of valuated matroids that are not R-minor based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.</description>

      <title>On the maximum second eigenvalue of outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $k$ and a graph $G$, let $\lambda_k(G)$ denote the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. In 2017, Tait and Tobin proved that the maximum $\lambda_1(G)$ among all outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices is achieved by the fan graph $K_1\vee P_{n-1}$. In this paper, we consider a similar problem of determining the maximum $\lambda_2$ among all connected outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices. For $n$ even and sufficiently large, we prove that the maximum $\lambda_2$ is uniquely achieved by the graph $(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})\!\!-\!\!(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$, which is obtained by connecting two disjoint copies of $(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$ through a new edge joining their smallest degree vertices. When $n$ is odd and sufficiently large, the extremal graphs are not unique. The extremal graphs are those graphs $G$ that contain a cut vertex $u$ such that $G\setminus \{u\}$ is isomorphic to $2(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$. We also determine the maximum $\lambda_2$ among all 2-connected outerplanar graphs and asymptotically determine the maximum of $\lambda_k(G)$ among all connected outerplanar graphs for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Subspace Profiles over Finite Fields and $q$-Whittaker Expansions of Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey posed the problem of counting the number of subspaces which have a given profile with respect to a linear endomorphism defined on a finite vector space. Several special cases of this problem have been solved in the literature. We settle this problem in full generality by giving an explicit counting formula in terms of symmetric functions. This formula can be expressed compactly in terms a Hall scalar product involving dual $q$-Whittaker functions and another symmetric function that is determined by conjugacy class invariants of the linear endomorphism. As corollaries, we obtain new combinatorial interpretations for the coefficients in the $q$-Whittaker expansions of several symmetric functions. These include the power sum, complete homogeneous, products of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials and certain products of $q$-Whittaker functions. These results are used to derive a formula for the number of anti-invariant subspaces (as defined by Barr\'ia and Halmos) with respect to an arbitrary operator. We also give an application to an open problem in Krylov subspace theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Redistricting the $n\times n$ Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redistricting is the act of dividing a region into districts for electoral representation. Motivated by this application, we study two questions. How many ways are there to partition the $n\times n$ grid into $n$ contiguous districts of equal size? How many of these partitions are ``compact"? We give asymptotic bounds on the number of plans: a lower bound of roughly $1.41^{n^2}$ and an upper bound of roughly $3.21^{n^2}$. We then use the lower bound to show that most plans are not compact.</description>

Abstract: Complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) are combinatorial objects which appear in various contexts.Recently, Chen and Ohlig studied the notion of permutations associated to these objects, and proposed a series of nice conjectures.Most of them were proved by Selig and Zhu, through a connection with the abelian sandpile model.But one conjecture remained open, about the distribution of a natural statistic named determinant.We prove this conjecture, in a bijective way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segre products of posets were defined by Bj\"orner and Welker (2005). We investigate the homology representations of the $t$-fold Segre power $B_n^{(t)}$ of the Boolean lattice $B_n$. The direct product $\sym_n^{\times t}$ of the symmetric group $\sym_n$ acts on the homology of rank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$. We give an explicit formula for the decomposition into $\sym_n^{\times t}$-irreducibles of the homology of the full poset, as well as formulas for the diagonal action of the symmetric group $\sym_n$. For the rank-selected homology, we show that the stable principal specialisation of the product Frobenius characteristic of the $\sym_n^{\times t}$-module coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariant of the $t$-fold Segre power of the subspace lattice.</description>

      <title>Spanning $H$-subdivisions and perfect $H$-subdivision tilings in dense digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph $H$, we say a digraph $H^\prime$ is an $H$-subdivision if $H^\prime$ is obtained from $H$ by replacing one or more arcs from $H$ with internally vertex-disjoint path(s). In this paper, we prove that for any digraph $H$ with $h$ arcs and no isolated vertices, there is a constant $C_0&gt;0$ such that the following hold.
  $(1)$ For any integer $C\geq C_0$ and every digraph $D$ on $n\geq Ch$ vertices, if the minimum in- and out-degree of $D$ is at least $n/2$, then it contains an $H$-subdivision covering all vertices of $D$.
  $(2)$ For any integer partition $n=n_1+\cdots+n_m$ such that the sum of the $n_i$ less than $\alpha n$ is no more than $\beta n$, if a digraph $D$ has the order $n\geq Cm$ and the minimum in- and out-degree at least $\sum_{i=1}^m\lceil\frac{n_i}{2}\rceil$, then it contains $m$ disjoint $H$-subdivisions, where the order of these $H$-subdivisions is $n_1, \ldots, n_m$, respectively.
  The result of $(1)$ settles the conjecture raised by Pavez-Sign\'{e} \cite{Pavez} in a stronger form, and ameliorate the result of Lee \cite{Lee}. Also, the conclusion of $(2)$ partly answers of the conjecture of Lee \cite{Lee1} and generalizes the recent work of Lee \cite{Lee1}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we stated conjectural presentations for the equivariant quantum K ring of partial flag varieties, motivated by physics considerations. In this companion paper, we analyze these presentations mathematically. We start by proving a Nakayama type result for quantum K theory: if the conjectured set of relations deforms a complete set of relations of the classical K theory ring, then they must form a complete set of relations for the quantum K ring. We prove the conjectured presentation in the case of the incidence varieties, and we show that if a quantum K divisor axiom holds (as conjectured by Buch and Mihalcea), then the conjectured presentation also holds for the complete flag variety. Finally, we briefly revisit the change of variables relating the mathematics and physics presentations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Genus Algorithm Based on Graph Rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a given finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}({2^{(n^2+3n)}}/{n^{(n+1)}})$ steps. This algorithm avoids the difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of properties that make it useful for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of the optimal embedding, it outputs a proof certificate for verification and it can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>
