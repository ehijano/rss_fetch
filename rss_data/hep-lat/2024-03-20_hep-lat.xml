      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG).</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of heavy hybrid quarkonia and $\overline{b}gc$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrids $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling critical behavior in three-dimensional lattice Abelian gauge models with charged $N$-component scalar fields and $SO(N)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs gauge model for a charged $N$-component scalar field ${\phi}$, which is invariant under $SO(N)$ global transformations for generic values of the parameters. We focus on the strong-coupling regime, in which the kinetic Hamiltonian term for the gauge field is a small perturbation, which is irrelevant for the critical behavior. The Hamiltonian depends on a parameter $v$ which determines the global symmetry of the model and the symmetry of the low-temperature phases. We present renormalization-group predictions, based on a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective description that relies on the identification of the appropriate order parameter and on the symmetry-breaking patterns that occur at the strong-coupling phase transitions. For $v=0$, the global symmetry group of the model is $SU(N)$; the corresponding model may undergo continuous transitions only for $N=2$. For $v\not=0$, i.e., in the $SO(N)$ symmetric case, continuous transitions (in the Heisenberg universality class) are possible also for $N=3$ and 4. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for $N=2,3,4,6$, to verify the renormalization-group predictions. Finite-size scaling analyses of the numerical data are in full agreement.</description>

      <title>Decays of $1^{-+}$ Charmoniumlike Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extracting the transition amplitudes, we give the first lattice QCD prediction of the two-body decay partial widths of the $1^{-+}$ charmoniumlike hybrid $\eta_{c1}$. Given the calculated mass value $m_{\eta_{c1}}=4.329(36)$ GeV, the $\eta_{c1}$ decay is dominated by the open charm modes $D_1\bar{D}$, $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ with partial widths of $258(133)$ MeV, $88(18)$ MeV and $150(118)$ MeV, respectively. The coupling of $\eta_{c1}$ to $\chi_{c1}$ plus a flavor singlet pseudoscalar is not small, but $\chi_{c1}\eta$ decay is suppressed by the small $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle. The partial width of $\eta_{c1}\to \eta_c\eta'$ is estimated to be around 1 MeV. We suggest experiments to search for $\eta_{c1}$ in the $P$-wave $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ systems. Especially, the polarization of $D^*\bar{D}^*$ can be used to distinguish the $1^{-+}$ product (total spin $S=1$) from $1^{--}$ products ($S=0$).</description>

      <title>Study of topological quantities of lattice QCD by a modified Wasserstein generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modified Wasserstein generative adversarial network (M-WGAN) is proposed to study the distribution of the topological charge in lattice QCD based on the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We construct new generator and discriminator in M-WGAN to support the generation of high-quality distribution. Our results show that the M-WGAN scheme of the Machine learning should be helpful for us to calculate efficiently the 1D distribution of topological charge compared with the results by the MC simulation alone.</description>

      <title>A lattice formulation of Weyl fermions on a single curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard lattice domain-wall fermion formulation, one needs two flat domain-walls where both of the left- and right-handed massless modes appear. In this work we investigate a single domain-wall system with a nontrivial curved background. Specifically we consider a massive fermion on a three-dimensional square lattice, whose domain-wall is a two-dimensional sphere. In the free theory, we find that a single Weyl fermion is localized at the wall and it feels gravity through the induced spin connection. With a topologically nontrivial $U(1)$ link gauge field, however, we find a zero mode with the opposite chirality localized at the center where the gauge field is singular. In the latter case, the low-energy effective theory is not chiral but vectorlike. We discuss how to circumvent this obstacle in formulating lattice chiral gauge theory in the single domain-wall fermion system.</description>

      <title>$B$-meson semileptonic decays from highly improved staggered quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an update for results on $B$-meson semileptonic decays using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action for both valence and 2+1+1 sea quarks. The use of the highly improved action, combined with the MILC collaboration's gauge ensembles with lattice spacings down to $\sim$0.03 fm, allows the $b$ quark to be treated with the same discretization as the lighter quarks. The talk will focus on updated results for $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)}$, $B_{(s)} \to K$ scalar and vector form factors.</description>
