      <title>Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices and study the effects of helicoidal gauge potential on the population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states for zero and non-zero Zeeman splitting. We see that the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation for zero Zeeman splitting and the frequency of oscillation increases with the decrease of strength of helicoidal gauge potential. In presence of optical lattices, the frequency further increases. However, the increment of frequency depends on wavenumber of the lattice. For non-zero Zeeman splitting, we find that the oscillation of population imbalance is not symmetric about zero imbalance of the two states. The asymmetry increases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and Zeeman splitting. However, it decreases with the increase of initial phase difference.</description>

      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits -- where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations -- are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state or, more generally, an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, in order to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit with finite recurrence time. With the aid of a suitable classical limit, we diagnose the control transition to be in a nonequilibrium universality class with dynamical exponent $z&lt;1$ that persists upon reintroducing quantum fluctuations. In the quantum limit, an entanglement transition additionally emerges that coincides with the control transition -- to within our numerical resolution. Both transitions exhibit a dynamical criticality consistent with recent results on measurement-induced phase transitions in power-law interacting circuits. We attribute this feature and the apparent coincidence of the control and entanglement transitions to the global nature of the control.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Green's functions approach for homogeneous nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous nuclear matter is investigated using the \textit{ab initio} Self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) approach with nuclear interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The employed method, which combines the state-of-the-art algebraic diagrammatic construction approximation at third order with Gorkov correlations, is capable of computing both the equation of state (EOS) and single-particle properties of nuclear matter. The EOS calculated with our approach and coupled-cluster theory are shown to agree very well. The one-nucleon spectral functions and the momentum distributions are discussed to gain insights into the dynamics of the interacting nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe 99.1(1.8) % coherence retained under 20 ms exposure, yielding an imaging fidelity of 0.9992 and a survival probability of 0.988. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence, suggesting the potential future improvement of low cross-talk measurements. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Emergent Massive Nambu-Goldstone Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>
