      <title>GEPOC ABM, Generic Population Concept -- Agent-Based Model, Version 2.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generic Population Concept - Agent-Based Model, henceforth short, GEPOC ABM, is one of the models within GEPOC, a generic concept to model a country's population and its dynamics using causal modelling approaches. The model is well established and had already proven its worth in various use cases from evaluation of MMR vaccination rates to SARS-CoV-2 epidemics modelling. In this work we will reproducibly specify the base model, to be specific, version 2.2 of it, and several extensions. The base model GEPOC ABM depicts the population of a country with the features sex and age. It uses a co-simulation-inspired time-update, where person-level discrete-event simulators are synchronised by a simulation layer at macro-steps, making the approach amenable to parallelization. A core design choice is structuring person agents around the life-year rather than the calendar year; accordingly, each agent schedules demographic events annually on their birthday. To expand the model's capabilities beyond basic demographic features, GEPOC ABM Geography adds a residence feature in the form of geographical coordinates. Further extensions include GEPOC ABM IM, which adds internal migration processes in three variants, and GEPOC ABM CL, which models locations where agents may have contacts with each other. In this definition we solely specify the conceptual models and do not go into any details with respect to implementation or gathering/processing of parametrisation data.</description>

      <title>SIR models with demography, random transmission coefficient and non-autonomous vaccination rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of some SIR models incorporating demography, bounded random transmission coefficient and a time-dependent vaccination strategy targeting the susceptible population. In this setting, we establish the existence and uniqueness of non-negative global solution of the models and derive conditions under which either the disease is eradicated or becomes endemic. In addition, the theoretical results are further illustrated by several numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous two-cycles in an integrodifference equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the existence of a 2-cycle in an integrodifference equation with a Laplace kernel and logistic growth function, connecting two non-trivial fixed points of the second iterate of the logistic map in the non-chaotic regime. This model was first studied by Kot (1992), and the 2-cycle we establish corresponds to one numerically observed by Bourgeois, Leblanc, and Lutscher (2018) for the Ricker growth function. We provide strong evidence that the 2-cycle for the Ricker growth function can be rigorously proven using a similar approach. Finally, we present numerical results indicating that both 2-cycles exhibit spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating sampling strategies for effective detection of African swine fever in the growing pig population in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is critical to preventing widespread epidemics. However, the effectiveness of within-farm sampling remains to be examined, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak when disease prevalence is low, animals may be asymptomatic, or clinical signs are masked by co-circulating diseases. This study assessed four sampling strategies for detecting ASFV-infected animals in suspected growing pig farms within the first 14 days of the introduction of either a high- or moderate-virulence ASFV strain. Pens were selected using three methods: random sampling, targeted sampling of pens with clinical animals, and informative sampling based on estimated pen infection probabilities. The informative sampling method was further divided into sequential method, which ranked pens by descending viral load probability, and cluster and random method, which selected pens at random from high and low viral load clusters. Each pen-selection method was examined with different sample sizes. We calculated the sensitivity of each approach as the probability of detecting at least one ASFV-positive pig per farm. Results showed that sampling 30 pens with one pig per pen using the target and random pen-selection method yielded the highest detection sensitivity, even in the presence of other co-circulating diseases that interfere with the accurate identification of clinical ASFV cases. In contrast, sampling five pens resulted in the lowest sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights for improving ASFV surveillance strategies in the U.S. and can inform preparedness efforts for other foreign animal diseases.</description>
