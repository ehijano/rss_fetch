      <title>Burst-mode fs-laser direct writing for full-thickness oxidation of Ta thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct fs-laser (1030~nm/200~fs) write of a throughout oxide Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ on a 200~nm Ta film was achieved using a combined ps- and ns- burst mode (Burst-in-Burst or BiB) of fs-pulse exposure at a high 0.6~MHz repetition rate. Few micrometers-wide lines were formed at the center of 12~$\mu$m focal spot by controlled oxidation without ablation. The oxidized regions were flat and optically transparent. Wavelength-scale self-organized ripples of oxidized Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ sub-1~$\mu$m gratings were recorded by rastering a $1\times 1$~mm$^2$ area. The oxidized ripples with periodic pattern $\sim wavelength$ were aligned with the polarization of the writing beam. Energy deposition in the burst-mode oxidation is discussed by comparing 200~fs and 20~ps BiB-mode writing modes. The presented strategy of self-guided oxidation with heat deposition by BiB fs-laser opens an opportunity for debris-free and annealing-free oxidation on a sub-wavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.</description>
