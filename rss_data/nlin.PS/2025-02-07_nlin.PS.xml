      <title>Numerical Continuation and Bifurcation in Nonlinear PDEs: Stability, invasion and wavetrains in the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of numerical continuation and bifurcation for partial differential equations, specifically pattern formation and coherent structures. For the sake of clarity we focus on wavetrains, stability and associated invasion processes in the paradigmatic cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation (SHE). We do not aim at a review of numerical continuation for PDE or pattern formation in SHE in any generality, rather our goal is to provide an entry point for interested students and colleagues to the application of continuation methods. We provide access to numerical implementations and hope that our presentation provides an introductory guideline that can also be used for teaching.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in the nonreciprocal Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit and the critical behavior of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states are not yet fully understood. To address these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with nonreciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disorder, static order, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, and corresponds to the breaking of a continuous symmetry, time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any finite dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study how the system coarsens into swap and static-order states.</description>
