      <title>Topological domain-wall states from Umklapp scattering in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics, harnessing interlayer rotation to tailor electronic states in van der Waals materials, has predominantly focused on small-angle regime. Here, we unveil the pivotal role of intervalley Umklapp scattering in large-angle twisted bilayer graphene, which governs low-energy physics and drives unconventional band topology. By constructing symmetry-constrained effective $k\cdot p$ models for $\pm 21.8^{\circ}$-twisted bilayers, we demonstrate how structural chirality imprints distinct electronic responses. The $D_6$ configuration exhibits a gapped spectrum with chiral interlayer coupling, while $D_3$ symmetric stacking configuration displays semimetallic behavior. Crucially, chirality inversion creates topological domain-wall states, which manifest as counterpropagating pseudospin modes at interfaces between oppositely twisted regions. These states, absent in untwisted bilayers, emerge from a Jackiw-Rebbi-like mechanism tied to chirality reversal. Atomistic simulations confirm these topological states and demonstrate their robustness against symmetry-breaking perturbations. The interplay between twist-induced chirality and topology opens new pathways for engineering domain-wall states in twisted materials.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid metal-semiconductor quantum dots in InAs as a platform for quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands offer a new approach to quantum simulation, with key advantages over arrays of conventional quantum dots. Because the metallic component of these hybrid islands has a quasi-continuous level spectrum, each site in an array can be effectively electronically identical; in contrast, each conventional semiconductor quantum dot has its own spectral fingerprint. Meanwhile, the semiconductor component retains gate-tunability of intersite coupling. This combination creates a scalable platform for simulating correlated ground states driven by Coulomb interactions. We report the fabrication and characterization of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands, featuring a submicron metallic component transparently contacting a gate-confined region of an InAs quantum well with tunable couplings to macroscopic leads. Tuning to the weak-coupling limit forms a single-electron transistor with highly-uniform Coulomb peaks, with no resolvable excitation spectrum in the Coulomb diamonds. Upon increasing the transmissions toward the ballistic regime we observe an evolution to dynamical Coulomb blockade.</description>

      <title>Transmon qubit using Sn as a junction superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor qubits typically use aluminum-aluminum oxide tunnel junctions to provide the non-linear inductance. Junctions with semiconductor barriers make it possible to vary the superconductor material and explore beyond aluminum. We use InAs semiconductor nanowires coated with thin superconducting shells of beta-Sn to realize transmon qubits. By tuning the Josephson energy with a gate voltage, we adjust the qubit frequency over a range of 3 GHz. The longest energy relaxation time, T1 = 27 microseconds, is obtained at the lowest qubit frequencies, while the longest echo dephasing time, T2 = 1.8 microseconds, is achieved at higher frequencies. We assess the possible factors limiting coherence times in these devices and discuss steps to enhance performance through improvements in materials fabrication and circuit design.</description>

      <title>Straightforward Method to Orient Black Phosphorus from Bulk to Thin Layers using a Standard Green Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallographic orientation of anisotropic 2D materials plays a crucial role in their physical properties and device performance. However, standard orientation techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be complex and less accessible for routine characterization. In this study, we investigate the orientation of black phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a single-wavelength (514 nm) Raman setup. By incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and anisotropic optical indices, this approach provides a reliable framework for orientation determination across different BP thicknesses. The method is validated through direct orientation measurements using TEM and Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick and ultrathin samples. Given its simplicity and compatibility with widely available Raman setups, this approach offers a practical solution for characterizing BP orientation without requiring advanced structural characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Effect of screening on Seebeck coefficient in bilayer graphene/AlGaAs electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of Seebeck coefficient is a key factor in optimization of thermoelectric materials and finding right applications for it. A high sensitivity to structural change makes thermopower measurements an excellent technique for the study on the charge transport properties of a given material. The phonondrag term dominates at low temperature in the Seebeck coefficient This study examines the temperaturedependent screening effect on the phonondraginduced Seebeck coefficient S^g in a bilayer graphene- BLG-AlGaAs-quasi-twodimensional electron gas (q2DEG) system at the temperature below 50 K. The BLG layer interacts with both deformation potential acoustic phonons and stronger piezoelectric field acoustic phonons from AlGaAs/GaAs. We compare the electronphonon interactions in BLG with and without screening by q2DEG. The screening effect reduces particularly at low temperatures and shows a strong dependence on the carrier density in the BLG layer. The doublelayer screening function increases with layer separation d paralleling the monolayer screening at large d. Additionally varying the GaAs quantum well width reveals that increases with width less than 100 \AA under doublelayer screening but remains unchanged beyond this threshold while monolayer screening decreases as the width increases. Both screening functions enhance when the BLG carrier density is lower than that of q2DEG though the magnitude difference between them is minimal</description>

      <title>Inelastic electron tunneling through adatoms and molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a theoretical description of the inelastic electron tunneling spectra (IETS) of a magnetic nanosystem (an atom or a molecule) adsorbed on a solid surface measured in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We represent the nanosystem by means of a cluster Hubbard model, which allows us to study scenarios when the tunneling electrons sequentially interact with several magnetic centers inside the nanosystem or when the magnetic centers are made out of heavy atoms with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large orbital moments. The sequential tunneling through multiple centers is illustrated on an adatom probed by an STM tip with a nickelocene molecule attached to it. For atoms with a large orbital moment, we find the transitions accessible by IETS to be governed by the selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 2\ell+1$, where $J_z$ is the projection of the total angular momentum of the atom to the quantization axis and $\ell$ is the orbital momentum quantum number of the partially filled atomic shell carrying the magnetic moment. For atoms with magnetic moments dominated by spin, the spectra are naturally dominated by transitions fulfilling the traditional selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Structural and helix reversal defects of carbon nanosprings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their chiral structure, carbon nanosprings possess unique properties that are promising for nanotechnology applications. The structural transformations of carbon nanosprings in the form of spiral macromolecules derived from planar coronene and kekulene molecules (graphene helicoids and spiral nanoribbons) are analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. While the tension/compression of such nanosprings has been analyzed in the literature, this study investigates other modes of deformation, including bending and twisting. Depending on the geometric characteristics of the carbon nanosprings, the formation of structural and helix reversal defects is described. It is found that nanosprings demonstrate a significantly higher coefficient of axial thermal expansion than many metals and alloys. These results are useful for designing nanosensors that operate over a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Density of States (Gate) - Controlled Andreev Molecule and Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing typically relies on topological Andreev bound states (ABSs) engineered in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, where gate control offers key advantages. While strong Zeeman fields can induce such states, an alternative approach emerges through Andreev molecules -- closely spaced, coupled ABSs, also key building-block for Kitaev chain -- that enable topological behavior without high magnetic fields. However, existing Andreev molecules are controlled via magnetic flux in superconducting loops, limiting scalability. Here, we introduce a gate-controlled Andreev molecule, where electrostatic tuning of the density of states in one site nonlocally enhances the critical current of another. This eliminates superconducting loops, offering superior tunability, scalability, and sensitivity. We further extend such an Andreev molecule to a multi-site Kitaev chain, and a noninvasive sensor resolving single-Cooper-pair charge for parity readout. This platform bridges the gap between scalable ABS engineering and high-sensitivity quantum sensing, advancing the development for constructing and parity-readout in topological ABSs and long Kitaev chains towards topological qubits.</description>

      <title>Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged CF Hilbert space, with the well-known trace condition emerging naturally in the small-$q$ limit. Applied to twisted MoTe$_2$, the calculated CF phase diagram matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter. Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>

Abstract: Photonics, dealing with the generation, manipulation, and detection of photons in various systems, lays the foundation of many advanced technologies. A key task of photonics is to know how photons propagate in complex media such as periodic and aperiodic photonic crystals. The conventional wisdom is to numerically solve the Maxwell equations either by dedicated numerical techniques or brute-force finite-element calculations. Recently, the strict analogy between photonic crystals and theoretical tight-binding models provides an unprecedentedly convenient wayof understanding the spectra and wavefunctions of photonic systems by mapping the complicated differential equationsinto matrixed Hamiltonians that can be easily solved through the band theory and exact diagonalization. in this paper, we present a timely review of tight-binding-like photonics in various platforms, covering fundamental theories, experimental realizations, unique physical efiects, and their potential applications. We also provide a brief outlook on the future trends of this active area. Our review offers an in-depth and comprehensive picture on this rapidly developing field and may shed light on the future design on advanced tight-binding-like photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Growth of few-layer molecular crystals of PTCDI on hexagonal boron nitride by microspacing air-gap sublimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended two-dimensional (2D) crystals of dye molecules adsorbed on 2D material substrates like boron nitride have recently become a subject of intense study, with potential applications ranging from quantum technology to optoelectronics. The most established technique for the production of these films is physical vapor transport in vacuum. We demonstrate that few-layer crystalline films of the organic dye molecule PTCDI on boron nitride can be produced by microspacing in-air sublimation, a radically simplified technique, not requiring complicated vacuum systems. The resulting layers display clearly resolved atomic step terraces in atomic force microscopy, and a clear polarization anisotropy in their fluorescence, confirming molecular alignment and long-range order. Using density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics simulations, the canted motive is identified as the most likely building block for the morphology of a PTDCI monolayer on the hBN substrate.</description>

      <title>A colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the dielectric permittivity is explained by the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations, which reveal that small HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles can become ferroelectric in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible ferroelectric nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Undulation-induced moir\'e superlattices with 1D polarization domains and 1D flat bands in 2D bilayer semiconductors</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a high F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an number and can be easily bent, much like a paper, making undulations a novel way to design distinct electronic phases. Through first-principles calculations, we reveal the formation of 1D polarization domains and 1D flat electronic bands by 1D bending modulation to a 2D bilayer semiconductor. Using 1D sinusoidal undulation of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer as an example, we demonstrate how undulation induces nonuniform shear patterns, creating regions with unique local stacking and vertical polarization akin to sliding-induced ferroelectrics observed in twisted moir\'e systems. This sliding-induced polarization is also observed in double-wall BN nanotubes due to curvature differences between inner and outer tubes. Furthermore, undulation generates a shear-induced 1D moir\'e pattern that perturbs electronic states, confining them into 1D quantum-well-like bands with kinetic energy quenched in modulation direction while dispersive in other directions (1D flat bands). This electronic confinement is attributed to modulated shear deformation potential resulting from tangential polarization due to the moir\'e pattern. Thus, bending modulation and interlayer shear offer an alternative avenue, termed "curvytronics", to induce exotic phenomena in 2D bilayer materials.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>

Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>

      <title>Plasmons in N-layer systems</title>

Abstract: In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szeg\H{o} Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Fingerprinting of Bloch- and N\'{e}el-type Skyrmions</title>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability in the nematic phase of two monolayer FeSe/SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nematicity, where electrons break rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry, is ubiquitous in strongly correlated quantum matters, including high-Tc cuprates and iron-based superconductors. A central question in nematicity is whether it is driven by Pomeranchuk instability in momentum space or orbital order (polarization) in real space, especially as nematicity intertwines with superconductivity. FeSe/SrTiO3 (STO), where nematicity occurs without long-range magnetic order, is an ideal platform for studying the nature and origin of the electronic nematicity. Here we present direct evidence of Pomeranchuk nematic order in two monolayer FeSe/STO using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable degeneracy of dxz and dyz bands at the Brillouin zone center, but a significant band separation at the zone corner. This momentum-dependent nematicity demonstrates that nematicity in FeSe/STO originates from the Pomeranchuk instability, offering insights into the relationship between nematicity and superconductivity. Our results establish two-dimensional FeSe thin film as a powerful platform for investigating quantum physics under complex intertwinement.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>
