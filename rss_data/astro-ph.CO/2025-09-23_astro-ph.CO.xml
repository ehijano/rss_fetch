      <title>CLASH-VLT: Constraining deviation from GR with the mass profiles of nine massive galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^itre Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.</description>

      <title>The Noise of Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of primordial cosmological perturbations in a vacuum decay model where de Sitter space transitions to radiation domination through quantum-thermal decay processes. Unlike standard inflation, this framework generates curvature perturbations through stochastic noise from vacuum decay rather than quantum fluctuations of an inflaton field. We derive the stochastic differential equation governing the curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}(t)$ and show that any horizon crossing is brief and does not constitute the primary mechanism for perturbation generation. Scale dependence emerges from spatial correlations in the noise rather than horizon crossing dynamics. The model naturally addresses the horizon and flatness problems through initial thermal equilibrium in de Sitter space and predicts zero tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that spatially correlated noise can generate observationally viable spectral tilts while maintaining Gaussian statistics.</description>

      <title>Overdispersed radio source counts and excess radio dipole detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source count dipole from wide-area radio continuum surveys allows us to test the cosmological standard model. Many radio sources have multiple components, which can cause an overdispersion of the source counts distribution. We account for this effect via a new Bayesian estimator, based on the negative binomial distribution. Combining the two best understood wide-area surveys, NVSS and RACS-low, and the deepest wide-area survey, LoTSS-DR2, we find that the source count dipole exceeds its expected value as the kinematic dipole amplitude from standard cosmology by a factor of $3.67 \pm 0.49$ -- a $5.4\sigma$ discrepancy.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension resolved by the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Cosmological Constraints on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Challenges of standard halo models in constraining galaxy properties from CIB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo model, combined with halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions, is widely used to interpret cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies and connect star-forming galaxies to large-scale structure. Recent implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency, $\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\rm max}$, when fitted to mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions (the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation (SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\rm max}$, even when applied to data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD, emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\sim 50\%$) but only modestly ($&lt;10\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on Galileon dark energy with broken shift symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Tracing the high-z cosmic web with Quaia: catalogues of voids and clusters in the quasar distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies is a fundamental goal of cosmology, using various tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure at an ever wider range of redshifts. Our principal aim is to advance the mapping of the cosmic web at high redshifts using observational and synthetic catalogues of quasars (QSOs), which offer a powerful probe of structure formation and the validity of the concordance cosmological model. In this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ from the Quaia data set, allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues, including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at $100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and density profiles. In particular, we tested the role of survey mask proximity effects in the void and cluster detection, which albeit present, are consistent in simulations and observations. The largest voids and clusters reach $R_{eff} \approx 250 h^{-1}$Mpc and $150 h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively, but without evidence for ultra-large cosmic structures exceeding the dimensions of the largest structures in the mocks. As an important deliverable, we share our density field estimation, void catalogues, and cluster catalogues with the public, allowing various additional cross-correlation probes at high-z.</description>

      <title>The origin of the intra-cluster light in The Three Hundred simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the origin and formation mechanisms of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba, we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place between $z \sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall) masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters. Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion (20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \leq 1$, with smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside). Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and 2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inventory of the background fields of relativistic particles in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background.
  In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry IV: Spectroscopic Confirmation of DESI Lens Candidates with VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integral field spectroscopic observations of 75 strong gravitational lens candidates identified with a residual neural network in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO's Very Large Telescope. These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.</description>

Abstract: We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry II: DESI Spectroscopy for Strong Lens Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.</description>

      <title>Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.</description>

      <title>Light thermal dark matter models in the light of DAMIC-M 2025 constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.</description>

      <title>Reverberation lags viewed in hard X-rays from an accreting stellar-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new type of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives of all the fields in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The higher derivative vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar-Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. We also present a subclass of these SVT theories with 8 free functions of $\pi$ and $X$ where the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. In particular, the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the vector modes tracks the speed of the tensor modes. Additionally, the vector sector retains freedom through the four new functions. All the theories here shown are a generalization of the Kaluza-Klein reduction of 5D Horndeski theory, sharing the main properties in cosmology, but including new free scalar functions in the Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying perspective on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $&lt; 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $&lt; 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $&gt; 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of accretion onto supermassive black holes on the density profiles of a fuzzy dark matter soliton core at the center of a dark matter halo. Treating the supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy as a point mass, we numerically solve the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation for the scalar field. We find that the time-dependent perturbation has a significant squeezing effect on the soliton density profile, which both reduces the size of the core and increases the central density. This finding provides insights into how black hole growth influences fuzzy dark matter structures, potentially addressing discrepancies in galactic core observations.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of the thermal dust $E/B$ ratio and $EB$ correlation: insights from the spin-moment expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The change of physical conditions across the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) induces a 3D spatial variation of the properties of Galactic polarized emission. The observed signal results from the averaging of different spectral energy distributions (SED) and polarization angles, along and between lines of sight. As a consequence, the total Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ will have different distorted SEDs, so that the polarization angle becomes frequency dependent. In the present work, we show how this phenomenon similarly induces a different distorted SED for the three polarized angular power spectra $EE$, $BB$ and $EB$, implying a variation of the $EE/BB$ ratio with frequency. We demonstrate how the previously introduced spin-moment formalism provides a natural framework to grasp these effects, allowing us to derive analytical predictions for the spectral behaviors of the polarized spectra, focusing here on the example of thermal dust polarized emission. After a quantitative discussion based on a model combining emission from a filament with its background, we further reveal that the spectral complexity implemented in the dust models commonly used by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) community produce such effects. This new understanding is crucial for CMB component separation, in which an extreme accuracy is required in the modeling of the dust signal to allow for the search of the primordial imprints of inflation or cosmic birefringence. For the latter, as long as the dust $EB$ signal is not measured accurately, great caution is required about the assumptions made to model its spectral behavior, as it may not simply follow from the other dust angular power spectra.</description>

      <title>How bad could it be? Modelling the 3D complexity of the polarised dust signal using moment expansion</title>

Abstract: The variation of the physical conditions across the three dimensions of our Galaxy is a major source of complexity for the modelling of the foreground signal facing the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the present work, we demonstrate that the spin-moment expansion formalism provides a powerful framework to model and understand this complexity, with a special focus on that arising from variations of the physical conditions along each line-of-sight on the sky. We perform the first application of the moment expansion to reproduce a thermal dust model largely used by the CMB community, demonstrating its power as a minimal tool to compress, understand and model the information contained within any foreground model. Furthermore, we use this framework to produce new models of thermal dust emission containing the maximal amount of complexity allowed by the current data, remaining compatible with the observed angular power-spectra by the $Planck$ mission. By assessing the impact of these models on the performance of component separation methodologies, we conclude that the additional complexity contained within the third dimension could represent a significant challenge for future CMB experiments and that different component separation approaches are sensitive to different properties of the moments.</description>

      <title>A New Census of the Universe's Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Fresh Look at Neutrino Self-Interactions With the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest: Constraints from EFT and PRIYA Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first search for evidence of neutrino self-interaction with two new, state-of-the-art likelihoods for eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ data. These are an effective field theory (EFT) likelihood with priors from the Sherwood simulation suite, and a compressed likelihood derived from an emulator built using the PRIYA simulation suite. Previous analyses that combined Planck measurements with eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ likelihoods based on earlier simulations found a preference for neutrino self-interactions. In contrast, using either of the new eBOSS Lyman-$\alpha$ likelihoods, we find that a joint analysis with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck prefers a negligible level of neutrino self-interaction, and derive new constraints on the neutrino self-coupling: $\mathrm{log}_{10}(G_\mathrm{eff} \ \mathrm{MeV}^2)=-5.57_{-0.58}^{+0.98}$ for Planck + EFT Lyman-$\alpha$, and $\mathrm{log}_{10}(G_\mathrm{eff} \ \mathrm{MeV}^2)=-5.16_{-0.67}^{+1.12}$ for Planck + PRIYA Lyman-$\alpha$, at 68% confidence. We also consider Planck in combination with DESI BAO data, and find that the latter does not provide significant constraining power for neutrino self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Refined Predictions for Starobinsky Inflation and Post-inflationary Constraints in Light of ACT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\star \gtrsim 58$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\omega \gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\omega \simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{10}~\text{GeV}$, assuming $\omega \leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\sigma$ of the recent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\text{MeV} \lesssim T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 10~\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \lesssim \omega \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of Stage-III cosmic shear surveys: A comprehensive study of shear diagnostic tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. These shear catalogs have undergone rigorous validation tests to ensure that the residual shear systematic effects in the catalogs are subdominant relative to the statistical uncertainties, such that the resulting cosmological constraints are unbiased. While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs -- the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails with a $\chi^2$/dof of 121.1/16 and 257.7/16 for bins 4 and 5 for faint, weighted stars. We also find that DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 fail the $B$-mode test when estimated with the Hybrid-$E$/$B$ method, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 37.9/10 and 36.0/8 for the fourth and third autocorrelation bins. We assess the impacts on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination -- we find negligible effects in all cases. Finally, we propose strategies for performing these tests on future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>New Expansion Rate Anomalies at Characteristic Redshifts Geometrically Determined using DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the cosmic distances using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework as well as knot-based spline techniques with DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed cosmic distances and their derivatives, we obtain seven characteristic redshifts in the range $0.3 \leq z \leq 1.7$. We derive the normalized expansion rate of the Universe $E(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal significant deviations of approximately $4$ to $5\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time tensions in the expansion rate of the Universe and which are distinct from the existing "Hubble Tension". This could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework at this redshift range. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and will confirm whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.</description>

      <title>Testing Cosmic Distance Duality Relation and Transparency with DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) is a basic relation of standard cosmology. This work tests the CDDR and cosmic transparency using angular diameter distances from DESI DR2, luminosity distances from Pantheon+, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter. First, we use two redshift matching reconstruction method, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Control Points Interpolating (CPI) finding that the results are highly dependent on the cosmological prior choose which relates to Hubble tension. We then estimate parameters for several phenomenological models, comparing reconstruction methods and the effect of marginalization. The results show that marginalization has no significant impact, but the choice of reconstruction method is highly influential, highlighting methodology as a primary source of systematic uncertainty. Furthermore, our test for cosmic opacity rules out cosmic dust and provides auxiliary support for the validity of the CDDR. Therefore, we conclude that the CDDR itself exhibits no significant deviation, but different redshift matching methods strongly affect the results, and some singular results are more likely attributed to supernova calibration.</description>

      <title>Blending effects on shear measurement synergy between Euclid-like and LSST-like surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe for constraining cosmological parameters, but its success relies on accurate shear measurements. In this paper, we use image simulations to investigate how a joint analysis of high-resolution space-based and deep ground-based imaging can improve shear estimation. We simulate two scenarios: a grid-based setup, where galaxies are placed on a regular grid to mimic an idealised, blending-free scenario, and a random setup, where galaxies are randomly distributed to capture the impact of blending. Comparing these cases, we find that blending introduces significant biases, particularly in LSST-like data due to its larger point spread function. This highlights the importance of including realistic blending effects when evaluating the performance of joint analyses. Using simulations that account for blending, we find that the most effective catalogue-level synergy is achieved by combining all galaxies detected in either survey. This approach yields an effective galaxy number density of $44.08~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ over the magnitude range of 20.0 to 27.5, compared to $39.17~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for LSST-like data alone and $30.31~\rm arcmin^{-2}$ for \textit{Euclid}-like data alone. Restricting the analysis to only the overlapping sources detected in both surveys results in a gain of ${\sim}12\%$ compared to using either survey alone. While this joint-object approach is suboptimal at the catalogue level, it may become more effective in pixel-level analyses, where a joint fit to individual galaxy shapes can better leverage the complementary strengths of both data sets. Studying such pixel-level combinations, with realistic blending effects properly accounted for, remains a promising direction for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a torsion-based cosmological model within the Einstei-Cartan framework, constrained by the latest combined datasets including DESI DR2 BAO, PantheonPlus and DESY5 supernovae, and the full Planck 2018 CMB measurements (temperature, polarization, and joint NPIPE PR4 + ACT DR6 lensing). The torsion parameter is constrained to $\alpha = -0.00066 \pm 0.00098$ with the full dataset combination, consistent with zero at less than $1\sigma$, while yielding a Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.41 \pm 0.32$ km/s/Mpc and matter clustering amplitude $S_8 = 0.812 \pm 0.006$. The model shows notable potential in alleviating cosmological tensions, reducing the $S_8$ discrepancy with KiDS-1000 from $\sim 2.3\sigma$ in $\Lambda$CDM to only $0.1\sigma$. Model comparisons based on the Akaike information criterion show consistent improvements across all datasets, with $\Delta {\rm AIC}$ values ranging from $-5.68$ to $-6.62$, indicating a statistically preferred fit for the torsion model. These results suggest that the torsion framework provides a physically well-motivated extension to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of simultaneously addressing key cosmological tensions while maintaining excellent agreement with diverse observational probes.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Universes in Light of Background Cosmological Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where the degree of anisotropy is quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that $\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim 10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework. These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic cosmologies to better understand their implications.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes versus their impersonators at gravitational wave observatories</title>

Abstract: The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.</description>

Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>

      <title>The Altered Chaplygin Model as a Model for Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM-like evolution in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory of gravity in a cosmological context using the formalism of dynamical systems. We obtain the equations of motion of the theory and introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to allow for a direct comparison with the results from General Relativity (GR). We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90 GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z=0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5\pm0.6\times10^{15}$ M$_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large-scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method to model the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24\pm4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and is spatially closely correlated with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. We characterize a potential shock candidate at the cluster center, based on the sharp temperature and pressure gradient, and quantify its temperature-derived Mach number in various directions to span a range of $M = (1.7 - 2.0) \pm 0.3$. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $3.1_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ keV and a density $(3.78\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim400$ relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim6.1\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim(6.8\pm2.7)\times10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. II. Comparison of galaxy properties and fundamental relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types were assigned using both parametric and nonparametric methods, while physical properties were derived through SED fitting. Galaxies were further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third- and fourth-order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in the sSFRs of low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the connection between galactic conformity and assembly-type bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies in the Universe show a conformity in the fraction of quenched galaxies out to large distances, being much larger around quenched central galaxies than for star-forming ones. On the other hand, simulations have shown that the clustering of halos and the galaxies within them depends on secondary properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon termed assembly bias. Aims. Our aim is to study whether samples that show galactic conformity also show assembly bias and to see if the amplitude of these two effects is correlated. Methods. We use synthetic galaxies at $z = 0$ from the semi-analytical model SAG run on the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) cosmological simulation and measure both conformity and galaxy assembly bias for different samples of central galaxies at fixed host halo mass. We focus on central galaxies hosted by low-mass halos of 10$^{11.6}$ $\leq$ $M_{\rm h}$/$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{11.8}$ because it is a mass range where the assembly bias has been reported to be strong. The samples of central galaxies are separated according to their specific star formation rate and stellar age. Results. We find that the level of conformity shown by our different samples is correlated with the level of assembly bias measured for them. We also find that removing central galaxies around massive halos diminishes the conformity signal and lowers the amount of assembly bias. Conclusions. The high correlation in the amplitude of conformity and assembly bias for different samples with and without removing galaxies near massive halos clearly indicates the strong relationship between both phenomena.</description>

      <title>Full-Spectrum Analysis of Gravitational Wave Production from Inflation to Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study gravitational wave (GW) production during both the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. While inflationary GWs can be readily derived from tensor perturbations during inflation, post-inflationary GWs arise from a variety of processes during reheating and require detailed treatment for quantitative analysis. We consider four distinct production channels: $(i)$ pure inflaton annihilation, $(ii)$ graviton bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $(iii)$ radiation-catalyzed inflaton-graviton conversion, and $(iv)$ scattering among fully thermalized radiation particles. For each channel, we solve the corresponding Boltzmann equation to obtain the GW spectrum and derive a simple yet accurate analytical expression for it. By employing a consistent treatment of all production channels, our analysis yields for the first time the full spectrum of GWs produced during the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. We find that, while inflationary GWs dominate at low frequencies, post-inflationary processes generally produce high-frequency GWs with considerably high energy densities that may significantly exceed that of inflationary GWs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from $F(R)$ Gravity Models Unifying Inflation with Dark Energy: Confronting the Latest Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.</description>

      <title>A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass-loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to follow the trajectory of $\sim$18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E &lt; -0.7 |E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})|$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E &gt; -0.7 |E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})|$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is an upcoming Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Confronting Rainbow-deformed $f(R)$ Gravity with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.</description>

      <title>Unique gravitational wave signatures of GLPV scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Power-law $F(R)$ Gravity as Deformations to Starobinsky Inflation in View of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we aim to provide a new parametrization of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame. It is known in the literature that the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation of the form $F(R)=R+\beta R^n$ is non-viable and produces a power-law evolution. We demonstrate that the standard approach in power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation has some parametrization issues that may lead to inconsistencies and we introduce a new parametrization which elevates the role of power-law $F(R)$ gravity deformations of the Starobinsky inflation, making it viable and compatible with both the Planck and ACT data. In our approach the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is disentangled from a power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</description>
