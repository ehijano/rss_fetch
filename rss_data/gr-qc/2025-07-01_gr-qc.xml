      <title>Quantum Uncertainties of Static Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a canonical quantization framework for static spherically symmetric spacetimes described by the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In addition to recovering the classical Schwarzschild-(Anti)-de Sitter solutions via the Ehrenfest theorem, we investigate the quantum uncertainty relations that arise among the geometric operators in this setup. Our analysis uncovers an intriguing relation to black hole thermodynamics and opens a new angle towards generalized uncertainty relations. We further obtain an upper and a lower limit of the mass that is allowed in our model, for a given value of the cosmological constant. Both limits, when evaluated for the known value of the cosmological constant, have a stunning relation to observed bounds. These findings open a promising avenue for deeper insights into how quantum effects manifest in spacetime geometry and gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| &lt; (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| &lt; (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Shadow and thin accretion disk around Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole coupled with cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadow and thin accretion disk around Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS), characterized by the nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) parameter $g$, and the CS parameter $a$. By comparing shadow diameters with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^*$, we have established constraints on the BH parameters $g$ and $a$. Additionally, we analyze the BH shadow, lensing ring, and photon ring features for the ABG BH coupled with CS. Our results indicate that the shadow radius increases monotonically with the CS parameter $a$, while it decreases with increasing $g$. Finally, the study explores the physical properties and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around ABG BH with CS. The results show that an increase in parameter $g$ leads to a hotter and more luminous disk, while an increase in parameter $a$ results in a cooler and less luminous disk.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous genesis of naked singularities through quantum-gravitational processes: conclusive evidence for violation of cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic censorship conjecture takes a pivotal status in general relativity. We demonstrate that quantum effects, Hawking effect together with Shwinger effect inevitably lead to violation of cosmic censorship. We find that naked singularity spontaneously appears in late time evolution of an isolated large dilatonic black hole. The critical discovery is that the power of Hawking radiation converges to a finite value for an extreme dilatonic black hole, which directly exposes the singularity in finite time. The spectrum of Hawking radiation of extreme dilatonic black holes becomes a truncated shrink Planck distribution. We analyze the underlying physics of the spectrum of Hawking radiation, which roots in extraordinarily wide potential around the horizon. We study the discharge mechanism of a dilatonic black hole through Schwinger effect. Amazingly, the Schwinger pair production naturally ceases for an extreme dilatonic black hole with mass larger than $1.7\times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, we show that evaporation of charged particle because of the Schwinger effect do not save the cosmic censorship for black holes heavier than $1.784\times 10^7 $ solar masses in a significant region of initial charge parameter space. For the first time, we demonstrate that the naked singularities are {\rm spontaneously} formed driven by quantum effects, such that we learn quantum gravity directly from the information shedded from the singularity.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. Subsequently, we analyze their differences in photon orbit distributions, transfer functions, and received intensities. Our results reveal distinct inclination-dependent behaviors between the two semi-disks: when the inclination approaches $\pi/2$, the co-side semi-disk develops richer ring structures with the lensed emission dominating the total brightness. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.</description>

      <title>Statistic threshold of distinguishing the environmental effects and modified theory of gravity with multiple massive black-hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future space-borne \ac{GW} observations, matter arround the sources might influence the evolution and \ac{GW} signals from \ac{BBH} inspirals, which can be mistaken as deviations from \ac{GR}. Former research \cite{yuan2024} proposed a statistic $F$ that characterizes the dispersion of measured parameters to distinguish environmental effect(\ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike) and theory of modified gravity effect(varying $G$). In this work we use the statistic to distinguish other couples of effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike and the extra dimension theory, additionally try to determine the distinguishing threshold in more reasonable way to avoid arbitrariness, especially when the two effects to compare have more overlap in the $F$ distribution. Sources of different astronomical models are also considered, and two effects are still distinguishable but not much as in former work\cite{yuan2024}, so the threshold should be carefully selected. Following these procedures, we finally obtain the statistic thresholds of distinguishment between the three effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike, the extra dimension theory, and varying $G$ theory. The method can be used to distinguish other effects among environmental effects and modified theories of gravity effects with the detections of \ac{GW} events.</description>

      <title>Influence of external magnetic fields on charged particle motion around a Schwarzschild-like black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged and neutral particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in an external magnetic field. We find that the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for charged particles are systematically smaller than those of neutral particles, demonstrating a fundamental distinction in their orbital dynamics. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, charged particle ISCOs can approach arbitrarily close to the event horizon. We show that collisions between charged particles in ISCOs and neutral particles falling from infinity can produce unbounded center-of-mass energies in the strong-field regime, suggesting the black hole magnetosphere as a natural particle accelerator. Additionally, we apply the relativistic precession model to study quasi-periodic oscillations around the Schwarzschild-like black hole, treating orbital perturbations as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our results provide new insights into high-energy astrophysical processes near magnetized black holes and offer observational signatures through quasi-periodic oscillating frequencies that could be detected by current and future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic excitation of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.</description>

      <title>Measurements in stochastic gravity and thermal variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a free, conformally invariant, Maxwell quantum field (photon) interacting with a cosmological background spacetime, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and semiclassical and stochastic gravity. The thermal fluctuations give rise to backreaction effects upon the spacetime geometry, which are incorporated in the semiclassical Einstein-Langevin equation, evaluated in the cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We first evaluate the semiclassical Einstein equation for the background geometry sourced by the thermal quantum stress-energy tensor. For large enough temperature, the solution is approximated by a radiation-dominated expanding universe driven by the thermal bath of photons. We then evaluate the thermal noise kernel associated to the quantum fluctuations of the photon field using point-splitting regularization methods, and give its explicit analytic form in the limits of large and small temperature, as well as a local approximation. Finally, we prove that this thermal noise kernel corresponds exactly to the thermal variance of the induced fluctuations of the linearized metric perturbation in the local and covariant measurement scheme defined by Fewster and Verch. Our analysis allows to quantify the extent to which quantum fluctuations may give rise to non-classical effects, and thus become relevant in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Helically twisted spacetime: study of geometric and wave optics, and physical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a stationary, cylindrically symmetric spacetime endowed with an intrinsic helical twist, $ds^{2} = -dt^{2} + dr^{2} + r^{2} d\phi^{2} + (dz + \omega\, r\,d\phi)^{2}$. Solving the Einstein equations exactly yields an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor whose density is negative and decays as $r^{-2}$, thus violating the weak energy condition near the axis. Three notable features emerge: (i) axis-centred negative energy; (ii) unequal transverse stresses; (iii) a torsional momentum flux $T_{\phi z}\omega^{3}/r$. We identify stable photon orbits and deflection angle, fully helical geodesics, and torsion-controlled wave optics modes, suggesting laboratory analogues in twisted liquid-crystal and photonic systems. The coupling between the torsion parameter $\omega$ and other physical parameters leads to significant effects, altering the motion along the positive or negative $z$-axis. These results make the twisted helical metric a useful test bed for studying the interplay of curvature, torsion, and matter in both gravitational and condensed-matter contexts.</description>

      <title>From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Curvature and Topological Insights of Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the influence of string fluids on the extended thermodynamic structure and microscopic interactions of Hayward black holes by employing thermodynamic geometry as an empirical tool. Using the novel equation of state obtained for regular black holes surrounded by string fluids, we analyze the extended phase space with enthalpy as the central thermodynamic potential. By examining the behavior of the normalized Ruppeiner curvature scalar $R_N$ in the temperature-volume $(T,V)$ plane, we analyzed the influence of the string fluid parameters on the microstructure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the presence of string fluids significantly modifies the dominant microscopic interactions, transitioning from attractive to repulsive regimes depending on the charge and volume of the black hole. We see that the thermodynamic curvature effectively detects critical points and phase transitions, reflecting the nature of repulsive or attractive interactions among black hole microstructures. We further investigate thermodynamic topology to provide a novel classification scheme for stability and phase behavior, delineating local stable and unstable regions in parameter space. We investigate the thermodynamic topology of Hayward-AdS black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing that the number and type of topological charges depend on the parameters $\epsilon$ and $b$, revealing phase transitions and stability characteristics encoded in the global topological charge $W$. This integrated study of the thermodynamic geometry and topology structure enhances the understanding of Hayward black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing overall thermodynamic stability and configuration with significant implications for holographic duality and potential astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological solutions from 5D $N=4$ matter-coupled supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11905v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From five-dimensional $N=4$ matter-coupled gauged supergravity, smooth time-dependent cosmological solutions, connecting a $dS_{5-d}\times H^d$ (with $d=2,3$) spacetime at early times to a $dS_5$ spacetime at late times, are presented. The solutions are derived from the second-order equations of motion arising from all the gauged theories that can admit $dS_5$ solutions. There are eight such theories constructed from gauge groups of the form $SO(1,1)\times G_{nc}$ and $SO(1,1)^{(n)}_\text{diag}\times G_{nc}$, with $n=2,3$, where $G_{nc}$ is a non-compact gauge factor whose compact part must be embedded entirely in the matter symmetry group of 5D matter-coupled supergravity. Furthermore, we analyze how the cosmological solutions and their corresponding $dS_5$ vacua cannot arise from the first-order equations that solve the second-order field equations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive numerical study on four categories of holographic dark energy models</title>

Abstract: Holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a theoretical attempt to apply the holographic principle (HP) to the dark energy (DE) problem, has attracted significant attention over the past two decades. We perform a comprehensive numerical study on HDE models that can be classified into four categories: 1) HDE models with other characteristic length scale, 2) HDE models with extended Hubble scale, 3) HDE models with dark sector interaction, 4) HDE models with modified black hole entropy. For theoretical models, we select seven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE (RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and IHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model. For cosmological data, we use the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors data from the Planck 2018, and the type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the PantheonPlus compilation. Using $\chi^2$ statistic and Bayesian evidence, we compare these HDE models with current observational data. It is found that: 1) The $\Lambda$CDM remains the most competitive model, while the RDE model is ruled out. 2) HDE models with dark sector interaction perform the worst across the four categories, indicating that the interaction term is not favored under the framework of HDE. 3) The other three categories show comparable performance. The OHDE model performs better in the BAO+CMB dataset, and the HDE models with modified black hole entropy perform better in the BAO+CMB+SN dataset. 4) HDE models with the future event horizon exhibit significant discrepancies in parameter space across datasets. The BAO+CMB dataset favors a phantom-like HDE, whereas the BAO+CMB+SN leads to an equation of state (EoS) much closer to the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Exploring the parameter space of hierarchical triple black hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40{\deg}-80{\deg}). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based population inference of LISA's Galactic binaries: Bypassing the global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Neutron Star Merger Ejecta and Remnants with Gravitational Wave and Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <title>A unified origin for dark energy and resonant dark matter from strongly-coupled gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a unified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of dark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale. Building on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves cosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we show that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors predicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the required anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.50\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy mechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a TeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\chi \approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar meson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\Phi_h}/m_\chi \approx 2$ naturally emerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This resonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to be a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the long-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving small-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\sim 1.2$~TeV accessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\sigma_T/m \sim 1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy and dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how 95\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying strongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework for dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.</description>

      <title>Effects of Large Optical Depth on CD HI 21-cm Non-Gaussian Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the Cosmic Dawn (CD), the HI 21-cm optical depth ($\tau$ ) in the intergalactic medium can become significantly large. Consequently, the second and higher-order terms of $\tau$ appearing in the Taylor expansion of the HI 21-cm differential brightness temperature ($\delta T_{\rm b}$ ) become important. This introduces additional non-Gaussianity into the signal. We study the impact of large $\tau$ on statistical quantities of HI 21-cm signal using a suite of standard numerical simulations that vary X-ray heating efficiency and the minimum halo mass required to host radiation sources. We find that the higher order terms suppress statistical quantities such as skewness, power-spectrum and bispectrum. However, the effect is found to be particularly strong on the non-Gaussian signal. We find that the change in skewness can reach several hundred percent in low X-ray heating scenarios. For moderate and high X-ray heating models changes are around $\sim40\%$ and $60\%$, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{9}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. This change is around $\sim 75\%$, $25\%$ and $20\%$ for low, moderate and high X-ray heating models, respectively, for $M_{\rm h,min}=10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$. The change in bispectrum in both the halo cutoff mass scenarios ranges from $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 300\%$ for low X-ray heating model. However, for moderate and high X-ray heating models the change remains between $\sim 10\%$ to $\sim 200\%$ for both equilateral and squeezed limit triangle configuration. Finally, we find that up to third orders of $\tau$ need to be retained to accurately model $\delta T_{\rm b}$, especially for capturing the non-Gaussian features in the HI 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.</description>

      <title>ACT DR6 Leads to Stronger Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is fundamental to the composition, structure, and evolution of the universe. Combining the ACT's cosmic microwave background, DESI's baryon acoustic oscillations with DESY5 type Ia supernova observations, we find a $3.4\,\sigma$ evidence for dynamical dark matter (DDM) with an equation of state, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Independent of the Planck measurements, the ACT data confirms the linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing that the equation of state of dark matter is directly proportional to the scale factor $a$. Furthermore, the effects of DDM on the large-scale structure observables are thoroughly studied. Our findings are of great significance for understanding cosmic acceleration, structure growth, and the fate of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LISA, are expected to detect thousands of Galactic close white dwarf binaries emitting nearly monochromatic GWs. In this study, we demonstrate that LISA is reasonably likely to detect higher harmonic GW signals, particularly the $(l, |m|) = (3, 3)$ mode, from a limited sample of nearby close white dwarf binaries, even with small orbital velocities $v/c$ of order $10^{-3}$. The amplitudes of these post-Newtonian modes provide robust probes of mass asymmetry in such systems, making them valuable observational targets, especially in mass-transferring binaries. Long-term, coordinated detector operations will further improve the prospects for detecting these informative signals.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>Relational entanglement entropies and quantum reference frames in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that defining gravitational entanglement entropies relative to quantum reference frames (QRFs) intrinsically regularizes them. Here, we demonstrate that such relational definitions also have an advantage in lattice gauge theories, where no ultraviolet divergences occur. To this end, we introduce QRFs for the gauge group via Wilson lines on a lattice with global boundary, realizing edge modes on the bulk entangling surface. Overcoming challenges of previous nonrelational approaches, we show that defining gauge-invariant subsystems associated with subregions relative to such QRFs naturally leads to a factorization across the surface, yielding distillable relational entanglement entropies. Distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic QRFs, according to whether they are built from the region or its complement, leads to extrinsic and intrinsic relational algebras ascribed to the region. The "electric center algebra" of previous approaches is recovered as the algebra that all extrinsic QRFs agree on, or by incoherently twirling any extrinsic algebra over the electric corner symmetry group. Similarly, a generalization of previous proposals for a "magnetic center algebra" is obtained as the algebra that all intrinsic QRFs agree on, or, in the Abelian case, by incoherently twirling any intrinsic algebra over a dual magnetic corner group. Altogether, this leads to a compelling regional algebra and relative entropy hierarchy. Invoking the corner twirls, we also find that the extrinsic/intrinsic relational entanglement entropies are upper bounded by the non-distillable electric/magnetic center entropies. Finally, using extrinsic QRFs, we discuss the influence of "asymptotic" symmetries on regional entropies. Our work thus unifies and extends previous approaches and reveals the interplay between entropies and regional symmetry structures.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to probe compact astrophysical objects and the distribution of dark matter at large scales. As a counterpart of photons, lensed relativistic neutrinos could also be used to explore properties of curved spacetimes. In the present paper we consider neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole (WH) spacetime in comparison with the widely discussed black hole (BH) spacetimes. We investigate the oscillations involving lensing effects with 2- and 3-flavor neutrinos under the weak-field approximation. In the two-flavor model, the flavor oscillation probabilities display the impacts of the throat radius, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the lightest neutrino mass. In the realistic 3-flavor case, the similar observations are obtained with the up-to-date global fit data of neutrino experiments. The influence of the Ellis WH on the coherence of neutrinos is also studied in the paper. In general, the observations from neutrino oscillations cannot be used to discriminate Ellis WH spacetimes from typical BH spacetimes under the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Modified General Relativity and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified General Relativity (MGR) is the natural extension of General Relativity (GR). MGR explicitly uses the smooth regular line element vector field $(\bm{X},-\bm{X}) $, which exists in all Lorentzian spacetimes, to construct a connection-independent symmetric tensor that represents the energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It solves the problem of the non-localization of gravitational energy-momentum in GR, preserves the ontology of the Einstein equation, and maintains the equivalence principle. The line element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation. The three classic tests of GR provide a comparison of the theories in the solar system and several parts of the cosmos. MGR provides the flexibility to describe inflation after the Big Bang and galactic anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation between Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the de Sitter spacetime-analysis with complex scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement generation or harvesting between two identical, comoving Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime. The detectors are assumed to be unentangled initially. They are individually coupled to a complex scalar field, which eventually leads to coupling between themselves. Two kinds of complex scalar fields are investigated here-conformally invariant and massless minimally coupled. By tracing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the scalar, we construct the reduced density matrix for the two detectors, whose eigenvalues characterise transition probabilities between the energy levels of the detectors. We have computed the negativity, quantifying the degree of entanglement generated at late times between the two detectors. The similarities and differences of these results between the aforementioned two kinds of scalar fields have been discussed. We also compare our results with the existing result of the real scalar field, and point out the qualitative differences. In particular, we emphasise that entanglement harvesting is more resilient in scenarios involving complex fields and nonlinear couplings.</description>

      <title>Quasilocal Newtonian limit of general relativity and galactic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new self-consistent perturbative expansion for realistic isolated differentially rotating systems -- disc galaxies. At leading order it is formally equivalent to Ehlers' Newton-Cartan limit, which we reinterpret in terms of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The self-consistent coupling of these quasilocal terms leads to first-order differences from the conventional Newtonian limit. A modified Poisson equation is obtained, along with modifications to the equations of motion for the effective fluid elements. By fitting to astrophysical data, we show that the phenomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies can be reproduced. Potential important consequences for gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Stable massless scalar polarization of f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization is a prominent feature of gravitational wave observations and can be used to distinguish between different modified gravity theories. Compared to General Relativity, f(R) gravity exhibits an additional polarization originating from a scalar field, which is a combination of the longitudinal and breathing modes. When the scalar mass of f(R) is zero, the mixed mode will reduce to a pure breathing mode with the disappearance of the longitudinal mode. However, this reducing seems to be disallowed because a positive scalar mass is often required to maintain the stability of the cosmological perturbation. In fact, the massless scalar case can provide a stable perturbation, but more detailed constraints need to be considered. For the completeness of the polarization analysis, we explore the possibility that there are stable massless scalar polarizations in viable dark energy f(R) models. We find that the existence of stable massless scalar polarization depends on the structure of f(R) model and can be used to distinguish different models in f(R) gravity.</description>

      <title>The Interconnection of Cosmological Constant and Renyi Entropy in Kalb-Ramond Black Holes : Insights from Thermodynamic Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks to establish a connection between the cosmological constant and Renyi entropy within the framework of Kalb-Raymond(K-R) gravity. Our analysis is supported by evidence showing the equivalence of the thermodynamic topology of K-R AdS black holes in the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistical framework and K-R flat black holes in the Renyi statistical framework. We begin by exploring the thermodynamic topology of K-R black holes in flat spacetimes, focusing on the topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in both statistical frameworks. We find that K-R flat black holes in Renyi statistics exhibit equivalent global and local topological properties to K-R AdS black holes in GB statistics. This equivalence points to a potential connection between the cosmological constant and the Renyi parameter. We derive an approximate relationship between the Renyi parameter and the cosmological constant, which is consistent with similar findings in the literature from a cosmological perspective.</description>

Abstract: The motion of particles hit by a burst of gravitational waves generated by flyby admits, for the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile, only a numerical description. The profile can however be approximated by the hyperbolic Scarf potential which admits an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our toy model is consistent with the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev provided the wave amplitude takes certain ``magical'' values.</description>

      <title>Toward a new definition of quasinormal modes in a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black holes are defined by their properties at infinite distances. It is believed that the quasinormal mode spectrum is discrete, but the derivation makes assumptions about finite distances. We prove that the spectrum is continuous if the usual definition is used, so a new definition is required if a discrete spectrum is desired. Within the usual definition, any frequency corresponds to a valid mode, and each frequency is two-fold degenerate. Even within the continuous spectrum, the fundamental least-damped discrete quasinormal mode should dominate the dynamics, due to its lack of an incoming component at finite distances. On the other hand, the discrete overtones are very similar to the continuum modes, since all highly-damped modes have very small incoming components. Furthermore, the continuous spectrum may be complete.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on inflationary decoherence with polynomial attractor model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations remains an unresolved fundamental problem, and quantum decoherence is one of the promising solutions. By considering quantum perturbations during inflation as an open quantum system interacting with its environment, quantum decoherence can be described by the Lindblad equation. This formalism modifies the evolution of primordial quantum perturbations and consequently alters the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, leading to observable consequences. In this paper, we examine the decoherence process of a polynomial attractor model featuring an ultra-slow-roll stage, extending previous analyses limited to slow-roll scenarios. We numerically compute the correction to the power spectrum due to quantum decoherence, and the results show significant modification only on large scales, with a peak generated by the decoherence correction at the minimum of the power spectrum. Using observational constraints on the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and requiring complete decoherence for relevant scales by the end of inflation, we obtain the constraint on the interaction parameter as $10^{-17}\text{Mpc}^{-1}&lt;k_\gamma&lt;0.061\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first precise calculations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode (QNM) frequencies for spinning black holes with dimensionless angular momenta $J/M^2 := a \lesssim 0.75$ in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. Using the \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS) framework, we compute the QNM frequencies of both axial and polar metric perturbations, focusing on the $nl m = 022$, $033$, and $032$ modes. The METRICS frequencies for the 022 mode achieve numerical uncertainties $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ when $0 \leq a \leq 0.5$ and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for $0.5 \leq a \leq 0.75$, without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations. We also derive optimal fitting polynomials to enable efficient and accurate evaluations of the leading-order frequency shifts in these modes. The METRICS frequencies and fitting expressions are a robust and indispensable step toward enabling gravitational-wave ringdown tests of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work reveals a direct correspondence between modified theories of gravity (cosmology) and entropic cosmology based on the thermodynamics of apparent horizon. It turns out that due to the total differentiable property of entropy, the usual thermodynamic law (used for Einstein gravity) needs to be generalized for modified gravity theories having more than one thermodynamic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.). For the modified theories having $n$ number of thermodynamic d.o.f., the corresponding horizon entropy is given by: $S_\mathrm{h} \sim S_\mathrm{BH} +$ terms containing the time derivatives of $S_\mathrm{BH}$ up to $(n-1)$-th order, and moreover, the coefficient(s) of the derivative term(s) are proportional to the modification parameter of the gravity theory (compared to the Einstein gravity; $S_\mathrm{BH}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy). By identifying the independent thermodynamic variables from the first law of thermodynamics, we show that the equivalent thermodynamic description of modified gravity naturally allows the time derivative of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically Charged Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>

Abstract: The generalized Gullstrand-Painleve geometry is investigated for expanding matter. Compared to other studies, we take into account an anisotropic stress tensor as the source of curvature with an equation of state resembling the MIT bag model form. The spacetime becomes de Sitter for $t&gt;&gt;1/\sqrt{\Lambda}, \Lambda$ being the equivalent cosmological constant. The energy density and pressures of the fluid are only time dependent but the scalar curvature is constant. The radial geodesics are computed.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the relativistic Lagrangian from the non-relativistic multiplicative Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian introduce an additional parameter that, despite its variation, results in identical equations of motion as those derived from the standard Lagrangian. This intriguing property becomes even more striking in the case of a free particle. By manipulating the parameter and integrating out, the statistical average of the multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian naturally arises. Astonishingly, from this statistical viewpoint, the relativistic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian emerge with remarkable elegance. On the action level, this formalism unveils a deeper connection: the spacetime of Einstein's theory reveals itself from a statistical perspective through the action associated with the multiplicative Lagrangian. This suggests that the multiplicative Lagrangian/Hamiltonian framework offers a profound and beautiful foundation, one that reveals the underlying unity between classical and relativistic descriptions in a way that transcends traditional formulations. In essence, the multiplicative approach introduces a richer and more intricate structure to our understanding of physics, bridging the gap between different theoretical realms through a statistical perspective.</description>

      <title>Open quantum battery in three-dimensional rotating black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <title>Mass inflation from rough initial data for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system with $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the strong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak, formulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric charged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near extremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely, when non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves propagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned family, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at the Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the possible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In line with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an instability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass inflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing the interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1) initial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to $W^{1, 2}\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q &gt; 2$, along the initial ingoing compact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the black hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference black hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth data suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a ``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected Price law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and rough initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charged black hole solutions of a 2+1 nonlinear electrodynamical theory with cosmological constant. Considered as a one-parameter group of theories (the exponent of the squared Maxwell tensor) the causal structure of all possible black holes is scrutinized. We analyze the singularity character that each theory delivers together with their horizons and the plausible limitations in the black hole charges. The investigation demonstrates a rich structure of three different groups of theories, according to the qualitative behavior of the singularity, horizons and limitations in the geometric charges. For such groups we study the effect of a scalar field propagating in the fixed black holes spacetime. All geometries analyzed were stable to such linear perturbations, these evolving as usual quasinormal spectra of the black holes that we calculate in different cases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

Abstract: We present a new class of regular, spherically symmetric spacetimes in nonlinear electrodynamics that are asymptotically dynamical but not de Sitter, exhibiting power-law Maxwell behavior at infinity. Generalizing to black holes, we derive their existence conditions and construct corresponding Penrose diagrams. Both the weak and dominant energy conditions are shown to be satisfiable. Magnetic solutions are first obtained, with electric counterparts derived via FP duality. Uniqueness conditions for the electric solutions are then established. Although electric duals are absent in square-root Maxwell theory, our auxiliary scalar formulation restores duality and enables a generalized duality transformation. The effective light propagation metric remains regular for particular magnetic configurations (without black holes) but becomes singular for electric cases. Additionally, spacelike photon trajectories are admitted in this spacetime. Finally, the ADM mass is shown to enter the Lagrangian, with the first law and Smarr formula derived, establishing the existence of thermodynamically stable black holes with positive heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Static Spherical Vacuum Solution to Bumblebee Gravity with Time-like VEVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved space-time solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski space-time exists. However, it is surprising that non-trivial solutions can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\), is satisfied. We argue that naturally these solutions are not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown fine-tuning mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, some properties of these novel but peculiar solutions are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we set up the theoretical framework and indicate future applications of symmetric Yang--Mills fields to cosmology. We analyze the coset space dimensional reduction scheme to construct pure Yang--Mills fields on spacetimes given as cylinders over cosets. Particular cases of foliations using $H^n$, dS$_n$ and AdS$_n$ slices as non-compact symmetric spaces are solved, compared to previous results in the literature, and generalized in a structured fashion. Coupling to general relativity in FLRW-type universes is introduced via the cosmological scale factor. For the hyperbolic slicing in 4D, the dynamics of the Einstein--Yang--Mills system is analytically solved and discussed. Finally, we generalize the analysis to warped foliations of the cylinders, which enlarge the range of possible spacetimes while also introducing a Hubble friction-like term in the equation of motion for the Yang--Mills field.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues). We also find that including further sources results in a rapid decrease in the anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: Glitches are non-Gaussian noise transients originating from environmental and instrumental sources that contaminate data from gravitational wave detectors. Some glitches can even mimic gravitational wave signals from compact object mergers, which are the primary targets of terrestrial observatories. In this study, we present a method to analyze noise transients from the LIGO observatories using Q-transform information combined with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We implement classification techniques, examine the influence of parameters on glitch classification, and conduct a week-long daily analysis to track outlier transients over time.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum for two-body scattering is determined by the radiation-reaction (RR) term in the one-loop waveform. This RR term is actually proportional to the tree-level waveform, and this reduces the calculation of the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss, $J_\text{2rad}$, to two loops, instead of three loops as one would expect by power counting. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <title>Impact of particle production during inflation on the CMB detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about three thousandths of that of primordial GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible. In contrast, their impact on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ proves significant. For a range of parameter values, the Starobinsky inflation model yields predictions for $n_s$ that are consistent with the measurements obtained from P+ACT+LB+BK18.</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Relativistic quantum Otto heat engine using a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity at work, or black holes in a forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, under a variety of scenarios, and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>On-shell Lagrangians as total derivatives and the generalized Komar charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians which transform homogeneously under a global transformation of the fields (a global rescaling, for instance) can be written on-shell as a total derivative which has a universal, solution-independent expression, using a functional version of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. We study the uniqueness of this expression and how this result can be used in the construction of generalized Komar charges.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>The Komar charge in presence of the Holst term and the gravitational Witten effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first-order formalism, the Einstein--Hilbert action can be modified by the addition of a Holst term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. This modification breaks parity although it does not affect the equations of motion. We show that the standard Komar charge is also modified by the addition of a topological term multiplied by the Barbero parameter $\alpha$. For the Killing vector that generates time translations, the value of the Komar integral at infinity is modified by the addition of a term proportional to the NUT charge $N$ and the parity-breaking Barbero parameter. Thus, as in the standard Witten effect, a non-vanishing NUT charge $N$ induces a non-vanishing mass $\alpha N$.</description>

      <title>Holography with Null Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key issues in holography is going beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the $T \overline{T}$ deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>
