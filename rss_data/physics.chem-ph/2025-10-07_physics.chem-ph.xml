      <title>Comprehensive \textsl{Ab Initio}~Calculations of \ce{CO2-H2} and \ce{CO2-He} Collisional Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive \textsl{ab initio} calculations of CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He collisional properties from first principles, employing CCSD(T), potential calculations together with close-coupling dynamical scattering in the \YUMI~framework. We derive (in)elastic cross sections, rate coefficients, and pressure-broadening parameters -- incl., their rotational dependence up to $|m|=50$, and temperature dependence over the range of 100-800 K. We provide Pad\'e fits for the broadening coefficients as a function of rotational quantum number, enabling extrapolation of the results and integration into spectroscopic databases, including HITRAN and HITEMP. The computed potentials for both CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He have a sub-percent precision, and the dynamics-solving code YUMI ultimately yields the collisional parameters. Among these, the scaled pressure broadening experimental values meet the 10\% precision requirement for exoplanetary sciences with \textit{JWST}. This contrasts with the parameters available before the present calculations, which at higher temperatures (T$&gt;$400 K) deviate as much as 5$\times$ from the desired precision requirement. All derivations and collisional properties are provided with this manuscript, establishing the first of such a comprehensive ab initio foundation for collisional systems with a target molecule having more than two atoms.</description>

      <title>Tritium Separation from Gaseous 1,2,3H Isotopologue Mixtures by Selective Adsorption on Ag-Exchanged Zeolite Type Y</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopologues is crucial for applications such as the recycling of exhaust streams in nuclear fusion reactors. Using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), we report, for the first time, on separation experiments of a ternary 1,2,3H isotope mixture, achieving tritium enrichment of 70% from an initially equimolar (1:1:1) gas mixture, based on selective adsorption using an Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite type Y. Further experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen temperature.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of contact time on leachate chemistry from recycled concrete aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH &gt; 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.</description>

      <title>Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theoretic Decomposition of Kubo-Greenwood Conductivities in the Projector Augmented Wave Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.</description>

      <title>Active learning and explicit electrostatics enable accurate modeling of electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer near-ab initio accuracy with the efficiency of classical force fields, making them attractive for modeling electrolytes. Collecting a diverse training set is essential for their accuracy and reliability, and explicit treatment of strong electrostatic interactions may be necessary. In this work, we demonstrated that active learning can automatically generate diverse training sets for moment tensor potentials (MTPs), enabling reliable molecular dynamics simulations of pure ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), their mixtures, and LiPF6 solutions. The resulting MTPs exhibit excellent transferability across various EC/EMC compositions, producing ionic conductivities within 11% mean deviations from experiments. In addition, we assessed the impact of explicitly incorporating electrostatics by extending MTP with a charge redistribution scheme. Our results show that this extended MTP achieves accuracy comparable to MTP for EC/EMC mixtures with fewer parameters and reproduces ionic conductivity with only a 6% mean deviation from experiment.</description>

      <title>Tracking Electron, Proton, and Solvent Motion in Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer with Ultrafast X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is foundational to catalysis, bioenergetics, and energy conversion, yet capturing and disentangling the coupled motions of electrons, protons, and solvent has remained a major experimental challenge. We combine femtosecond optical spectroscopy, site-specific ultrafast soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved X-ray scattering with advanced calculations to disentangle the elementary steps of PCET in solution. Using a ruthenium polypyridyl model complex, we directly resolve photoinduced electron redistribution, ligand-site protonation within 100 ps, and the accompanying solvent reorganization. This unified multi-modal approach provides an orbital-level, atomistic picture of PCET, showing how electronic, nuclear, and solvation degrees of freedom can be separated experimentally. Our results establish a general X-ray framework for understanding and ultimately controlling PCET in catalysis, artificial photosynthesis, and biological energy flow.</description>

      <title>A Universal Deep Learning Force Field for Molecular Dynamic Simulation and Vibrational Spectra Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of infrared (IR) and Raman spectra is essential for molecular identification and structural analysis. Traditional quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102 small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across diverse molecular and material systems.</description>

      <title>General framework for quantifying dissipation pathways in open quantum systems. III. Off-diagonal system-bath couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the previously reported theory of dissipation pathways [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)] to incorporate off-diagonal subsystem-bath coupling, which is often required to model molecular systems where the environment directly influences transitions and couplings between subsystem states. We systematically derive master equations for both population transfer and dissipation into individual bath components, for which we also rigorously prove energy conservation and detailed balance. The approach is based on second-order perturbation theory with respect to the subsystem-bath couplings, whose form is not limited to any specific model. The accuracy of the developed method is tested by applying it to diverse model Hamiltonians involving linearly coupled harmonic oscillator baths and comparing the outcomes against the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. Overall, our method accurately quantifies the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while significantly reducing the computational cost compared to numerically exact methods such as HEOM, thus offering a path to examine how vibronic interactions steer non-adiabatic processes in realistic chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Double-pair Coulomb(-Breit) photon correction to the correlated relativistic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$ fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The PPP model - a minimal viable parametrisation of conjugated chemistry for modern computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-empirical Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian is reviewed for its ability to provide a minimal model of the chemistry of conjugated $\pi$-electron systems, and its current applications and limitations are discussed. From its inception, the PPP Hamiltonian has helped in the development of new computational approaches in instances where compute is constrained due to its inherent approximations that allow for an efficient representation and calculation of many systems of chemical and technological interest. The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems. More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules. Finally, we conjecture how utilizing the PPP model in quantum computing applications could be mutually beneficial.</description>

      <title>Mixed-precision ab initio tensor network state methods adapted for NVIDIA Blackwell technology via emulated FP64 arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report cutting-edge performance results via mixed-precision spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) electronic structure calculations utilizing the Ozaki scheme for emulating FP64 arithmetic through the use of fixed-point compute resources. By approximating the underlying matrix and tensor algebra with operations on a modest number of fixed-point representatives (``slices''), we demonstrate on smaller benchmark systems and for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively, that the chemical accuracy can be reached with mixed-precision arithmetic. We also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new research directions in materials sciences and beyond.</description>

      <title>Finite elements and moving asymptotes accelerate quantum optimal control - FEMMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is central to designing spin manipulation pulses. While GRAPE efficiently computes gradients, realistic ensemble models make optimization time-consuming. In this work, we accelerated single-spin optimal control by combining the finite element method with the method of moving asymptotes. By treating discretized time as spatial coordinates, the Liouville-von Neumann equation was reformulated as a linear system, yielding gradients solving over an order of magnitude faster than GRAPE with less than one percent relative-accuracy loss. The moving asymptotes further improves convergence, outperforming L-BFGS and approaching Newton-level efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robust Kirkwood-Buff inversion in complex mixtures via reciprocal-space methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood-Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane-ethanol, water-urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.</description>

      <title>Chasing Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretic Simulation of Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics for Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</description>

      <title>Engineering the uncontrollable: Steering noisy spin-correlated radical-pairs with coherent and incoherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum control of spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs) holds promise for the targeted manipulation of magnetic field effects, with potential applications ranging from the design of noise-resilient quantum information processors to genetically encodable quantum sensors. However, achieving precise handles over the intricate interplay between coherent electron spin dynamics and incoherent relaxation processes in photoexcited radical-pair reactions requires tractable approaches for numerically obtaining controls for large, complex open quantum systems. Employing techniques relying on full Liouville-space propagators becomes computationally infeasible for large spin systems of realistic complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a control engineering approach based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) can offer a viable alternative by reporting on the successful application of PMP-optimal control to steer the coherent and incoherent spin dynamics of noisy radical pairs. This enables controls for prototypical radical-pair models that exhibit robustness in the face of relevant noise sources and paves the way to incoherent control of radical-pair spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large Differences Between Stochastic and Deterministic Kinetics in a Simple Autocatalytic Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In small systems, quantitative discrepancies between stochastic and deterministic descriptions of chemical kinetics can be significant, with their magnitude depending on the specific reaction network. Here, we study the Finke-Watzky model-an irreversible autocatalysis, A + B -- &gt; 2B, supplemented by an irreversible first-order process, A -- &gt; B. This model has been used to describe the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and protein misfolding and aggregation, but it may also serve as a minimal model for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. We show that, for certain parameter values, exceptionally large deviations can arise between stochastic and deterministic kinetics of the Finke-Watzky model. Moreover, its stochastic time evolution may be highly sensitive to initial conditions. These properties are retained in the generalization of the model to reversible reactions. To quantify the differences between the predictions of deterministic and stochastic kinetics, we derive the explicit analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watzky model. This solution also allows us to derive analogous solutions for two related reaction networks: A + A -- &gt; A + B, A -- &gt; B, and A + A -- &gt; A + B, A + B -- &gt; 2B. Our findings may have implications for modeling epidemics and intracellular chemical processes, and more broadly for models of population dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Accurately capturing the complex interaction between CO2 and water in porous media at the pore scale is essential for various geoscience applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). We introduce a comprehensive dataset generated from high-fidelity numerical simulations to capture the intricate interaction between CO2 and water at the pore scale. The dataset consists of 624 2D samples, each of size 512x512 with a resolution of 35 {\mu}m, covering 100 time steps under a constant CO2 injection rate. It includes various levels of heterogeneity, represented by different grain sizes with random variation in spacing, offering a robust testbed for developing predictive models. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information crucial for benchmarking machine learning models.</description>

      <title>NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recently it has been shown (Xiao et al, arXiv2505.18519) that a broad class of highly correlated wave-functions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we apply this approach and present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</description>

      <title>Harnessing multi-mode optical structure for chemical reactivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of controlling chemical reactivity using frequency-tunable optical microcavities has materialized over the past decade, evolving into a fascinating yet challenging new field of polaritonic chemistry, a multidisciplinary domain at the intersection of quantum optics, chemical dynamics, and non-equilibrium many-body physics. While most theoretical efforts to date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in polaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a series of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In this work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of chemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which multi-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario emerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi splitting. In such cases, hybridization between a rate-decisive molecular vibration and a central resonant cavity mode reshapes the resonance landscape, enabling additional reaction pathways mediated by adjacent cavity modes. The second scenario exploits the intrinsic anharmonicity of molecular vibrations, which gives rise to multiple dipole-allowed transitions with distinct energies. Under multi-mode strong coupling, where different cavity modes individually resonate with these distinct transitions, multi-photon processes involving sequential absorption across multiple modes become accessible. This leads to a nontrivial and non-additive rate enhancement via cascade-like vibrational ladder climbing. Together, these findings offer new strategies for tailoring chemical reactivity by harnessing the structural richness of multi-mode structure, offering valuable insights for optimal experimental designs in polaritonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>On the electronic path integral normal modes of the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss representation of nonadiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of nonadiabatic dynamics is highly desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a nonadiabatic Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154, 124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of truncating the higher path integral normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in conventional nuclear normal modes. Furthermore, truncating the dynamics in MMST normal modes leads to inaccurate correlation functions and while the QBD appears conserved for an ensemble of trajectories, it is not for a single trajectory. Overall, this suggests that MMST path integral normal modes are not optimal for obtaining an accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Based Periodic Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory with Implicit Solvation for Computational Electrochemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for grand canonical density functional theory (DFT) tailored to solid-state systems, employing Gaussian-type orbitals as the primary basis. Our approach directly minimizes the grand canonical free energy using the density matrix as the sole variational parameter, while self-consistently updating the electron number between self-consistent field iterations. To enable realistic electrochemical modeling, we integrate this approach with implicit solvation models. Our solvation scheme introduces less than 50% overhead relative to gas-phase calculations. Compared to existing plane wave-based implementations, our method shows improved robustness in grand canonical simulations. We validate the approach by modeling corrosion at silver surfaces, finding excellent agreement with previous studies. Our method is implemented in the quantum chemistry software Q-Chem. This work lays the groundwork for future wavefunction-based simulations beyond DFT under electrochemical operando conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07522v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach can describe the reduced dynamics of a system simultaneously coupled to multiple bosonic and fermionic environments. The complexity of exactly describing the system-environment interaction with the HEOM method usually results in time-consuming calculations and a large memory cost. Here, we introduce an open-source software package called HierarchicalEOM$.$jl: a Julia framework integrating the HEOM approach. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl features a collection of methods to compute bosonic and fermionic spectra, stationary states, and the full dynamics in the extended space of all auxiliary density operators (ADOs). The required handling of the ADOs multi-indexes is achieved through a user-friendly interface. We exemplify the functionalities of the package by analyzing a single impurity Anderson model, and an ultra-strongly coupled charge-cavity system interacting with bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. HierarchicalEOM$.$jl achieves a significant speedup with respect to the corresponding method in the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), upon which this package is founded.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic geometric framework for Fock space coupled cluster theory in second quantization. In quantum chemistry, many-electron states are represented as elements of the exterior algebra. The fermionic creation and annihilation operators generate the Fermi-Dirac algebra, which can be realized as a Clifford algebra acting on the exterior algebra. We present a non-commutative Gr\"obner basis for the Fermi-Dirac algebra; offering an alternative proof of Wick's theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory. In coupled cluster theory, eigenpairs of the Schr\"odinger equation are approximated by a hierarchy of polynomial equations corresponding to different levels of truncation. The coupled cluster exponential parameterization of quantum states gives rise to Fock space truncation varieties. This reveals well-known varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag varieties and spinor varieties. We offer a detailed study of the truncation varieties, providing an explicit description of their defining equations and dimension. Furthermore, we classify all cases in which their coupled cluster degree coincides with the degree of the graph of the exponential parameterization - most notably for singleton truncations such as CCD and for the Schubert like truncation varieties such as the Grassmannian, flag variety and the spinor variety.</description>

      <title>QCBench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Domain-Specific Quantitative Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative chemistry is central to modern chemical research, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform its rigorous, step-by-step calculations remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry oriented benchmark comprising 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields, which contains analytical chemistry, bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry. To systematically evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), they are categorized into three tiers: easy, medium, and difficult. Each problem, rooted in realistic chemical scenarios, is structured to prevent heuristic shortcuts and demand explicit numerical reasoning. QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork for future improvements such as domain-adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal integration. Evaluations on 24 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy. Code for QCBench is available at https://github.com/jiaqingxie/QCBench.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized chiral ZnIn2S4 for targeted solar-driven CO2 reduction to acetic acid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target product for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply. Although photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCCR) can generate acetic acid alongside other multicarbon products, its yield is typically low, limited by competing reactions and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 (CMZI) photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 {umol g-1 h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3 %. This yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity10. The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic effect between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on {102} crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction toward the efficient and scalable synthesis of various multicarbon products.</description>

Abstract: Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</description>
