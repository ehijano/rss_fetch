      <title>Pulsating Detonation Induced by Flash Boiling of Liquid Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a computational and theoretical investigation into propagation of liquid ammonia detonation, with the emphasis on assessing the impact of fuel evaporation on detonation stability. The prominent discovery is that the flash boiling of liquid ammonia leads to the decoupling of the shock and combustion waves and creates a pulsating propagation of the detonation. Theoretical nonlinear stability analysis reveals that detonation instability arises when evaporation and chemical timescales are comparable, while stability is maintained when these timescales are well separated. This work provides the first mechanistic insight into the instability of liquid ammonia normal detonation, offering crucial guidance for the design of efficient ammonia-fueled detonation engines.</description>

      <title>Slip length estimation for flow over lubricant-impregnated surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubricant-impregnated surfaces (LIS) and superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) are known to passively reduce drag over a surface, which, with a suitable design such as the ribbed texture, can also steer flows anisotropically. Analytical predictions are developed for ribbed textures using an eigenfunction expansion approach. Compared to currently available analytical predictions, these predictions demonstrate superior numerical accuracy and avoid restrictive assumptions on rib geometry, working fluid and lubricant properties. The predictions provide contrasting design prescriptions depending on whether a lower drag or a larger degree of anisotropic flow deflection is desired.</description>

      <title>Emergent Geometry Governs Optimal Control in Driven Stokes Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a canonical Stokes flow geometry, the Hele-Shaw cell, we show that tunable circulations induced by Lorentz forces in a conducting fluid enable particle control. We reveal that energy-optimal control paths correspond to geodesics of an emergent Riemannian metric, which are time-optimal under a maximum-power constraint. Particle paths exhibit metric-governed anisotropic diffusion under random boundary forcing. Our geometric concepts, though developed explicitly for circulation-driven Hele-Shaw flows, generalize to generic driven Stokes flows and so elucidate recent observations in a three-dimensional context.</description>

      <title>Solving Navier-Stokes Equations Using Data-free Physics-Informed Neural Networks With Hard Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful and robust framework for solving nonlinear differential equations across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, including biology, geophysics, astrophysics and fluid dynamics. In the PINN framework, the governing partial differential equations, along with initial and boundary conditions, are encoded directly into the loss function, enabling the network to learn solutions that are consistent with the underlying physics. In this work, we employ the PINN framework to solve the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for three two-dimensional incompressible, steady, laminar flow problems without using any labeled data. The boundary and initial conditions are enforced in a hard manner, ensuring they are satisfied exactly rather than penalized during training. We validate the PINN predicted velocity profiles, drag coefficients and pressure profiles against the conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for moderate to high values of Reynolds number ($Re$). It is observed that the PINN predictions show good agreement with the CFD results at lower $Re$. We also extend our analysis to a transient condition and find that our method is equally capable of simulating complex time-dependent flow dynamics. To quantitatively assess the accuracy, we compute the $L_2$ normalized error, which lies in the range $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for our chosen case studies.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided Bayesian neural networks for zonal corrections and uncertainty quantification in separated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques have improved the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models in fluid dynamics. However, modeling separated flows remains challenging due to their complex physics and sensitivity to local conditions. Existing approaches often struggle with generalization beyond training cases and lack robust uncertainty quantification frameworks, limiting their utility in complex flow regimes. We propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based framework specifically designed for two-dimensional separated flows. By focusing on flow zones near separated regions, we ensure targeted training and enhance predictive reliability. The BNN framework incorporates physics-guided, invariant inputs to maintain consistency with turbulence physics. Correction terms predicted by the BNN are selectively applied to specific regions of the flow domain using a novel classifier, improving accuracy. A key feature of this approach is propagating BNN-derived corrections to flow solutions, enabling uncertainty quantification in unseen test cases. This probabilistic characterization of modeling errors offers insights into the reliability of RANS predictions across geometries with similar topologies. Preliminary results demonstrate that this method accurately predicts correction terms for Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy production in separated flow regions, effectively addressing dominant modeling errors and advancing turbulence modeling through uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty analysis of URANS simulations coupled with an anisotropic pressure fluctuation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fluctuations in turbulent flows is essential for understanding flow-induced vibration and structural fatigue. This study investigates the role of turbulence model parameter uncertainty in such predictions using a combination of global sensitivity analysis, surrogate modeling, and Bayesian inference. The methodology is applied to two fluid-only flow cases: turbulent channel flow and turbulent annular flow. In the channel flow case, calibrated parameter distributions lead to improved agreement with reference data. In the annular case, limited parameter identifiability is observed, though predictions remain consistent with high-fidelity trends. The results demonstrate both the potential and limitations of model calibration strategies in wall-bounded turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Online learning of subgrid-scale models for quasi-geostrophic turbulence in planetary interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to represent subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics is now well established in weather forecasting and climate modelling. Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.</description>

      <title>Extended Physics Informed Neural Network for Hyperbolic Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.</description>

      <title>Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.</description>

      <title>Inertial active particles in a Poiseuille flow: negative mobility and particle separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\langle v \rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of surface tension in terms of force gradient per unit area -- Part I : a thought experiment using the principle of equivalence in fluid mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventionally, surface tension is expressed as a force per unit length or as an energy per unit area. In this paper, we propose a thought experiment that consists of replacing the surface tension with an equivalent force per unit area according to the principles of fluid mechanics. Such a system of equivalent forces makes it possible to analyze the surface tension phenomenon in terms of surface stress gradient or in terms of energy per unit volume and allows us to rewrite the known equations by calculating the equilibrium of forces in the stationary state. These new equations will be applied to known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube, Wilhelmy blade and equilibrium of drops and semi-drops.</description>

      <title>Energy, enstrophy and helicity transfers in polymeric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise the scale-by-scale transfers of energy, enstrophy and helicity in homogeneous and isotropic polymeric turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The microscale Reynolds number is set to $Re_\lambda \approx 460$, and the Deborah number $De = \tau_p/\tau_f$ is varied between $1/9 \le De \le 9$; $\tau_p$ is the polymeric relaxation time and $\tau_f$ is the turnover time of the largest scales of the flow. The study relies on the exact scale-by-scale budget equations (derived from the the governing model equations) for energy, enstrophy and helicity, which account for the back-reaction of the polymers on the flow. Polymers act as a sink/source in the flow, and provide alternative routes for the scale-by-scale transfers of the three quantities, whose relevance changes with $De$. We find that polymers deplete the nonlinear energy cascade mainly at smaller scales, by weakening both the extreme forward as well as reverse local events. The new polymer-driven energy flux dominates at small scales for $De \ge 1$, and on average transfers energy from larger to smaller scales with localised backscatter events. Polymers weaken the stretching of vorticity with the enstrophy being mainly generated by the fluid-polymer interaction, especially when $De \ge 1$. Accordingly, an inspection of the small-scale flow topology shows that polymers favour events with two-dimensional state of straining, and promote/inhibit extreme extension/rotation events: in polymeric turbulence shear and planar extensional flows are more probable. The helicity injected at the largest scales shows a similar transfer process to as energy, being mainly driven by the nonlinear cascade at large scales and by the polymer-driven flux at small scales. Polymers are found to favour events that break the small-scale mirror symmetry, with the relative helicity monotonically increasing with $De$ at all scales.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental investigation examining how the complexity of pitching kinematics influences dynamic stall characteristics, including the stall delay and aerodynamic force response. The study examines whether the pitch rate defined at the static stall angle adequately characterises time-varying pitching kinematics for stall onset prediction. We then evaluate the performance of the generalised Goman-Khrabrov model in predicting force responses of nonlinear pitching motions and propose necessary modifications to extend the model's applicability to complex kinematics.</description>

      <title>Quaternion wavefunction development of incompressible inviscid fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quaternion wavefunction formulation that reduces the incompressible Euler equations to a single nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation. The velocity field emerges from a complex quaternion wavefunction $\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H}$ satisfying a constrained Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with incompressibility enforced through a holomorphic constraint on quaternion space. This formulation preserves all conservation laws through a natural Lagrangian structure and reduces the system from four coupled nonlinear equations (three velocity components plus pressure) to one quaternion field equation with an algebraic constraint. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving analytical solutions for three-dimensional flow past a sphere, obtaining the drag coefficient $C_D \approx 0.47$ at Reynolds number Re $= 1000$ and predicting the onset of vortex shedding at $\text{Re}_c \approx 270$, in excellent agreement with experiments. The formulation provides a new mathematical framework for inviscid fluid dynamics and suggests efficient numerical algorithms exploiting quaternion structure.</description>

      <title>Fluid-kinetic multiscale solver for wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-level (fluid-kinetic) coupling procedure for the simulation of wall-bounded flows at Reynolds numbers up to thousands. The method combines a kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) treatment of the near-wall layer, with a high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as a fluid solver in the bulk flow. Given the kinetic nature of HOLB, this coupling is expected to provide a physically accurate treatment of the near-wall instabilities which trigger the transition to turbulence above a critical threshold around $Re_c \sim 750$.
  The coupled DSMC-HOLB solver is validated by simulating plane Poiseuille and Couette flows far from equilibrium, i.e at finite Knudsen number regimes. Based on this validation, we provide the first preliminary evidence that the combination of HOLB and DSMC permits to observe the regeneration cycles of coherent structures which arise above a critical value of the Reynolds number. This task would be hardly attainable by either of the two solvers separately; while DSMC can capture strong near-wall non-equilibrium effects, it lacks the compute power to deal with both near-wall and bulk flow at the same time. We look to HOLB to make it computationally feasible to perform such a simulation. The present two-level coupling procedure may pave the way to a new generation of fluid-kinetic simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows, thus helping to gain deeper insights into the role of wall micro-corrugations in triggering the dynamic instabilities that drive the transition to turbulent regimes.</description>

      <title>Taylors hypothesis and its impact on flux measurements in a forest clearcut</title>

Abstract: Taylors hypothesis is the backbone to convert observations done over time to spatial information of the flow while carrying out turbulence measurements on a micrometeorological tower. To address its validity over a highly heterogeneous forest clearcut surface, we utilize an extensive Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) datasets. The DTS measured space-time correlation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk convective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height of 3.1 m above the clearing. These convective speeds are compared with the mean wind speed and turbulent intensities of streamwise velocities obtained from the EC system at the middle of the clearcut. Depending on if is parallel or perpendicular to the forest edge, the relationships between and are significantly different. However, irrespective of the wind direction, the convective speeds of temperature structures at inertial subrange scales behave in a power-law fashion with increasing wavenumbers. The exponent of this power-law differs from a homogeneous atmospheric surface layer flow, thereby pointing towards the effects of heterogeneity. The scale-dependent convective speeds non-linearly transform the temporal frequencies to streamwise wavenumbers, which, eventually, impacts the properties of turbulence (co) spectra. More importantly, this non-linear transformation yields a critical frequency limit, beyond which the eddy length scales derived from frequencies are smaller than the physical dimension of the sonic anemometers, and therefore, cannot be faithfully resolved. This critical limit questions the EC flux estimates beyond this frequency.</description>

      <title>FoilDiff: A Hybrid Transformer Backbone for Diffusion-based Modelling of 2D Airfoil Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</description>
