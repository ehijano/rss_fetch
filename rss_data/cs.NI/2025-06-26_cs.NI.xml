      <title>MILAAP: Mobile Link Allocation via Attention-based Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information (i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale, thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks. In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral, spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability across different periods of CS sequences.</description>

      <title>Notes on Degeneracy and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degeneracy is the ability of structurally different elements to perform the same function or yield the same output under certain constraints. In contrast to redundancy, which implies identical backups, degeneracy allows diverse components to step in and perform the same or similar role. Mathematically, it is about mapping multiple distinct elements into the same function. In a degenerate system, failure in one part can be compensated by others not structurally linked. System functions are distributed within the system itself or the entire network. This renders faster and more adaptive recovery. In this work, we define and formulate several novel metrics for resource fungibility to address robustness in networks (static/mobile/dynamic).</description>

      <title>A clusterability test for directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend a statistical test of graph clusterability, the $\delta$ test, to directed graphs with no self loops. The $\delta$ test, originally designed for undirected graphs, is based on the premise that graphs with a clustered structure display a mean local density that is statistically higher than the graph's global density. We posit that graphs that do not meet this necessary (but not sufficient) condition for clusterability can be considered unsuited to clustering. In such cases, vertex clusters do not offer a meaningful summary of the broader graph. Additionally in this study, we aim to determine the optimal sample size (number of neighborhoods). Our test, designed for the analysis of large networks, is based on sampling subsets of neighborhoods/nodes. It is designed for cases where computing the density of every node's neighborhood is infeasible. Our results show that the $\delta$ test performs very well, even with very small samples of neighborhoods ($1\%$). It accurately detects unclusterable graphs and is also shown to be robust to departures from the underlying assumptions of the $t$ test.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Measurement View on IPv6 Scanners and Their Adaption to BGP Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanners are daily visitors of public IPv4 hosts. Scanning IPv6 nodes successfully is still a challenge, which an increasing crowd of actors tries to master. In this paper, we analyze current IPv6 scanning under various network conditions. We observe scanner behavior during eleven months in four network telescopes, one of which is periodically reconfigured by changing BGP announcements. We analyze and classify the observed scanners w.r.t. their temporal behavior, their target, and network selection strategy, as well as their individual tools, fingerprints, and correlations across categories. We find that silent subnets of larger prefixes remain invisible, whereas BGP prefix announcements quickly attract attention by scanners. Based on our findings, we derive operational guidance on how to deploy network telescopes to increase visibility of IPv6 scanners.</description>

      <title>Semantic Caching for Improving Web Affordability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of web content has led to increasingly large webpages, posing significant challenges for Internet affordability, especially in developing countries where data costs remain prohibitively high. We propose semantic caching using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve web affordability by enabling reuse of semantically similar images within webpages. Analyzing 50 leading news and media websites, encompassing 4,264 images and over 40,000 image pairs, we demonstrate potential for significant data transfer reduction, with some website categories showing up to 37% of images as replaceable. Our proof-of-concept architecture shows users can achieve approximately 10% greater byte savings compared to exact caching. We evaluate both commercial and open-source multi-modal LLMs for assessing semantic replaceability. GPT-4o performs best with a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error of 0.1735 and a weighted F1 score of 0.8374, while the open-source LLaMA 3.1 model shows comparable performance, highlighting its viability for large-scale applications. This approach offers benefits for both users and website operators, substantially reducing data transmission. We discuss ethical concerns and practical challenges, including semantic preservation, user-driven cache configuration, privacy concerns, and potential resistance from website operators</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Domain Name System: A Comprehensive System-Level Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a foundational role in Internet infrastructure, yet its core protocols remain vulnerable to compromise by quantum adversaries. As cryptographically relevant quantum computers become a realistic threat, ensuring DNS confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity in the post-quantum era is imperative. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system-level study of post-quantum DNS security across three widely deployed mechanisms: DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). We propose Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)-DNS, a unified framework for benchmarking DNS security under legacy, post-quantum, and hybrid cryptographic configurations. Our implementation leverages the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) libraries and integrates lattice- and hash-based primitives into BIND9 and TLS 1.3 stacks. We formalize performance and threat models and analyze the impact of post-quantum key encapsulation and digital signatures on end-to-end DNS resolution. Experimental results on a containerized testbed reveal that lattice-based primitives such as Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (MLKEM) and Falcon offer practical latency and resource profiles, while hash-based schemes like SPHINCS+ significantly increase message sizes and processing overhead. We also examine security implications including downgrade risks, fragmentation vulnerabilities, and susceptibility to denial-of-service amplification. Our findings inform practical guidance for deploying quantum-resilient DNS and contribute to the broader effort of securing core Internet protocols for the post-quantum future.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on the Cloud Computing Risk Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally altered the information technology (IT) risk landscape, particularly in cloud computing environments. This paper examines how this geopolitical conflict has accelerated data sovereignty concerns, transformed cybersecurity paradigms, and reshaped cloud infrastructure strategies worldwide. Through an analysis of documented cyber operations, regulatory responses, and organizational adaptations between 2022 and early 2025, this research demonstrates how the conflict has served as a catalyst for a broader reassessment of IT risk. The research reveals that while traditional IT risk frameworks offer foundational guidance, their standard application may inadequately address the nuances of state-sponsored threats, conflicting data governance regimes, and the weaponization of digital dependencies without specific geopolitical augmentation. The contribution of this paper lies in its focused synthesis and strategic adaptation of existing best practices into a multi-layered approach. This approach uniquely synergizes resilient cloud architectures (including sovereign and hybrid models), enhanced data-centric security strategies (such as advanced encryption and privacy-enhancing technologies), and geopolitically-informed governance to build digital resilience. The interplay between these layers, emphasizing how geopolitical insights directly shape architectural and security choices beyond standard best practices-particularly by integrating the human element, including personnel vulnerabilities and expertise, as a core consideration in technical design and operational management-offers a more robust defense against the specific, multifaceted risks arising from geopolitical conflict in increasingly fractured digital territories.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Vulnerability Detection in 6G Wireless Networks: Advances, Case Study, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of 6G wireless networks, IoT, and edge computing has significantly expanded the cyberattack surface, necessitating more intelligent and adaptive vulnerability detection mechanisms. Traditional security methods, while foundational, struggle with zero-day exploits, adversarial threats, and context-dependent vulnerabilities in highly dynamic network environments. Generative AI (GAI) emerges as a transformative solution, leveraging synthetic data generation, multimodal reasoning, and adaptive learning to enhance security frameworks. This paper explores the integration of GAI-powered vulnerability detection in 6G wireless networks, focusing on code auditing, protocol security, cloud-edge defenses, and hardware protection. We introduce a three-layer framework comprising the Technology Layer, Capability Layer, and Application Layer to systematically analyze the role of VAEs, GANs, LLMs, and GDMs in securing next-generation wireless ecosystems. To demonstrate practical implementation, we present a case study on LLM-driven code vulnerability detection, highlighting its effectiveness, performance, and challenges. Finally, we outline future research directions, including lightweight models, high-authenticity data generation, external knowledge integration, and privacy-preserving technologies. By synthesizing current advancements and open challenges, this work provides a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness GAI for building resilient and adaptive security solutions in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Scheduling of Periodic Messages for Low Latency in Cloud RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.07029v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-RAN (C-RAN) is a cellular network architecture where processing units, previously attached to antennas, are centralized in data centers. The main challenge in meeting protocol time constraints is minimizing the latency of periodic messages exchanged between antennas and processing units. We demonstrate that statistical multiplexing introduces significant logical latency due to buffering at network nodes to prevent collisions. To address this, we propose a deterministic scheme for periodic message transmission without collisions, eliminating latency caused by buffering.
  We develop several algorithms to compute such schemes for star-routed networks, a common topology where all antennas share a single link. First, we show that deterministic transmission is possible without buffering when routes are short or network load is low. Under high load, we allow buffering at processing units and introduce the Periodic Minimal Latency Scheduling (PMLS) algorithm, adapted from classical scheduling methods. Experimental results indicate that even at full load, PMLS finds deterministic transmission schemes with negligible logical latency, whereas statistical multiplexing incurs substantial delays. Moreover, PMLS runs in polynomial time and scales efficiently to hundreds of antennas. Building on this approach, we also derive low-latency periodic transmission schemes that coexist with additional random network traffic. This article extends previous work presented at ICT.</description>

      <title>Distributed satellite information networks: Architecture, enabling technologies, and trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.</description>
