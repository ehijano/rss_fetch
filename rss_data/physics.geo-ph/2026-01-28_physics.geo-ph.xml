      <title>Spread/Error relationship and spatial error structure of precipitation ensemble nowcasting: Comparison of STEPS and generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictability of the generative AI-based nowcasting model LDCast (trained on another region) is evaluated over Belgium, together with the pysteps implementation of the nowcasting algorithm STEPS. STEPS and LDCast are slightly underdispersive, but the ensemble spread provides an estimation of the error at almost all scales. Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members. This suggests that the content of STEPS and LDCast ensembles is informative in terms of statistics, but not in terms of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field topology for several distinct pathways, (i) an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid, (ii) a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile, and (iii) magnetization in the turbulent solar nebula disk. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. We also find that (iii) a field produced earlier before the solar nebula cleared, would be highly multipolar. In cases (i) and (ii) we also place constraints on the field strength. Simple detection of a magnetic field without constraining its topology and temporal variability would be insufficient to confirm a remanent source, due to the influence of the present-day solar wind, electromagnetic induction, and (16) Psyche's high obliquity. For sufficiently strong fields however, the field topology and orientation may reveal key observable consequences of the nature and history of (16) Psyche. Our framework is also broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15809v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>
