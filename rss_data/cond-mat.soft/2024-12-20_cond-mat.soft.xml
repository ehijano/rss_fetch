      <title>Radius of Gyration in Shear Gradient Direction Governs Steady Shear Viscosity of Rouse-Type Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stress tensor and the gyration tensor of an unentangled polymer melt under flow by using a Rouse-type single chain model. We employ the bead-spring type single chain model, in which beads interact each other via nonlinear potentials such as the finite-extensible nonlinear elasticity (FENE) potential. Beads are assumed to obey the Langevin equation with a constant friction coefficient. We derive simple yet general relations between the stress tensor and the gyration tensor for this Rouse-type model, without any additional approximations. Various formulae for rheological quantities in terms of the gyration tensor can be derived from the general relations. For example, the steady shear viscosity is governed by the gyration radius in the shear gradient direction.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamics in macroscopic photoactive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the collective behavior of macroscopic self-propelled particles that are externally excited by light. This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Real space solution of inhomogeneous elastic wave equation with localized vibration and flat dispersion relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low frequency vibrational anomaly known as Boson peak (BP) have been studied extensively in various disordered systems, however its origin and theoretical description are still under debate. In this work, as one of the simplest model for describing vibrational properties in disordered systems, inhomogeneous elastic wave equation, is solved in real space without using perturbative approach as previous works. In real space solution, the BP associated flat dispersion relation can be obtained, localized vibration in exponential decay in soft spot can be observed, and the fluctuation length of shear modulus dependent BP frequency is also confirmed. These features have been reported in recent progresses but missed within perturbative approach. This work unify divergent and controversial conclusions of BP within a simple model of fluctuating shear modulus under clear visualization.</description>

      <title>Coexisting multiphase and interfacial behaviour of ouzo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component liquid mixtures can be both complex and fascinating, with some systems being amenable to simple experimentation at home, giving valuable insight into fundamental aspects of bulk and interfacial phase behaviour. One particularly interesting mixture is the popular drink ouzo, which has charmed both the general public and scientists by virtue of its ability to display spontaneous emulsification when water is added. When these two clear (and potable) liquids are poured into each other, a single milky-coloured liquid is formed. In previous work [Archer et al., Soft Matter 20, 5889 (2024)], the equilibrium phase-diagram for the stable liquid phases of ouzo was captured via experiment and modelling. Here we consider the case when the two liquid phases also coexist with the vapour phase (i.e. along a line of triple points) and within our model uncover the complex bulk phase behaviour for this simple beverage. As a consequence, this leads to some interesting observations, that also apply more widely, about visualising phase diagrams in ternary systems of this type. We also examine the interfacial behaviour, connecting microscopic density functional theory results with macroscopic (Neumann) predictions for the shape of droplets at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Frictional contact between solids: A fully Eulerian phase-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated that fully Eulerian methods can effectively model frictionless contact between deformable solids. Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Casimir effect in wetting layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a long time, the study of thermal effects at three-dimensional (3D) short-ranged wetting transitions considered only the effect of interfacial fluctuations. We show that an entropic Casimir contribution, missed in previous treatments, produces significant effects when it is included; in particular, mean-field predictions are no longer obtained when interfacial fluctuations are ignored. The Casimir term arises from the many different microscopic configurations that correspond to a given interfacial one. By employing a coarse-graining procedure, starting from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian, we identify the interfacial model for 3D wetting and the exact form of the Casimir term. The Casimir contribution does not alter the Nakanishi-Fisher surface phase diagram; it significantly increases the adsorption near a first-order wetting transition and completely changes the predicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting, including the nonuniversality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial fluctuations. We illustrate how the Casimir term leads to a reappraisal of the critical singularities at wetting transitions.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>From Nonequilibrium to Equilibrium: Insights from a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of a Water Droplet onto a Horizontally Vibrating Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</description>

      <title>A continuum geometric approach for inverse design of origami structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Miura-Ori, a celebrated origami pattern that facilitates functionality in matter, has found multiple applications in the field of mechanical metamaterials. Modifications of Miura-Ori pattern can produce curved configurations during folding, thereby enhancing its potential functionalities. Thus, a key challenge in designing generalized Miura-Ori structures is to tailor their folding patterns to achieve desired geometries. In this work, we address this inverse-design problem by developing a new continuum framework for the differential geometry of generalized Miura-Ori. By assuming that the perturbation to the classical Miura-Ori is slowly varying in space, we derive analytical relations between geometrical properties and the perturbation field. These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Condensation and Synchronization in Aligning Chiral Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00458</link>

Abstract: We show that spontaneous density segregation in dense systems of aligning circle swimmers is a condensation phenomenon at odds with the phase separation scenarios usually observed in two-dimensional active matter. The condensates, which take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite fraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing size as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and continuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and both identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies synchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local interactions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms that accounts qualitatively for our results.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual rewards promote collective transport using individually controlled swarm microrobots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20041</link>

Abstract: Swarm robots offer fascinating opportunities to perform complex tasks beyond the capabilities of individual machines. Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.</description>
