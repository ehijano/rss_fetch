      <title>Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library -- The Intractable Decathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through recent progress in hardware development, quantum computers have advanced to the point where benchmarking of (heuristic) quantum algorithms at scale is within reach. Particularly in combinatorial optimization -- where most algorithms are heuristics -- it is key to empirically analyze their performance on hardware and track progress towards quantum advantage. To this extent, we present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically-relevant applications, with the goal to enable systematic, fair, and comparable benchmarks for quantum optimization methods. Further, we introduce the Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library (QOBLIB) where the problem instances and solution track records can be found. The individual properties of the problem classes vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density. Crucially, they all become challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes ranging from less than 100 to, at most, an order of 100,000 decision variables, allowing to approach them with today's quantum computers. We reference the results from state-of-the-art solvers for instances from all problem classes and demonstrate exemplary baseline results obtained with quantum solvers for selected problems. The baseline results illustrate a standardized form to present benchmarking solutions, which has been designed to ensure comparability of the used methods, reproducibility of the respective results, and trackability of algorithmic and hardware improvements over time. We encourage the optimization community to explore the performance of available classical or quantum algorithms and hardware platforms with the benchmarking problem instances presented in this work toward demonstrating quantum advantage in optimization.</description>

      <title>The firewall paradox is Wigner's friend paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The firewall paradox, a puzzle in black hole physics, depends on an implicit assumption: a rule that allows the infalling and the outside observer to combine their perspectives. However, a recent extension of the Wigner's friend paradox shows that such a combination rule conflicts with quantum theory $\unicode{x2013}$ without involving gravity. This challenges the usual conclusion of the firewall paradox, that standard quantum gravity assumptions are incompatible. More generally, black hole puzzles and Wigner's friend puzzles are closely related by a correspondence. This suggests that the firewall paradox may be a symptom of the same fundamental issue that leads to the extended Wigner's friend paradox.</description>

      <title>Predicting energy of the quantum system from one- and two- electron integrals using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a descriptor for molecular electronic structure that is based solely on the one- and two-electron integrals but is translationally, rotationally, and unitarily invariant. Then, directly exploiting size consistency, we train and then fine-tune a neural network to predict the energies of strongly-correlated systems, specifically hydrogen clusters. Because our network uses and preserves size-consistency, training on few-electron systems can guide predictions for systems with more electrons.</description>

      <title>Encoding quantum-like information in classical synchronizing dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a formalism that maps classical networks of nonlinear oscillators onto a quantum-like Hilbert space. We demonstrated that specific network transformations correspond to quantum gates, underscoring the potential of classical many-body systems as platforms for quantum-inspired information processing. In this paper, we extend this framework by systematically identifying the classical dynamics best suited for this purpose. Specifically, we address the question: Can the collective steady state of a classical network encode signatures of quantum information? We prove that the answer is affirmative for a special class of synchronizing many-body systems, namely, a complex-field extension of the Kuramoto model of nonlinearly coupled classical oscillators. Through this approach, we investigate how quantum-like entangled states can emerge from classical synchronization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiqubit GHZ state preparation with $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$ ions for frequency standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state preparation is demonstrated on two to eight qubits in the chain of ten $^{171}Yb^+$ ions in the linear Paul trap with a sequence of single-qubit and two-qubit operations and pulsed dynamical decupling. Fidelity of the 8-qubit GHZ state is estimated to be $58.9 \pm 0.6\%$. The expected enhanced sensitivity of the parity oscillations phase to the analyzing pulse phase is observed. This result is a step towards a multi-ion optical clock with ytterbium ions with frequency averaging following $1/N$ scaling law in contrast to the slower $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling for an ensemble of independent particles in case when the decoherence is dominated by the spontaneous decay.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution with Qubit-like States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols most often use two conjugate bases in order to verify the security of the quantum channel. In the majority of protocols, these bases are mutually unbiased to one another, which is to say they are formed from balanced superpositions of the entire set of states in the opposing basis. Here, we introduce a high-dimensional QKD protocol using qubit-like states, referred to as Fourier-qubits (or $\textit{F}$-qubits). In our scheme, each $\textit{F}$-qubit is a superposition of only two computational basis states with a relative phase that can take $d$ distinct values, where $d$ is the dimension of the computational basis. This non-mutually unbiased approach allows us to bound the information leaked to an eavesdropper, maintaining security in high-dimensional quantum systems despite the states' seemingly two-dimensional nature. By simplifying state preparation and measurement, our protocol offers a practical alternative for secure high-dimensional quantum communications. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol for a noisy high-dimensional QKD channel using the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of light and discuss the potential benefits for encoding in other degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of randomness in Bell's experiment indicates 'Realism' is false</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WWe measure time evolution of Minimum Entropy and (estimated) Kolmogorov's Complexity of binary time series during short pulses in a specially designed optical Bell's experiment. We compare evolution between the cases with stations placed close and separated 24m in straight line. This provides a clue about which one of the hypotheses necessary for the derivation and observation of Bell's inequalities is false. This is a foundational problem that has consequences in the field of random numbers' generation. Our results are consistent (95% statistical significance) with falsity of 'Realism' as defined to derive the Bell's inequalities, in agreement with the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Unrelated to the foundational problem, our observations have practical impact on the efficient use of quantum Random Number Generators and Quantum Key Distribution devices.</description>

      <title>Q-GEAR: Improving quantum simulation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast execution of complex quantum circuit simulations are crucial for verification of theoretical algorithms paving the way for their successful execution on the quantum hardware. However, the main stream CPU-based platforms for circuit simulation are well-established but slower. Despite this, adoption of GPU platforms remains limited because different hardware architectures require specialized quantum simulation frameworks, each with distinct implementations and optimization strategies. Therefore, we introduce Q-Gear, a software framework that transforms Qiskit quantum circuits into Cuda-Q kernels. By leveraging Cuda-Q seamless execution on GPUs, Q-Gear accelerates both CPU and GPU based simulations by respectively two orders of magnitude and ten times with minimal coding effort. Furthermore, Q-Gear leverages Cuda-Q configuration to interconnect GPUs memory allowing the execution of much larger circuits, beyond the memory limit set by a single GPU or CPU node. Additionally, we created and deployed a Podman container and a Shifter image at Perlmutter (NERSC/LBNL), both derived from NVIDIA public image. These public NERSC containers were optimized for the Slurm job scheduler allowing for close to 100% GPU utilization. We present various benchmarks of the Q-Gear to prove the efficiency of our computation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Direct entanglement ansatz learning (DEAL) with ZNE on error-prone superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum combinatorial optimization algorithms typically face challenges due to complex optimization landscapes featuring numerous local minima, exponentially scaling latent spaces, and susceptibility to quantum hardware noise. In this study, we introduce Direct Entanglement Ansatz Learning (DEAL), wherein we employ a direct mapping from quadratic unconstrained binary problem parameters to quantum ansatz angles for cost and mixer hamiltonians, which improves the convergence rate towards the optimal solution. Our approach exploits a quantum entanglement-based ansatz to effectively explore intricate latent spaces and zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) to greatly mitigate the randomness caused by crosstalk and coherence errors. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DEAL increases the success rate by up to 14% compared to the classic quantum approximation optimization algorithm while also controlling the error variance. In addition, we demonstrate the capability of DEAL to provide near optimum ground energy solutions for travelling salesman, knapsack, and maxcut problems, which facilitates novel paradigms for solving relevant NP-hard problems and extends the practical applicability of quantum optimization using noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Authenticated Sublinear Quantum Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel lower bound on communication complexity using quantum relative entropy and mutual information, refining previous classical entropy-based results. By leveraging Uhlmann's lemma and quantum Pinsker inequalities, the authors establish tighter bounds for information-theoretic security, demonstrating that quantum protocols inherently outperform classical counterparts in balancing privacy and efficiency. Also explores symmetric Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) protocols that achieve sub-linear communication complexity while ensuring robustness against specious adversaries: A post-quantum cryptography based protocol that can be authenticated for the specious server; A ring-LWE-based protocol for post-quantum security in a single-server setting, ensuring robustness against quantum attacks; A multi-server protocol optimized for hardware practicality, reducing implementation overhead while maintaining sub-linear efficiency. These protocols address critical gaps in secure database queries, offering exponential communication improvements over classical linear-complexity methods. The work also analyzes security trade-offs under quantum specious adversaries, providing theoretical guarantees for privacy and correctness.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chernoff concentration bounds for multipartite soft covering and expander walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Chernoff style exponential concentration bounds for classical quantum soft covering generalising previous works which gave bounds only in expectation. Our first result is an exponential concentration bound for fully smooth multipartite classical quantum soft covering, extending Ahlswede-Winter's seminal result in several important directions. Next, we prove a new exponential concentration result for smooth unipartite classical quantum soft covering when the samples are taken via a random walk on an expander graph. The resulting expander matrix Chernoff bound complements the results of Garg, Lee, Song and Srivastava in important ways. We prove our new expander matrix Chernoff bound by generalising McDiarmid's method of bounded differences for functions of independent random variables to a new method of bounded excision for functions of expander walks. This new technical tool should be of independent interest.
  A notable feature of our new concentration bounds is that they have no explicit Hilbert space dimension factor. This is because our bounds are stated in terms of the trace distance of the sample averaged quantum state to the `ideal' quantum state. Our bounds are sensitive to certain smooth Renyi max divergences, giving a clear handle on the number of samples required to achieve a target trace distance. Using these novel features, we prove new one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over different kinds of quantum wiretap channels with many non-interacting eavesdroppers that are independent of the Hilbert space dimensions of the eavesdroppers. Such powerful results were unknown earlier even in the fully classical setting.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Channels of the Compton Scattering of an Entangled Pair of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Compton scattering of an entangled pair of photons as an example, we demonstrate the process of deriving the Kraus operators corresponding to the interaction from the underlying fundamental theory, quantum electrodynamics. The normalization of the final density matrix of the entangled photons after the interaction is crucial to obtaining the correct correlations. The reduced density matrix of the photon, which does not participate in the interaction directly, remains unchanged. It indicates that quantum effects, using an entangled pair of photons for quantum sensing, can only be observed via the correlations or superposition of the complete entangled pair of photons.</description>

      <title>Tunneling time in non-Hermitian space fractional quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tunneling time of a wave packet propagating through a non-Hermitian potential $V_{r} - iV_{i}$ in space-fractional quantum mechanics. By applying the stationary phase method, we derive a closed-form expression for the tunneling time for this system. This study presents the first investigation of tunneling time at the interplay of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and space-fractional quantum mechanics. The variation in tunneling time as the system transitions from a real to a complex potential is analyzed. We demonstrate that the tunneling time exhibits a dependence on the barrier width $d$ in the limit $d\rightarrow \infty$, showing the absence of the Hartman effect. A particularly striking feature of our findings is the potential manifestation of the Hartman effect for a specific combination of the absorption component $V_{i}$ and the Levy index $\alpha$. This behavior arises from the fact that the presence of the absorption component $V_{i}$ leads to a monotonic increase in tunneling time with barrier thickness, whereas the Levy index $\alpha$ reduces the tunneling time. The interplay of these contrasting influences facilitates the emergence of the Hartman effect under a specific combination of $V_{i}$ and the fractional parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase classification via quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase classification is a fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics, traditionally approached using order parameters or quantum machine learning techniques such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs). However, these methods often require extensive prior knowledge of the system or large numbers of quantum state copies for reliable classification. In this work, we propose a classification algorithm based on the quantum Neyman-Pearson test, which is theoretically optimal for distinguishing between two quantum states. While directly constructing the quantum Neyman-Pearson test for many-body systems via full state tomography is intractable due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, we introduce a partitioning strategy that applies hypothesis tests to subsystems rather than the entire state, effectively reducing the required number of quantum state copies while maintaining classification accuracy. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating its advantages over conventional methods, including the order parameter-based classifier and the QCNN. Our results show that the proposed method achieves lower classification error probabilities and significantly reduces the training cost compared to the QCNN and the recently developed classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data, while maintaining high scalability up to systems with 81 qubits.

      <title>CutQAS: Topology-aware quantum circuit cutting via reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating molecular systems on quantum processors has the potential to surpass classical methods in computational resource efficiency. The limited qubit connectivity, small processor size, and short coherence times of near-term quantum hardware constrain the applicability of quantum algorithms like QPE and VQE. Quantum circuit cutting mitigates these constraints by partitioning large circuits into smaller subcircuits, enabling execution on resource-limited devices. However, finding optimal circuit partitions remains a significant challenge, affecting both computational efficiency and accuracy. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose CutQAS, a novel framework that integrates quantum circuit cutting with quantum architecture search (QAS) to enhance quantum chemistry simulations. Our framework employs a multi-step reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize circuit configurations. First, an RL agent explores all possible topologies to identify an optimal circuit structure. Subsequently, a second RL agent refines the selected topology by determining optimal circuit cuts, ensuring efficient execution on constrained hardware. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving simulation accuracy and resource efficiency. This approach presents a scalable solution for quantum chemistry applications, offering a systematic pathway to overcoming hardware constraints in near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum parallel information exchange (QPIE) hybrid network with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as an innovative framework with the potential to uncover complex patterns by leveraging quantum systems ability to simulate and exploit high-dimensional latent spaces, particularly in learning tasks. Quantum neural network (QNN) frameworks are inherently sensitive to the precision of gradient calculations and the computational limitations of current quantum hardware as unitary rotations introduce overhead from complex number computations, and the quantum gate operation speed remains a bottleneck for practical implementations. In this study, we introduce quantum parallel information exchange (QPIE) hybrid network, a new non-sequential hybrid classical quantum model architecture, leveraging quantum transfer learning by feeding pre-trained parameters from classical neural networks into quantum circuits, which enables efficient pattern recognition and temporal series data prediction by utilizing non-clifford parameterized quantum gates thereby enhancing both learning efficiency and representational capacity. Additionally, we develop a dynamic gradient selection method that applies the parameter shift rule on quantum processing units (QPUs) and adjoint differentiation on GPUs. Our results demonstrate model performance exhibiting higher accuracy in ad-hoc benchmarks, lowering approximately 88% convergence rate for extra stochasticity time-series data within 100-steps, and showcasing a more unbaised eigenvalue spectrum of the fisher information matrix on CPU/GPU and IonQ QPU simulators.</description>

      <title>Impact of Error Rate Misreporting on Resource Allocation in Multi-tenant Quantum Computing and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based quantum service providers allow multiple users to run programs on shared hardware concurrently to maximize resource utilization and minimize operational costs. This multi-tenant computing (MTC) model relies on the error parameters of the hardware for fair qubit allocation and scheduling, as error-prone qubits can degrade computational accuracy asymmetrically for users sharing the hardware. To maintain low error rates, quantum providers perform periodic hardware calibration, often relying on third-party calibration services. If an adversary within this calibration service misreports error rates, the allocator can be misled into making suboptimal decisions even when the physical hardware remains unchanged. We demonstrate such an attack model in which an adversary strategically misreports qubit error rates to reduce hardware throughput, and probability of successful trial (PST) for two previously proposed allocation frameworks, i.e. Greedy and Community-Based Dynamic Allocation Partitioning (COMDAP). Experimental results show that adversarial misreporting increases execution latency by 24% and reduces PST by 7.8%. We also propose to identify inconsistencies in reported error rates by analyzing statistical deviations in error rates across calibration cycles.</description>

      <title>Micro-Oscillation Frequency Estimation of an Optical Point Source Using Spatial Mode Demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution array detectors are widely used in single-particle tracking, but their performance is limited by excess noise from background light and dark current. As pixel resolution increases, the diminished signal per pixel exacerbates susceptibility to noise, degrading tracking accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a noise-robust approach for estimating the motion characteristics of an optical point-like source. Utilizing quantum estimation theory, we show that SPADE efficiently concentrate the point source's positional information into a few key spatial modes, drastically reducing the number of detectors needed while maintaining high estimation precision. We further demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a SPADE with two elaborately designed modes outperforms direct imaging in estimating the micro-oscillation frequency of an optical point source in the presence of background noise.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Transverse Deflection Measurement with Two-photon Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is an intrinsic quantum phenomena that goes beyond the possibilities of classical physics, and enables various applications in quantum metrology. While the timing resolution of HOM-based sensor is generally investigated, the ultimate quantum sensitivity in the estimation of transverse deflection or displacement between paired photons interfering at a balanced beam splitter has been explored relatively little. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a spatial HOM interferometry for measuring the transverse deflection of an optical beam by using transverse momentum sampling measurements. This feasible scheme suffices to achieve great precision with comparatively little technological effort, which circumvents the stringent requirement in direct imaging resolution at the diffraction limit. We can adaptively determine optimum working points using a Fisher information analysis, and demonstrate an optimized spatial HOM interferometry according to practical applications. These results may significantly facilitate the use of quantum interference for high precision spatial sensing, and pave the way to more complex quantum imaging techniques like nanoscopic microscopy.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of quantum interferences in CO-H$_2$ rotational energy transfer at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using time-resolved infrared-vacuum-ultraviolet double-resonance spectroscopy, experimental room temperature measurements of state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer within the X $^1\Sigma^+(v=2)$ vibrational state of CO due to H$_2$ collisions have been compared to accurate 4-D close-coupling quantum calculations. Theoretically predicted quantum interferences in the CO-H$_2$ collisional system are experimentally observed for the first time at room temperature, and excellent agreement between theory and experiment is observed. These results provide a valuable benchmark for validating the anisotropic part of the potential energy surface, thereby supporting the theoretical modeling of CO emission in warm astrophysical environments such as photodissociation regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hardware-efficient approach to prepare single mode travelling wave packets in non-Gaussian bosonic states with a superconducting circuit platform. Such states enable secure deterministic quantum communication between distant quantum processor units. Rather than first producing the non-Gaussian states in a cavity mode by a nonlinear process and subsequently releasing it to a waveguide, we propose and analyze a scheme that applies a combination of linear and nonlinear interactions and losses to form and emit the states in wave packets, controlled by the coherent excitation of the system. The system is subject to a non-linear anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian of high order due to losses of lower order, and our proposal enables efficient and deterministic creation of propagating two- and four-component cat states, grid states, and entangled pair-cat states.</description>

      <title>Impact of Absorption due to Zero-Field Splitting on Loss in Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence times of superconducting qubits are limited by loss mechanisms, whose microscopic origins have remained elusive. We propose a mechanism caused by transitions between zero-fieldsplit states of paramagnetic impurities or defects. We derive the absorption cross section for a magnetic dipole transition and apply it to calculate the loss tangent. For Cr, Fe, and V impurities in sapphire, we find loss tangents at 4.5 GHz in the range of 10$^{-9}$-10$^{-8}$, comparable to the loss measured in experiments. This value suggests that magnetic loss may be a limiting factor in the coherence times of superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We describe our investigations involving the sonification of data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled to close to their quantum ground states, as well as the sonification of measured data from a single qubit subject to various unitary rotations designed to test the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening" to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the qubit experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</description>

      <title>Hybrid and scalable photonic circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), the development of a photonic analog--specifically, photonic circuit cQED--has become a major focus in integrated quantum photonics. Current solid-state cQED devices, however, face scalability challenges due to the difficulty in simultaneously spectral tuning of cavity modes and quantum emitters while ensuring in-plane optical modes confinement for efficient on-chip light routing. Here, we overcome these limitations by proposing and demonstrating a hybrid solid-state cQED platform integrated on a chip. Our device integrates semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) with a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) microring resonator. Leveraging TFLN's ferroelectric and electro-optic (EO) properties, we implement local spectral tuning of both waveguide-coupled QDs and cavity modes. This approach achieves a broad spectral tuning range of up to 4.82 nm for individual QDs, enabling deterministic on-chip single-photon emission with a Purcell factor of 3.52. When combined with EO cavity tuning, we realize a spectrally tunable hybrid photonic circuit cQED device, sustaining near-constant Purcell factors of 1.89 over a 0.30 nm spectral range. This achievement enables scalable on-chip cavity-enhanced single-photon sources while preserving optical properties and maintaining compatibility with advanced photonic architectures, marking a significant step toward practical implementation of large-scale chip-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Theory of Symmetry-Protected Two-Photon Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 033601 (2024)], the coherence time of degenerate entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated via backward spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cold atomic ensemble was shown to be immune to optical loss and dephasing. This finding is crucial for practical applications in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and networking, where loss is inevitable. However, the underlying mechanism for this loss- and dephasing-insensitive biphoton coherence time was insufficiently studied in the previous article, as quantum noise was not taken into account. In this work, we employ the Heisenberg-Langevin approach to study this effect and provide a rigorous theoretical proof of the symmetry-protected biphoton coherence by taking quantum noise into consideration, as compared to the perturbation theory in the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Incompatibility in Parallel vs Antiparallel Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the joint measurability of incompatible quantum observables on ensembles of parallel and antiparallel spin pairs. In parallel configuration, two systems are identically prepared, whereas in antiparallel configuration each system is paired with its spin-flipped counterpart. We demonstrate that the antiparallel configuration enables exact simultaneous prediction of three mutually orthogonal spin components -- an advantage unattainable in the parallel case. As we show, this enhanced measurement compatibility in antiparallel configuration is better explained within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories, which allow a broader class of composite structures while preserving quantum descriptions at the subsystem level. Furthermore, this approach extends the study of measurement incompatibility to more general configurations beyond just the parallel and antiparallel cases, providing deeper insights into the boundary between physical and unphysical quantum state evolutions. To this end, we discuss how the enhanced measurement compatibility in antiparallel configuration can be observed on a finite ensemble of qubit states, paving the way for an experimental demonstration of this advantage.</description>

      <title>Scalable simulation of random quantum circuits using projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We use the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge to simulate the states of random quantum circuits (RQCs), which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, our PEPS simulation is exact for circuit depths less than $D_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by performing large-scale simulations for $n \leq 10^{4}$ or $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has computational cost scaling polynomially with $n$ for circuit depth $D =O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state (MPS) approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms, with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.</description>

      <title>Unified speed limits in classical and quantum dynamics via temporal Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of Fisher information is increasing in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, as it has played a fundamental role in trade-off relations such as thermodynamic uncertainty relations and speed limits. In this work, we investigate temporal Fisher information, which measures the temporal information content encoded in probability distributions, for both classical and quantum systems. We establish that temporal Fisher information is bounded from above by physical costs, such as entropy production in classical Langevin and Markov processes, and the variance of interaction Hamiltonians in open quantum systems. Conversely, temporal Fisher information is bounded from below by statistical distances (e.g., the Bhattacharyya arccos distance), leading to classical and quantum speed limits that constrain the minimal time required for state transformations. Our work provides a unified perspective of speed limits from the point of view of temporal Fisher information in both classical and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Markov Gap and Bound Entanglement in Haar Random State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound entanglement refers to entangled states that cannot be distilled into maximally entangled states, thus cannot be used directly in many protocols of quantum information processing. We identify a relationship between bound entanglement and Markov gap, which is introduced in holography from the entanglement wedge cross-section, and is related to the fidelity of Markov recovery problem. We prove that the bound entanglement must have non-zero Markov gap, and conversely, the state with weakly non-zero Markov gap almost surely, with respect to Haar measure, has an entanglement undistillable, i.e. bound entangled or separable, marginal state for sufficiently large system. Moreover, we show that the bound entanglement and the threshold for separability in Haar random state is originated from the state with weakly non-zero Markov gap, which supports the non-perturbative effects from holographic perspective. Our results shed light on the investigation of Markov gap, and enhance the interdisciplinary application of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Fast gates for bit-flip protected superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits offer an unprecedentedly high degree of flexibility in terms of circuit encoding and parameter choices. However, in designing the qubit parameters one typically faces the conflicting goals of long coherence times and simple control capabilities. Both are determined by the wavefunction overlap of the qubit basis states and the corresponding matrix elements. Here, we address this problem by introducing a qubit architecture with real-time tunable bit-flip protection. In the first, the `heavy' regime, the energy relaxation time can be on the order of hours for fluxons located in two near-degenerate ground states, as recently demonstrated in Ref. [Hassani et al., Nat.~Commun.~14 (2023)]. The second, `light' regime, on the other hand facilitates high-fidelity control on nanosecond timescales without the need for microwave signals. We propose two different tuning mechanisms of the qubit potential and show that base-band flux-pulses of around 10 ns are sufficient to realize a universal set of high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We expect that the concept of real-time wavefunction control can also be applied to other hardware-protected qubit designs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Phase Gates as Airy Transforms of the Wigner Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-order nonlinear phase gates allow the construction of versatile higher-order nonlinearities for bosonic systems and grant access to continuous variable quantum simulations of many unexplored aspects of nonlinear quantum dynamics. The resulting nonlinear transformations produce, even with small strength, multiple regions of negativity in the Wigner function and thus show an immediate departure from classical phase space. Towards the development of realistic, bounded versions of these gates we show that the action of a quartic-bounded cubic gate on an arbitrary multimode quantum state in phase space can be understood as an Airy transform of the Wigner function. This toolbox generalises the symplectic transformations associated with Gaussian operations and allows for the practical calculation, analysis and interpretation of explicit Wigner functions and the quantum non-Gaussian phenomena resulting from bounded nonlinear potentials.</description>

      <title>Approach to optimal quantum transport via states over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach the problem of constructing a quantum analogue of the immensely fruitful classical transport cost theory of Monge from a new angle. Going back to the original motivations, by which the transport is a bilinear function of a mass distribution (without loss of generality a probability density) and a transport plan (a stochastic kernel), we explore the quantum version where the mass distribution is generalised to a density matrix, and the transport plan to a completely positive and trace preserving map.
  These two data are naturally integrated into their Jordan product, which is called state over time (``stote''), and the transport cost is postulated to be a linear function of it.
  We explore the properties of this transport cost, as well as the optimal transport cost between two given states (simply the minimum cost over all suitable transport plans). After that, we analyse in considerable detail the case of unitary invariant cost, for which we can calculate many costs analytically. These findings suggest that our quantum transport cost is qualitatively different from Monge's classical transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geometric aspects of the space of densities by analyzing transport along paths generated by quantum Markovian semigroups and more generally locally Markovian, or time-dependent Lindbladian, dynamics. Motivated by practical constraints, we also consider a more realistic scenario in which only a restricted set of Lindbladian generators is available. We study the corresponding transitivity properties and characterize the set of states that can be reached using such limited dynamical resources.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>

      <title>Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient for Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most prominent algorithms using near-term quantum devices, designed to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian. In VQE, a classical optimizer iteratively updates the parameters in the quantum circuit. Among various optimization methods, quantum natural gradient descent (QNG) stands out as a promising optimization approach for VQE. However, standard QNG only leverages the quantum Fisher information of the entire system and treats each subsystem equally in the optimization process, without accounting for the different weights and contributions of each subsystem corresponding to each observable. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Approximate Quantum Natural Gradient (WA-QNG) method tailored for $k$-local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the potential advantages of WA-QNG compared to QNG from three distinct perspectives and reveal its connection with the Gauss-Newton method. We also show it outperforms standard quantum natural gradient descent in the numerical experiments for seeking the ground state of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Deformation of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra and the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$: exact solution for the quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new deformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator Heisenberg-Weyl algebra with a parameter $a&gt;-1$. This parameter is introduced through the replacement of the homogeneous mass $m_0$ in the definition of the momentum operator $\hat p_x$ as well as in the creation-annihilation operators $\hat a^\pm$ with a mass varying with position $x$. The realization of such a deformation is shown through the exact solution of the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation for the non-relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator within the canonical approach. The obtained analytical expression of the energy spectrum consists of an infinite number of equidistant levels, whereas the wavefunctions of the stationary states of the problem under construction are expressed through the Hermite polynomials. Then, the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra deformation is generalized to the case of the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}\left( {1|2} \right)$. It is shown that the realization of such a generalized superalgebra can be performed for the parabose quantum harmonic oscillator problem, the mass of which possesses a behavior completely overlapping with the position-dependent mass of the canonically deformed harmonic oscillator problem. This problem is solved exactly for both even and odd stationary states. It is shown that the energy spectrum of the deformed parabose oscillator is still equidistant, however, both even and odd state wavefunctions are now expressed through the Laguerre polynomials. Some basic limit relations recovering the canonical harmonic oscillator with constant mass are also discussed briefly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion traps are used for a wide range of applications from metrology to quantum simulations and quantum information processing. Microfabricated chip-based 3D ion traps are scalable to store many ions for the realization of a large number of qubits, provide deep trapping potentials compared to surface traps, and very good shielding from external electric fields. In this work, we give an overview of our recent developments on chip-based 3D ion traps. Different types of chip materials, the integration of electronic filter components on-chip and compact electrical connections in vacuum are discussed. Further, based on finite element method (FEM) simulations, we discuss how integrating micro-optics in 3D ion traps is possible without disturbing the trapped ions.</description>

      <title>An all optical broadband tunable quantum frequency shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A frequency shifter of the photon is a key component for frequency-multiplexed high-capacity quantum communications and frequency-encoded quantum computation. Existed methods for shifting the frequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect, however, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz, furthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of a photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the frequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is usually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between these methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter based on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a frequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a principle of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading process, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and the shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency difference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence ratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the preserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in analog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning ability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental building block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency domain photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk with coherent multiple translations induces fast quantum gate operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks with one-dimensional translational symmetry are important for quantum algorithms, where the speed-up of the diffusion speed can be reached if long-range couplings are added. Our work studies a scheme of a ring under the strong resonant modulation that can support discrete-time quantum walk including coherent multiple long-range translations in a natural way along synthetic frequency dimension. These multiple translation paths are added in a coherent way, which makes the walker evolve under the topological band. Therein, not only the fast diffusion speed is expected, but more importantly, we find that single quantum gate operations can be performed in the quasi-momentum space. In particular, we show the arbitrary single-qubit state preparation and an example of CNOT two-qubit gate with only one time step, dramarically increasing quantum algorithms. Our study uses a single ring to provide fast quantum gate operations based on coherent multiple path quantum walk, which may provide unique designs for efficient quantum operations on photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Entangling two Rydberg Superatoms via Heralded Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heralded storage of photons is crucial for advancing quantum networks. Previous realizations have primarily relied on single atoms strongly coupled to optical cavities. In this work, we present the experimental realization of heralded storage using a Rydberg superatom, a mesoscopic atomic ensemble operating in the strong blockade regime. In our approach, an input photon is initially stored in the superatom via electromagnetically induced transparency. Subsequently, a second photon is emitted conditioned on the success of the first photon's storage. Due to the collectively enhanced interaction, both the storage and the emission of the herald photon can be rather efficient in principle. As a demonstration of this technique, we use it to entangle two remote Rydberg superatoms. This method obviates the need for an intermediate node, which is commonly employed in traditional interference-based remote entanglement schemes. Our results showcase the potential of performing cavity-QED-like experiments with Rydberg superatoms. This work opens pathways for numerous applications in quantum networks and linear optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Topological transition between gapless phases in quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological gapless phases of matter have been a recent interest among theoretical and experimental condensed matter physicists. Fermionic chains with extended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique topological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless phases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the transition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a three-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless phases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with their distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based on the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the quantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains, such as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function, can be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow and Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the multicritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and overlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points of the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore, we categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using the group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological characters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which allows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions at the multicritical points.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of Threshold Quantum State Tomography on a fully-reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the state of a complex quantum system represents a pivotal task for all quantum information applications, both for characterization purposes and for verification of quantum protocols. Recent technological developments have shown the capability of building quantum systems with progressively larger number of qubits in different platforms. The standard approach based on quantum state tomography, while providing a method to completely characterize an unknown quantum state, requires a number of measurements that scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Other methods have been subsequently proposed and tested to reduce the number of measurements, or to focus on specific properties of the output state rather than on its complete reconstruction. Here, we show experimentally the application of an approach, called threshold quantum state tomography, in an advanced hybrid photonic platform with states up to n=4 qubits. This method does not require a priori knowledge on the state, and selects only the informative projectors starting from the measurement of the density matrix diagonal. We show the effectiveness of this approach in a photonic platform, showing that a consistent reduction in the number of measurement is obtained while reconstructing relevant states for quantum protocols, with only very limited loss of information. The advantage of this protocol opens perspective of its application in larger, more complex, systems.</description>

      <title>Online Gaussian elimination for quantum LDPC decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoders for quantum LDPC codes generally rely on solving a parity-check equation with Gaussian elimination, with the generalised union-find decoder performing this repeatedly on growing clusters. We present an online variant of the Gaussian elimination algorithm which maintains an LUP decomposition in order to process only new rows and columns as they are added to a system of equations. This is equivalent to performing Gaussian elimination once on the final system of equations, in contrast to the multiple rounds of Gaussian elimination employed by the generalised union-find decoder. It thus significantly reduces the number of operations performed by the decoder. We consider the generalised union-find decoder as an example use case and present a complexity analysis demonstrating that both variants take time cubic in the number of qubits in the general case, but that the number of operations performed by the online variant is lower by an amount which itself scales cubically. This analysis is also extended to the regime of 'well-behaved' codes in which the number of growth iterations required is bounded logarithmically in error weight. Finally, we show empirically that our online variant outperforms the original offline decoder in average-case time complexity on codes with sparser parity-check matrices or greater covering radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how entanglement in photoionization is transferred from an electron-ion pair to an electron-photon pair by fluorescence. Time-resolved von Neumann entropies are used to establish how information is shared between the particles. Multipartite entanglement, between electron, ion and photon, is found on intermediate timescales. Finally, it is shown how a phase-locked two-pulse sequence allows for the application of time symmetry, mediated by strong coupling, to reveal the entanglement transfer process by measuring the photon number and electron kinetic energy in coincidence.</description>

      <title>All-to-all connectivity of Rydberg-atom-based quantum processors with messenger qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays is a promising platform for programmable quantum simulators and universal quantum processors. A major challenge threatening the scalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the finite range of interactions between atoms. We discuss an approach to realize dynamical all-to-all connectivity between qubits with the use of moving atoms, which we referred to as messenger qubits, that interact with the computational qubits of the processor. We propose four specific architectures capitalizing on this idea and compare them one to another, as well as to alternative approaches. We argue that the use of messenger qubits, while posing new technological challenges, promises further development of the Rydberg-atom-based platform.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum-enhanced interferometry with general Markovian light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optical systems comprising quantum emitters interacting with engineered optical modes generate non-classical states of light that can be used as resource states for quantum-enhanced interferometry. However, outside of well-controlled systems producing either single-mode states (e.g. Fock states or squeezed states) or highly symmetric multi-mode states (e.g. superradiant states), their potential for quantum advantage remains uncharacterized. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum enhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we show how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted by a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without explicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this relationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and spectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry. Finally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve this quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In particular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can always be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source. Simultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics and photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.</description>

      <title>Control and Transient Spectroscopy of Engineered Spin-Cavity Back-Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental arrangement that permits engineering of cavity back-action on a mesoscopic spin ensemble. By coupling a superconducting thin-film Nb microstrip resonator to a Trityl OX63 electron spin sample, we access different regimes of spin-cavity dynamics by designing the ensemble size, effective coupling strength, cavity temperature, and spin saturation. We performed transient spectroscopy measurements under continuous microwave drive in the strong radiation damping regime. These measurements exhibit a long-lived plateau response that distinguishes important features of spin-cavity models, such as the radiation damping Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations. We demonstrate control of the plateau response through adjustment of temperature, microwave drive power, and variable spin saturation. The presented experimental arrangement serves as a robust system to explore the space of spin-cavity dynamics and develop new quantum devices that harness the complexity of mesoscopic spin ensembles coherently interacting with high quality factor cavities.</description>

      <title>Measuring R\'enyi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <title>Spectral correlations of dynamical Resonance Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-filtered photon correlations have been proven to be extremely useful in grasping how the detection process alters photon statistics. Harnessing the spectral correlations also permits refinement of the emission and unraveling of previously hidden strong correlations in a plethora of quantum-optical systems under continuous-wave excitation. In this work, we investigate such correlations for time-dependent excitation and develop a methodology to compute efficiently time-integrated correlations, which are at the heart of the photon-counting theory, and subsequently apply it to analyze the photon emission of pulsed systems. By combining this formalism with the sensor method -- which facilitates frequency-resolved correlations -- we demonstrate how spectral filtering enhances single-photon purity and suppresses multi-photon noise in time-bin-encoded quantum states. Specifically, filtering the central spectral peak of a dynamically driven two-level system boosts temporal coherence and improves the fidelity of time-bin entanglement preparation, even under conditions favoring multi-photon emission. These results establish spectral filtering as a critical tool for tailoring photon statistics in pulsed quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Singlet Lifetime and Photoexcitation Behavior of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05289v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active electronic spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a promising platform for quantum sensing, as they can enable shorter standoff distances compared to defects in diamond, leading to sensitivity advantages. Perhaps the most studied defect in a vdW material is the negatively charged boron vacancy center ($V^{-}_{B}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, many of the $V^{-}_{B}$ electronic and spin transition rates and branching ratios are not fully known. Here, we use time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements with a nanosecond rise-time 515 nm laser to determine directly the singlet state lifetime of a $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in neutron-irradiated, sub-micron-size flakes of hBN. We perform this measurement on 16 different hBN flakes at room temperature and obtain an average lifetime of 15(3) ns. Additionally, we probe the PL dynamics of thermal and optically polarized electronic spin distributions of the $V^{-}_{B}$ ensemble in a single sub-micron hBN flake, and fit our results to a 9-level model to extract the electronic transition rates. Lastly, we present PL measurements that potentially indicate optically-induced conversion of $V^{-}_{B}$ to another electronic state, or possibly the neutral charge state (V$^{0}_{B}$), in neutron-irradiated hBN flakes of size $&gt;$ 1 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic field, entropy of an ideal monoatomic gas, and the birth of Bose-Einstein statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript in the mail from the Indian physicist S.N. Bose. He quickly translated Bose's manuscript to German and submitted it to Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik. Within a few weeks, Einstein presented his own findings (using a generalization of Bose's counting method) to a session of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Whereas Bose had suggested a new counting method for the quanta of the electromagnetic field -- one that yielded Planck's blackbody radiation formula -- Einstein applied Bose's method to an ideal monoatomic gas. Shortly afterward, Einstein presented to the Academy a follow-up paper in which he described the Bose-Einstein condensation for the first time. The present paper describes some of the fascinating issues that Einstein struggled with as he attempted to unify the quantum-statistical properties of matter with those of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Local-density correlation functional from the force-balance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The force-balance equation of time-dependent density-functional theory presents a promising route towards obtaining approximate functionals, however, so far, no practical correlation functionals have been derived this way. In this work, starting from a correlated wavefunction proposed originally by Colle and Salvetti [Theoret. Chim. Acta 37, 329 (1975)], we derive an analytical correlation-energy functional for the ground state based on the force-balance equation. The new functional is compared to the local-density correlation of the homogeneous electron gas and we find an increased performance for atomic systems, while it performs slightly worse on solids. From this point onward, the new force-based correlation functional can be systematically improved.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of $H\to VV^*$: precise predictions in the SM and sensitivity to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons $(H\to VV^*\to 4f)$. In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs $(H\to ZZ^*\to \mu^+\mu^- e^+ e^-)$. We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases and significantly alter the extraction of the observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify the observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Multilayer Graphene Coupled to a Chiral Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. In bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Furthermore, we show that a chiral cavity breaks not only the time-reversal symmetry of bilayer graphene but also the inversion symmetry, which impacts its edge spectrum. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It seems self-evident that a density functional calculation should be normalized to the number of electrons in the system. We present multiple examples where the accuracy of the approximate energy is improved (sometimes greatly) by violating this basic principle. In one dimension, we explicitly derive the appropriate correction to the normalization. Beyond one dimension, Weyl asymptotics for energy levels yield these corrections for any cavity. We include examples with Coulomb potentials and the exchange energy of atoms to illustrate relevance to realistic calculations.</description>

Abstract: The SU$(1,1)$ group plays a fundamental role in various areas of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum optics, and representation theory. In this work we revisit the holomorphic discrete series representations of SU$(1,1)$, with a focus on orthogonality relations for matrix elements, character formulas of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs), and the decomposition of tensor products of these UIRs. Special attention is given to the structure of these decompositions and the associated multiplicities, which are essential for understanding composite systems and interactions within SU$(1,1)$ symmetry frameworks. These findings offer deeper insights into the mathematical foundations of SU$(1,1)$ representations and their significance in theoretical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ linearized quantum gravity to show that gravitational redshift occurs as a purely quantum process. To achieve our goal we study the interaction between propagating photonic wave-packets and gravitons. Crucially, the redshift occurs as predicted by general relativity but arises in flat spacetime in the absence of curvature. In particular, redshift as a classical gravitational effect can be understood as a mean-field process where an effective interaction occurs between the photon and gravitons in an effective highly-populated coherent state. These results can help improve our understanding of the quantum nature of gravity in the low energy and low curvature regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) harness the wave nature of light to achieve unparalleled speed and energy efficiency for artificial intelligence tasks, outperforming their electronic counterparts. Despite their potential, the development of deep AONNs is constrained by the high optical power demands of conventional nonlinear optical processes, which limits scalability. This work introduces a novel low-power nonlinear optical activation function scheme based on a three-level quantum medium driven by two laser fields. Unlike traditional single-input, single-output activations, our design offers two-port optical nonlinear activation functions with both self- and cross-nonlinearities, making them great candidates for multi-input, multi-output networks. The approach allows precise control of nonlinear optical behavior, achieving sigmoid and rectified linear unit (ReLU)functions at ultralow power levels (~ 17 uW per neuron). Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constructing large-scale, deep AONNs with millions of neurons powered by less than 100 W of optical power. This advancement represents a significant step toward scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient AONNs for next-generation AI hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics in the Hatano-Nelson model with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is the accumulation of eigenstates at the boundaries, reflecting the system's nonreciprocity. Introducing disorder leads to a competition between the skin effect and Anderson localization, giving rise to the skin-Anderson transition. Here, we investigate wave packet spreading in the disordered Hatano-Nelson model and uncover distinct dynamical behaviors across different regimes. In the clean limit, transport is unidirectionally ballistic ({\Delta}x ~ t) due to nonreciprocity. For weak disorder, where skin and Anderson-localized modes coexist, transport transitions from ballistic at early times to superdiffusive ({\Delta}x ~ t^{2/3}) at long times. In the deeply Anderson-localized regime, initial diffusion ({\Delta}x ~ t^{1/2}) eventually gives way to superdiffusive spreading. We examine how these scaling behaviors emerge from the system's spectral properties and eigenstate localization behaviors. Our work unveils the rich dynamics driven by nonreciprocity and disorder in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>All-vortex nonlinear Compton scattering in a polarized laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of all-vortex nonlinear Compton scattering in an intense and polarized laser field, in which the initial and final electrons and the emitted $\gamma$ photon are all in vortex states, is studied theoretically. We develop a formalism for the process, which allows us to study the exchanges of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum among the electron, $\gamma$ photon, and laser. A wave packet of the Bessel-Gaussian type is adopted to describe the initial vortex electron for the purpose of normalization. Both circularly and linearly polarized lasers are examined. Substantial numerical calculations are performed to reveal the physics of the exchanges of the OAM and spin angular momentum. The strong impact of the laser intensity and the opening angle of the initial vortex electron is demonstrated. Our results also suggest possible scenarios for the separation of the emitted $\gamma$ photons with different OAMs, as well as a possible way which could help to distinguish the OAM and spin of the vortex particle by the multi-peak structure in the spectrum of the emitted photon.</description>

      <title>Pruned-ADAPT-VQE: compacting molecular ans\"atze by removing irrelevant operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is one of the most widely used algorithms for electronic structure calculations. It adaptively selects operators based on their gradient, constructing ans\"atze that continuously evolve to match the energy landscape, helping avoid local traps and barren plateaus. However, this flexibility in reoptimization can lead to the inclusion of redundant or inefficient operators that have almost zero amplitude, barely contributing to the ansatz. We identify three phenomena responsible for the appearance of these operators: poor operator selection, operator reordering, and fading operators. In this work, we propose an automated, cost-free refinement method that removes unnecessary operators from the ansatz without disrupting convergence. Our approach evaluates each operator after ADAPT-VQE optimization by using a function that considers both its amplitude and position in the ansatz, striking a balance between eliminating low-amplitude operators while preserving the natural reduction of coefficients as the ansatz grows. Additionally, a dynamic threshold based on the amplitudes of recent operators enables efficient convergence. We apply this method to several molecular systems and find that it reduces ansatz size and accelerates convergence, particularly in cases with flat energy landscapes. The refinement process incurs no additional computational cost and consistently improves or maintains ADAPT-VQE performance.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence in non-chiral non-unitary quantum dynamics of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral symmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in determining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological invariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The corresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs to be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system with chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we experimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall structure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The appearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced non-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally builds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle for studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic imaginary-time evolution in state-vector-based and shot-based simulations and on quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution, an important technique in tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms on classical computers, has recently been adapted to quantum computing. In this study, we focus on probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) algorithm and derive its formulation in the context of state-vector-based simulations, where quantum state vectors are directly used to compute observables without statistical errors. We compare the results with those of shot-based simulations, which estimate observables through repeated projective measurements. Applying the PITE algorithm to the Heisenberg chain, we investigate optimal initial conditions for convergence. We further demonstrate the method on the transverse-field Ising model using a state-of-the-art trapped-ion quantum device. Finally, we explore the potential of error mitigation in this framework, highlighting practical considerations for near-term digital quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Combining kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of generic currents in multi-terminal, multi-channel quantum transport settings. In the quantum regime, these fluctuations and the resulting precision differ strongly depending on whether the device is of fermionic or bosonic nature. Using scattering theory, we show that the precision is bounded by constraints set by the entropy production and by the activity in the spirit of thermodynamic or kinetic uncertainty relations, valid for fermionic and bosonic quantum systems and even in the absence of time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we derive a combined thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relation, which is tight over a wide range of parameters and can hence predict the reachable precision of a device.
  Since these constraints can be expressed in terms of observables accessible in transport measurements, such as currents and bandwidth, we foresee that the tight thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty-like bounds are also useful as an inference tool: they can be exploited to estimate entropy production from transport observables, such as the charge current and its noise, which are more easily accessible in experiment.</description>

      <title>Analog phase-sensitive time-reversal of optically-carried radiofrequency signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Rydberg Atom Arrays Meet Cavity-QED: Emergence of the Superradiant Clock Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom triangular arrays in an optical cavity serve as an ideal platform for understanding the interplay between geometric frustration and quantized photons. Using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain a rich ground state phase diagram. Around half-filling, the infinite long-range light-matter interaction lifts the ground state degeneracy, resulting in a novel order-coexisted superradiant clock (SRC) phase that completely destroys the fragile order-by-disorder (OBD) phase observed in classical light fields. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, this replacement may result from the competition between threefold and sixfold clock terms. Similar to the spin supersolid, the clear first-order phase transition at the $Z_2$ symmetry line is attributed to the nonzero photon density, which couples to the threefold clock term. Finally, we discuss the low-energy physics in the dimer language and propose that cavity-mediated nonlocal ring exchange interactions may play a critical role in the rich physics induced by the attachment of cavity-QED. Our work opens a new arena of research on the emergent phenomena of quantum phase transitions in many-body quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Advantage in Locally Checkable Labeling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first known example of a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) that admits asymptotic distributed quantum advantage in the LOCAL model of distributed computing: our problem can be solved in $O(\log n)$ communication rounds in the quantum-LOCAL model, but it requires $\Omega(\log n \cdot \log^{0.99} \log n)$ communication rounds in the classical randomized-LOCAL model. We also show that distributed quantum advantage cannot be arbitrarily large: if an LCL problem can be solved in $T(n)$ rounds in the quantum-LOCAL model, it can also be solved in $\tilde O(\sqrt{n T(n)})$ rounds in the classical randomized-LOCAL model. In particular, a problem that is strictly global classically is also almost-global in quantum-LOCAL. Our second result also holds for $T(n)$-dependent probability distributions. As a corollary, if there exists a finitely dependent distribution over valid labelings of some LCL problem $\Pi$, then the same problem $\Pi$ can also be solved in $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$ rounds in the classical randomized-LOCAL and deterministic-LOCAL models. That is, finitely dependent distributions cannot exist for global LCL problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum circuit simulations of the transverse field Ising model with longitudinal fields, displaying salient features of glassy dynamics. The energy landscape and spin configurations of toy models are considered, using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to obtain the ground-state energies and corresponding eigenstates for a $6 \times 6$ Ising lattice using 36 qubits and a 1-dimensional Ising chain of length 25 using 25 qubits. The former showed disordered spin configurations for a specific mixture of values of the two fields. These insights mirror catalytic processes, where disorder within a catalyst can lead to inefficient reaction mechanisms. Results obtained from our proof-of-principle implementation make the case for kick-starting more concentrated efforts in harnessing existing quantum computational tools for computationally probing complex dynamical behaviour arising in quantum matter. Our aim is to leverage tools from quantum information processing to bring about a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics and structure of glassy systems, ultimately informing the development of novel materials and technology.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) [Quantum Inf. Comput., 10, 470-497 (2010)] -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Probability in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>

Abstract: Ultimately, any explanation of quantum measurement must be extendable to relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM), since many precisely confirmed experimental results follow from quantum field theory (QFT), which is based on RQM. Certainly, the traditional "collapse" postulate for quantum measurement is problematic in a relativistic context, at the very least because, as usually formulated, it violates the relativity of simultaneity. The present paper addresses this with a relativistic model of measurement in which the state of the universe is decomposed into decoherent histories of measurements recorded within it. The approach is essentially Everettian, in the sense that it uses the unmodified, unitary quantum formalism of RQM. But it addresses the difficulty with typical "many worlds" interpretations on how to even define probabilities over different possible ``worlds''. To do this, Zurek's concept of envariance is generalized to the context of relativistic spacetime, giving an objective definition of the probability of any one of the quantum histories, consistent with Born's rule. It is then shown that the statistics of any repeated experiment within the universe also tend to follow the Born rule as the number of repetitions increases. The wave functions that we actually use for such experiments are local reductions of very coarse-grained superpositions of universal eigenstates, and their "collapse" can be re-interpreted as simply an update based on additional incremental knowledge gained from a measurement about the "real" eigenstate of our universe.</description>

Abstract: Models of interacting many-body quantum systems that may realize new exotic phases of matter, notably quantum spin liquids, are challenging to study using even state-of-the-art classical methods such as tensor network simulations. Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations and hardware demonstration, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Our results strongly suggest that these hybrid algorithms present a promising direction for studying quantum spin liquids and more generally for resolving important unsolved problems in condensed matter theory and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The interface between quantum theory and gravity represents still uncharted territory. Recently, some works suggested promising alternative approaches aimed at witnessing quantum features to test the fundamental nature of gravity in tabletop experiments: Two masses in an initial superposition of spatially localized states are allowed to interact only through gravity and it is measured whether the final state is entangled. Here we show that one can generate the same amount of entanglement in this setup by using classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion. We argue that theories of quantum gravity that can be approximated by the Newtonian potential and classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion will generate gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Frustration Elimination and Excited State Search in Coherent Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustration, that is, the impossibility of satisfying the energetic preferences between all spin pairs simultaneously, underlies the complexity of many fundamental properties in spin systems, including the computational difficulty in determining their ground states. Coherent Ising machines (CIMs) have been proposed as a promising analog computational approach to efficiently find different degenerate ground states of large and complex Ising models. However, CIMs also face challenges in solving frustrated Ising models: frustration not only reduces the probability of finding good solutions, but it also prohibits the leveraging quantum effects in doing so. To circumvent these detrimental effects of frustration, we show how frustrated Ising models can be mapped to frustration-free CIM configurations by including ancillary modes and modifying the coupling protocol used in current CIM designs. Such frustration elimination may empower current CIMs to benefit from quantum effects in dealing with frustrated Ising models. In addition, these ancillary modes can also enable error detection and searching for excited states.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoding of logical algorithms with transversal gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is believed to be essential for scalable quantum computation, but its implementation is challenging due to its considerable space-time overhead. Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating efficient manipulation of logical qubits using transversal gates (Bluvstein et al., Nature 626, 58-65 (2024)), we show that the performance of logical algorithms can be substantially improved by decoding the qubits jointly to account for error propagation during transversal entangling gates. We find that such correlated decoding improves the performance of both Clifford and non-Clifford transversal entangling gates, and explore two decoders offering different computational runtimes and accuracies. In particular, by leveraging the deterministic propagation of stabilizer measurement errors through transversal Clifford gates, we find that correlated decoding enables the number of noisy syndrome extraction rounds between these gates to be reduced from $O(d)$ to $O(1)$ in Clifford circuits, where $d$ is the code distance. We verify numerically that this approach substantially reduces the space-time cost of deep logical Clifford circuits. These results demonstrate that correlated decoding provides a major advantage in early fault-tolerant computation, as realized in recent experiments, and further indicate it has considerable potential to reduce the space-time cost in large-scale logical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectroscopy via Generalized Quantum Phase Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response theory has a successful history of connecting experimental observations with theoretical predictions. Of particular interest is the optical response of matter, from which spectroscopy experiments can be modelled. However, the calculation of response properties for quantum systems is often prohibitively expensive, especially for nonlinear spectroscopy, as it requires access to either the time evolution of the system or to excited states. In this work, we introduce a generalized quantum phase estimation framework designed for multi-variate phase estimation. This allows the treatment of general correlation functions enabling the recovery of response properties of arbitrary orders. The generalized quantum phase estimation circuit has an intuitive construction that is linked with a physical process of interest, and can directly sample frequencies from the distribution that would be obtained experimentally. In addition, we provide a single-ancilla modification of the new framework for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Overall, our framework enables the efficient simulation of spectroscopy experiments beyond the linear regime, such as Raman spectroscopy, having that the circuit cost grows linearly with respect to the order of the target nonlinear response. This opens up an exciting new field of applications for quantum computers with potential technological impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of quantum phenomena often necessitates sufficiently pure states, a requirement that can be challenging to achieve. In this study, our goal is to prepare a non-classical state originating from a mixed state, utilizing dynamics that preserve the initial low purity of the state. We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these ``hot'' Schr\"odinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 Kelvin, sixty times hotter than the cavity's physical environment. Our realization of highly mixed quantum superposition states could be implemented with other continuous-variable systems e.g. nanomechanical oscillators, for which ground-state cooling remains challenging.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement purification and distillation protocols are essential for harnessing the full potential of quantum communication technologies. Multiple strategies have been proposed to approach and optimize such protocols, most however restricted to Clifford operations. In this paper, we introduce a superposed entanglement purification design strategy, leveraging coherent superpositions of the roles of entangled states to enhance purification efficiency, defining a new family of non-Clifford distillation protocols. We demonstrate how this approach can be hierarchically integrated with existing entanglement purification strategies, consistently improving protocols performance.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to prepare non-classical states of the electromagnetic field in a microwave resonator. It is based on a controlled gate that applies a squeezing operation on a SQUID-terminated resonator conditioned on the state of a dispersively coupled qubit. This controlled-squeeze gate, when combined with Gaussian operations on the resonator, is universal. We explore the use of this tool to map an arbitrary qubit state into a superposition of squeezed states. In particular, we target a bosonic code with well-defined superparity which makes photon losses detectable by non-demolition parity measurements. We analyze the possibility of implementing this using state-of-the-art circuit QED tools and conclude that it is within reach of current technologies.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize machine learning, offering significant efficiency gains in tasks such as clustering and distance estimation. Additionally, it provides enhanced security through fundamental principles like the measurement postulate and the no-cloning theorem, enabling secure protocols such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution. While advancements in secure quantum machine learning are notable, the development of secure and distributed quantum analogues of kernel-based machine learning techniques remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present a novel approach for securely computing common kernels, including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and Laplacian kernels, when data is distributed, using quantum feature maps. Our methodology introduces a robust framework that leverages quantum teleportation to ensure secure and distributed kernel learning. The proposed architecture is validated using IBM's Qiskit Aer Simulator on various public datasets.</description>

Abstract: Recursive Fourier Sampling (RFS) is one of the earliest problems demonstrating a quantum advantage, and is known to lie outside the Merlin-Arthur complexity class. This work contains a new description of quantum algorithms in phase space terminology, demonstrating its use in RFS, and how and why this gives a better understanding of the quantum advantage in RFS. Most importantly, describing the computational process of quantum computation in phase space terminology gives a much better understanding of why uncomputation is necessary when solving RFS: the advantage is present only when phase coordinate garbage is uncomputed. This is the underlying reason for the limitations of the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Fast gradient-free optimization of excitations in variational quantum eigensolvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast globally-informed gradient-free optimizer for physically-motivated ans\"atze constructed of excitation operators, a common choice in variational quantum eigensolvers. ExcitationSolve extends quantum-aware and hyperparameter-free optimizers such as Rotosolve, from parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^2=I$, e.g., rotations, to the more general class of $G^3=G$ exhibited by the physically-inspired excitation operators such as in the unitary coupled cluster approach. ExcitationSolve determines the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for one update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed and adaptive variational ans\"atze, as well as a multi-parameter generalization for the simultaneous selection and optimization of multiple excitation operators. We demonstrate the utility of ExcitationSolve on molecular ground state energy calculations, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art optimizers commonly employed in variational quantum algorithms. Across all tested molecules in equilibrium geometry, ExcitationSolve remarkably reaches chemical accuracy in a single parameter sweep in a fixed ansatz. In addition, ExcitationSolve achieves adaptive ans\"atze consisting of fewer operators than in the gradient-based adaptive approach. Finally, ExcitationSolve shows robustness against substantial noise in real quantum hardware, retaining an advantage over other optimizers.</description>

      <title>The Black-Box Simulation Barrier Persists in a Fully Quantum World</title>

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols have been intensely studied due to their fundamental importance and versatility. However, quantum information's inherent differences significantly alter the landscape, necessitating a re-examination of ZK designs.
  A crucial aspect is round complexity, linked to $\textit{simulation}$, which forms the foundation of ZK definition and security proofs. In the $\textit{post-quantum}$ setting, where honest parties and channels are classical but adversaries quantum, Chia et al. [FOCS'21] showed constant-round $\textit{black-box-simulatable}$ ZK arguments (BBZK) for $\mathbf{NP}$ are impossible unless $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$. But this problem remains open when all parties and communication are quantum.
  Indeed, this problem interests the broader theory of quantum computing. Investigating how quantum power alters tasks like the $\textit{unconditional}$ security of QKD and incorporating OT in MiniQCrypt has been crucial. Moreover, quantum communication has enabled round compression for commitments and interactive arguments. Along this line, understanding if quantum computing could fundamentally change ZK protocols is vital.
  We resolved this problem by proving that only languages in $\mathbf{BQP}$ admit constant-round $\textit{fully-quantum}$ BBZK. This result holds significant implications. Firstly, it illuminates the nature of quantum zero-knowledge and provides valuable insights for designing future protocols in the quantum realm. Secondly, it relates ZK round complexity with the intriguing problem of $\mathbf{BQP}$ vs $\mathbf{QMA}$, which is out of the reach of previous analogue impossibility results in the classical or post-quantum setting. Lastly, it justifies the need for the $\textit{non-black-box}$ simulation techniques or the relaxed security notions employed in existing constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocols.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an approach for characterizing non-local quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behaviour of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates. By the example of solving a simple Ising model it is shown that digital quantum simulations performed with quantum computers can provide accurate description of the entanglement of the degenerate systems even in the presence of noise. We also discuss the ground state properties of degenerate fermionic and bosonic models, which can be useful for theoretical analysis of the experiments with ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: A particle-hole symmetry protected 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is investigated. This version differs from the usual Hermitian version by the inclusion of gain and/or loss terms which are represented by complex on-site potentials. The exceptional points occur, when the dimensionless potential magnitude and the hopping amplitudes become close to unity, leading to the coalescence of eigenvalues and nontrivial eigenvector degeneracies. Furthermore, the vectored Zak phase quantization has been obtained and a topolectric RLC circuit has been analysed. If realized experimentally (in photonic and acoustic crystals), the quantization is expected to lead to an extended bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Commuting Local Hamiltonians Beyond 2D</title>

Abstract: Commuting local Hamiltonians provide a testing ground for studying many of the most interesting open questions in quantum information theory, including the quantum PCP conjecture and the existence of area laws. Although they are a simplified model of quantum computation, the status of the commuting local Hamiltonian problem remains largely unknown. A number of works have shown that increasingly expressive families of commuting local Hamiltonians admit completely classical verifiers. Despite intense work, the largest class of commuting local Hamiltonians we can place in NP are those on a square lattice, where each lattice site is a qutrit. Even worse, many of the techniques used to analyze these problems rely heavily on the geometry of the square lattice and the properties of the numbers 2 and 3 as local dimensions. In this work, we present a new technique to analyze the complexity of various families of commuting local Hamiltonians: guided reductions. Intuitively, these are a generalization of typical reduction where the prover provides a guide so that the verifier can construct a simpler Hamiltonian. The core of our reduction is a new rounding technique based on a combination of Jordan's Lemma and the Structure Lemma. Our rounding technique is much more flexible than previous work, and allows us to show that a larger family of commuting local Hamiltonians is in NP, albiet with the restriction that all terms are rank-1. Specifically, we prove the following two results:
  1. Commuting local Hamiltonians in 2D that are rank-1 are contained in NP, independent of the qudit dimension. Note that this family of commuting local Hamiltonians has no restriction on the local dimension or the locality.
  2. We prove that rank-1, 3D commuting Hamiltonians with qudits on edges are in NP. To our knowledge this is the first time a family of 3D commuting local Hamiltonians has been contained in NP.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of Hamiltonian learning for positive temperature bosonic Gaussian states, the quantum generalization of the widely studied problem of learning Gaussian graphical models. We obtain efficient protocols, both in sample and computational complexity, for the task of inferring the parameters of their underlying quadratic Hamiltonian under the assumption of bounded temperature, squeezing, displacement and maximal degree of the interaction graph. Our protocol only requires heterodyne measurements, which are often experimentally feasible, and has a sample complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of modes. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to learn the underlying interaction graph in a similar setting and sample complexity. Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a more advanced state when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either unavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our techniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace distance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of modes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main technical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and Hamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest, combined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local inversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian state by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose size scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way we bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix, controlling the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Complexity Theory for Quantum Promise Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin by establishing structural results for several fundamental quantum complexity classes: p/mBQP, p/mQ(C)MA, $\text{p/mQSZK}_{\text{hv}}$, p/mQIP, p/mBQP/qpoly, p/mBQP/poly, and p/mPSPACE. This includes identifying complete problems, as well as proving containment and separation results among these classes. Here, p/mC denotes the corresponding quantum promise complexity class with pure (p) or mixed (m) quantum input states for any classical complexity class C. Surprisingly, our findings uncover relationships that diverge from their classical analogues -- specifically, we show unconditionally that p/mQIP$\neq$p/mPSPACE and p/mBQP/qpoly$\neq$p/mBQP/poly. This starkly contrasts the classical setting, where QIP$=$PSPACE and separations such as BQP/qpoly$\neq$BQP/poly are only known relative to oracles.
  For applications, we address interesting questions in quantum cryptography, quantum property testing, and unitary synthesis using this new framework. In particular, we show the first unconditional secure auxiliary-input quantum commitment with statistical hiding, solving an open question in [Qia24,MNY24], and demonstrate the first pure quantum state property testing problem that only needs exponentially fewer samples and runtime in the interactive model than the single-party model, which is analogous to Chiesa and Gur [CG18] studying interactive mode for distribution testing. Also, our works offer new insights into Impagliazzo's five worlds view. Roughly, by substituting classical complexity classes in Pessiland, Heuristica, and Algorithmica with mBQP and mQCMA or $\text{mQSZK}_\text{hv}$, we establish a natural connection between quantum cryptography and quantum promise complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with duplex qubits of silicon vacancy centers in SiC at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between $|m=\pm 3/2\rangle$ and $|m=\pm 1/2\rangle$ states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between $|+1/2\rangle$ and $|-1/2\rangle$ states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., $\left\{|+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ states) leaves the population in the remaining state ($|-1/2\rangle$) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate $\left\{ |+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ and $\left\{ |-1/2\rangle, |-3/2\rangle \right\}$. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Logical Bell State Generation in Memory Assisted Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of utilizing quantum error correction (QEC) to generate and store logical Bell states in heralded quantum entanglement protocols, crucial for quantum repeater networks. Two lattice surgery-based protocols (local and non-local) are introduced to establish logical Bell states between distant nodes using an intermediary node. We simulate the protocols using realistic experimental parameters, including ion trap memories, noisy optical channels, frequency conversion, and non-destructive detection of photonic qubits. The study evaluates rotated and planar surface codes alongside Bacon-Shor codes for small code distances ($d = 3, 5$) under depolarizing and physical noise models. Pseudo-thresholds are identified, with physical error rates above $p_{\text{err}} \sim 10^{-3}$ offering no advantage over unencoded Bell states under depolarizing noise. Pseudo-thresholds are also reevaluated in terms of gate error rates $p_{\text{err}_H}$, $p_{\text{err}_{CX}}$, and $p_{\text{err}_M}$. For a distance of 1 km between the end node and the intermediary, an advantage over unencoded Bell-state heralded protocols requires reducing gate error rates by an order of magnitude ($0.1p_{\text{err}_H}$, $0.1p_{\text{err}_{CX}}$, and $0.1p_{\text{err}_M}$). These results highlight the need for significant hardware improvements to implement logical Bell state protocols with quantum memories. Additionally, the non-local protocol rate was analyzed, achieving rates up to $(32.53 \pm 1.53) \, \mathrm{Hz}$ over distances of $1$ to $80 \, \mathrm{km}$ between the end node and the intermediary node.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules Acting as an Inborn Emitter-Resonator Quantum System in Free Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Engineering tunable decoherence-free subspaces with collective atom-cavity interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose schemes to design and control a time-dependent decoherence-free subspace (DFS) in a dissipative atom-cavity system. These schemes use atoms with three internal energy levels, which allows for the DFS to be multi-dimensional--a condition important for quantum sensing, simulation, and computation. We consider the use of tunable external driving lasers to transfer the system from a coherent spin state to a highly degenerate DFS. We find that the typical state in the DFS is highly entangled. Throughout evolution the state is kept in an instantaneous DFS, thereby allowing for pure states to be prepared. We develop adiabatic shortcuts to carry out this evolution with higher purity and fidelity than standard adiabatic and dissipative methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizing quantum state-space with a single quantum measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can the state-space of $d$-dimensional quantum theory be derived from studying the behavior of a single "reference" measuring device? The answer is yes, if the measuring device corresponds to a complex-projective 3-design. In this privileged case, not only does each quantum state correspond to a probability-distribution over the outcomes of a single measurement, but also the probability-distributions which correspond to quantum states can be elegantly characterized as those which respect a generalized uncertainty principle. The latter takes the form of a lower-bound on the variance of a natural class of observables as measured by the reference. We give simple equations which pure-state probability distributions must satisfy, and contextualize these results by showing how 3-designs allow the structure-coefficients of the Jordan algebra of observables to be extracted from the probabilities which characterize the reference measurement itself. This lends credence to the view that quantum theory ought to be primarily understood as a set of normative constraints on probability assignments which reflect nature's lack of hidden variables, and further cements the significance of 3-designs in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Space-time Peer-to-Peer Distribution of Multi-party Entanglement for Any Quantum Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled states, of which bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network can be essential for further large-scale quantum networks. We propose a novel quantum network protocol called P2PGSD inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to efficiently implement the general graph state distribution in the network layer, which demonstrates advantages in resource efficiency and scalability over existing methods for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for a general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. In addition, we leverage the spacetime quantum network inspired by the symmetry from relativity for memory management in network problems and used it to improve our proposed algorithm. The advantages of our protocols are confirmed by numerical simulations showing an improvement of up to 50% for general sparse graph states, paving the way for a resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution across any network topology.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. This makes empirical coordination a natural and operationally meaningful framework for quantum systems - particularly in the context of nonlocal games, which rely on repeated measurements to assess performance. We begin by analyzing networks with classical links, focusing on the cascade network. For this setting, we establish the optimal coordination rates, which indicate the minimal resources required to simulate a quantum state on average. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination.
  Our analysis starts with a basic two-node scenario and extends to cascade networks, including the special case of a network with an isolated node. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition.
  We then extend the framework to networks with quantum links, focusing on a broadcast setting where the receivers have side information. Finally, we discuss how our results provide new insights into the implementation and simulation of quantum nonlocal games in the empirical regime.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform direct fidelity estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using only local Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ, W, and Dicke states, establishing tighter bounds (by factor of $14.22$ and $16$ for GHZ and W, respectively) on the number of measurements required for desired precision. These protocols are derived by adjusting the distribution of observables. Notably, they require no preprocessing steps other than the sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in molecular optomechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to generate nonreciprocal bipartite entanglement between a cavity mode and vibrational modes in a molecular cavity optomechanical system. Our system consists of $\mathcal{N}$ molecules placed inside a spinning whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator. The vibrational modes of these molecules are coupled to the WGM resonator mode (which is analogous to a plasmonic cavity) and the resonator is also coupled to an auxiliary optical cavity. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal photon-vibration entanglement and nonreciprocal vibration-vibration entanglement can be generated in this system, even at high temperatures. These nonreciprocal entanglements arise due to the Sagnac-Fizeau effect induced by the spinning WGM resonator. We find that spinning the WGM resonator in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction enhances both types of nonreciprocal entanglement, especially under blue-detuned driving of the optical cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that vibration-vibration entanglement can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of molecules. Our findings have potential applications in quantum information transmission and in the development of nonreciprocal quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Chemically-Accurate Prediction of the Ionisation Potential of Helium Using a Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the microscopic behaviour of materials and chemical processes by enabling high-accuracy electronic structure calculations to scale more efficiently than is possible using classical computers. Current quantum computing hardware devices suffer from the dual challenges of noise and cost, which raises the question of what practical value these devices might offer before full fault tolerance is achieved and economies of scale enable cheaper access. Here we examine the practical value of noisy quantum computers as tools for high-accuracy electronic structure, by using a Quantinuum ion-trap quantum computer to predict the ionisation potential of helium. By combining a series of techniques suited for use with current hardware including qubit-efficient encoding coupled with chemical insight, low-cost variational optimisation with hardware-adapted quantum circuits, and moments-based corrections, we obtain an ionisation potential of 24.5536 (+0.0011, -0.0005) eV, which agrees with the experimentally measured value to within true chemical accuracy, and with high statistical confidence. The methods employed here can be generalised to predict other properties and expand our understanding of the value that might be provided by near-term quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the time of arrival probability distribution of a quantum particle using the Bohmian formalism. The pilot-wave is given by the wave function of the one dimensional vacuum squeezed state but written in the Schr\"odinger representation. We made use of the unitary representation of the symplectic group in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The solution to the Bohmian equations are analytical function thus allowing for a closed expression of the time of arrival distribution which differs from the counterparts in the standard quantum mechanics formulation.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Wave Function as a Complex Probability Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some elements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum theory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that produces this so-called "wave-like" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic hidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight into the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to fault tolerant quantum computation using topological qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>On the Alleged Locality in the Schr\"odinger Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vedral claims that the Schr\"odinger picture can describe quantum systems as locally as the Heisenberg picture, relying on a product notation for the density matrix. Here, I refute that claim. I show that the so-called `local factors' in the product notation do not correspond to individual systems and therefore fail to satisfy Einsteinian locality. Furthermore, the product notation does not track where local gates are applied. Finally, I expose internal inconsistencies in the argument: if, as is also stated, Schr\"odinger-picture locality ultimately depends on explicit bookkeeping of all operations, then the explanatory power of the product notation is de facto undermined.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>STQS: A Unified System Architecture for Spatial Temporal Quantum Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing (QS) harnesses quantum phenomena to measure physical observables with extraordinary precision, sensitivity, and resolution. Despite significant advancements in quantum sensing, prevailing efforts have focused predominantly on refining the underlying sensor materials and hardware. Given the growing demands of increasingly complex application domains and the continued evolution of quantum sensing technologies, the present moment is the right time to systematically explore distributed quantum sensing architectures and their corresponding design space.
  We present STQS, a unified system architecture for spatiotemporal quantum sensing that interlaces four key quantum components: sensing, memory, communication, and computation. By employing a comprehensive gate-based framework, we systemically explore the design space of quantum sensing schemes and probe the influence of noise at each state in a sensing workflow through simulation. We introduce a novel distance-based metric that compares reference states to sensing states and assigns a confidence level. We anticipate that the distance measure will serve as an intermediate step towards more advanced quantum signal processing techniques like quantum machine learning. To our knowledge, STQS is the first system-level framework to integrate quantum sensing within a coherent, unified architectural paradigm. STQS provides seamless avenues for unique state preparation, multi-user sensing requests, and addressing practical implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of STQS through evaluations of quantum radar and qubit-based dark matter detection. To highlight the near-term feasibility of our approach, we present results obtained from IBM's Marrakesh and IonQ's Forte devices, validating key STQS components on present day quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Quality Factors Approaching 10 Million in Superconducting Planar Resonators via Spiral Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of spiral geometry in superconducting resonators to achieve high intrinsic quality factors, crucial for applications in quantum computation and quantum sensing. We fabricated Archimedean Spiral Resonators (ASRs) using domain-matched epitaxially grown titanium nitride (TiN) on silicon wafers, achieving intrinsic quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.6 \pm 1.5) \times 10^6$ at the single-photon level and $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.91 \pm 0.39) \times 10^7$ at high power, significantly outperforming traditional coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators.
  We conducted a comprehensive numerical analysis using COMSOL to calculate surface participation ratios (PRs) at critical interfaces: metal-air, metal-substrate, and substrate-air. Our findings reveal that ASRs have lower PRs than CPWs, explaining their superior quality factors and reduced coupling to two-level systems (TLSs).</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2" target="_blank"&gt;[King et al., Nature (2023)]&lt;/a&gt; in solving certain hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results raise the bar for a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Tunable Non-Hermitian Nonlinear Microwave Dimer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' if there is a large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I report the existence of exactly one non-trivial solution to the equation $i(A,B)+i(A,\neg B)+i(\neg A,B)+i(\neg A,\neg B)= 0$, where $i(A,B)=\log\frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(A)P(B)}$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of the proposition $A$. The equation specifies an information balance condition between two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and by this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational relationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \sim B$.
  The $\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between probabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly simplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an answer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?, Yes).
  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\sim$ relationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions, questions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be given, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$ to $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability distribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing questions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of information as well as addition.
  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically. Remarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same structure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system. We will find that the essential mathematical structure of the two-state quantum system can be derived from the mathematics of questions, including non-commutativity, complementarity, wavefunction collapse, the Hilbert space representation and the Born rule, as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-attention has revolutionized classical machine learning, yet existing quantum self-attention models underutilize quantum states' potential due to oversimplified or incomplete mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce the Quantum Complex-Valued Self-Attention Model (QCSAM), the first framework to leverage complex-valued similarities, which captures amplitude and phase relationships between quantum states more comprehensively. To achieve this, QCSAM extends the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCUs) into the Complex LCUs (CLCUs) framework, enabling precise complex-valued weighting of quantum states and supporting quantum multi-head attention. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that QCSAM outperforms recent quantum self-attention models, including QKSAN, QSAN, and GQHAN. With only 4 qubits, QCSAM achieves 100% and 99.2% test accuracies on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate scalability across 3-8 qubits and 2-4 class tasks, while ablation studies validate the advantages of complex-valued attention weights over real-valued alternatives. This work advances quantum machine learning by enhancing the expressiveness and precision of quantum self-attention in a way that aligns with the inherent complexity of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limits in dephasing dynamics of a qubit system coupled to thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum speed limits (QSLs) of a qubit system coupled to a thermal dephasing environment with an Ohmic-like spectral density. Based on the geometric QSLs time bound, which is derived by employing the trace distance to quantify the geodesic between two distinguishable states in dynamical evolution, we study the influences of the temperature and spectral density of the environment on the QSLs time of the dephasing qubit. We also investigate the interplay between the QSLs time, the environmental temperature, and the spectral density of the environment. It has been demonstrated that, the QSLs time closely depends on the transition frequency and the dynamical behavior (e.g., coherence trapping) of the dephasing qubit. For a fixed Ohmicity parameter of the environmental spectral density, the increase of environmental temperature can enhance the QSLs time bound. In addition, when the environmental temperature remains constant, the increase in the Ohmicity parameter initially leads to a reduction in the QSLs time bound, which is then followed by an increase of the time bound of QSLs. Our results can help to better understand the QSLs in the dynamics of open quantum systems and have potential application in the modulation of QSLs time in the dephasing qubit by engineering the spectral density of the environment.</description>

Abstract: Many significant quantum physical systems are characterized by Hamiltonians expressible as a linear combination of time-independent generators of a closed Lie algebra, $\hat{H}(t)=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\eta_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}$. The Wei-Norman method provides a framework for determining the coefficients of the corresponding time evolution operator in its factorized representation, $\hat{U}(t) = \prod_{l=1}^{L} e^{ \Lambda_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}}$. This work introduces $\texttt{Symdyn}$, a Python library that automates the application of this method. The library efficiently computes similarity transformations and the nonlinear differential equations intrinsic to derive Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-like relations and the time evolution of high-order quantum systems ($L\geq 6$). We demonstrate its robustness by deriving the time evolution operator for a system of two time-dependent coupled harmonic oscillators. Additionally, we specialize the library to the Lie group $\textit{SU}(N)$, showing its versatility with $\textit{SU}(2)$, $\textit{SU}(3)$ and $\textit{SU}(4)$ examples, relevant to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Robust entangled photon generation by Floquet-engineered two-colour pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the variational quantum singular value decomposition based on encoding the elements of the considered matrix into the state of a quantum system of appropriate dimension. This method doesn't use the expansion of this matrix in terms of the unitary matrices. Conditional measurement is involved to avoid small success probability in ancilla measurement. The objective function for maximization algorithm can be obtained probabilistically via measurement of the state of a one-qubit subsystem. The circuit requires $O(\log N)$ qubits for realization of this algorithm whose depths is $O(\log N)$ as well.</description>

      <title>Self-organized cavity bosons beyond the adiabatic elimination approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-time behavior of weakly interacting bosons moving in a two-dimensional optical lattice and coupled to a lossy cavity is investigated numerically via the truncated Wigner method, which allows us to take into full account the dynamics of the cavity mode, quantum fluctuations, cavity-boson correlations, and self-organization of individual runs. We first compare our results for small systems with quasi-exact calculations based on quantum trajectories, finding a remarkably good agreement for experimentally relevant boson fillings that improves further with system size. For large systems, we observe metastability at very long times and superfluid quasi-long range order, in sharp contrast with the true long range order found in the ground state of the approximate Bose-Hubbard model with extended interactions, obtained by adiabatically eliminating the cavity field. As the strength of the light-matter coupling increases, the system first becomes supersolid at the Dicke superradiant transition and then turns into a charge-density wave via the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. The two phase transitions are characterized via an accurate finite-size scaling analysis.</description>

      <title>Intensity Correlation Measurement to Simulate Two-body BICs and Probe Nonlinear Discrete Breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hanbury Brown-Twiss spatial intensity correlations in femtosecond laser-fabricated photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices using coherent input states with tunable phases. By mapping intensity correlations to the two-body quantum walk, we experimentally simulate edge bound states in the continuum (BICs) of two indistinguishable bosons. These two-body edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. We then discuss how intensity correlations can capture the dynamics of two identical fermions for which BICs do not exist on the same edge of the lattice. The localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of long-lived edge breathers -- spatially localized nonlinear states with oscillating intensity along the propagation distance. For stronger nonlinearities, localized edge states are not formed for a range of phases, destroying the localization of the intensity correlation. Our results highlight the interplay of band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and intensity correlations.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved otherwise with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable progress in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not conceptually linked to the quantum theory of dissipation of the Lindbladian formalism which is unsatisfactory for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics in a local mean-field theory for weak external fields. The derivation also extends the LL dynamics beyond the orientation $\vec{m}/|\vec{m}|$ to the length $|\vec{m}|$ of the magnetization. A key assumption is that the Lindbladian dissipation adapts to the non-equilibrium $H(t)$ instantaneously to lower its expectation value.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Learning for Small Dataset Modeling in Semiconductor Fabrication: Application to Ohmic Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex semiconductor fabrication processes, such as Ohmic contact formation in unconventional semiconductor devices, pose significant modeling challenges due to a large number of operational variables and the difficulty of collecting large, high-quality datasets. Classical machine learning (CML) models often struggle in such scenarios, where the data is both high-dimensional and limited in quantity, leading to overfitting and reduced predictive accuracy. To address this challenge, we develop the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to model this semiconductor process, leveraging quantum systems' capacity to efficiently capture complex correlations in high-dimensional spaces and generalize well with small datasets. Using only 159 experimental samples augmented via a variational autoencoder, we report a quantum kernel-based regressor (SQKR) with a static 2-level ZZ feature map. The SQKR consistently outperformed six mainstream CML models across all evaluation metrics, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), with repeated experiments confirming its robustness. Notably, SQKR achieved an MAE of 0.314 Ohm-mm with data from experimental verification, demonstrating its ability to effectively model semiconductor fabrication processes despite limited data availability. These results highlight QML's unique capability to handle small yet high-dimensional datasets in the semiconductor industry, making it a promising alternative to classical approaches for semiconductor process modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study a previously unexplored class of topological states protected by hidden chiral symmetries that are local, that is, that protect against any off-diagonal disorder. We derive their related topological invariant for the first time, and show that these previously unidentified symmetries can act together with standard chiral symmetries to increase the protection of the end modes, using the Creutz ladder as an example. Finally, thanks to local hidden symmetries, we show that the diamond necklace chain can have three different types of topological end modes: strong, weak or square-root, with some of the states inheriting their topology from others. This marks the first time a square-root topological insulator is identified as its own parent.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>

Abstract: Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are, respectively, driven by disorder and non-reciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian (NH) version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate localization-delocalization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between AL and NHSE can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate quantum jumps between the NH-induced skin states and the AL states to occur in the system. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The localization properties of our model can be studied by analyzing the voltage profile (VP) of the circuit. The VP exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the NHSE, while the phenomenon of AL can be perceived via the localization of the VP in the vicinity of the excitation node where the power supply is connected. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the VP. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the NH AA model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits that should open avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic devices, such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient information transfer systems.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Mixmaster Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the collective modes of an atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In particular we focus on the breathing mode of the soliton, which is not a single linearized normal mode but a common component of many modes, and therefore decays within a $t^{-1/2}$ envelope due to dispersion. If the soliton is held in the center of a harmonic trap, we show that the breathing amplitude revives periodically, as atoms shed from the vibrating soliton oscillate in the trap, and return. After each revival the breathing amplitude again decays, and this cycle repeats every trap half-period. The amplitude envelope of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, however, with a gradual increase in breathing followed by sudden drop in breathing amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum, and offer this coherent Bogoliubov-de Gennes phenomenon as a background against which to compare possible quantum many-body effects, including decoherence over trap-period time scales.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>

      <title>Effective Mode Description for Macroscopic Fabry P\'{e}rot Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective modes formalism to describe how the quasi-continuum of photonic modes in an optical cavity effectively behaves in the strong light-matter coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. By expressing these effective modes, we are able to show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-P\'erot cavity mirrors. Further, our theoretical framework shows that the photonic density of state for a Fabry-P\'erot exhibits a sharp peak at the normal incidence and is quality factor dependent. These results provide a possible explanation for the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity.</description>
