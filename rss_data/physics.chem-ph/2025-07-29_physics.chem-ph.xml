      <title>A Unified Semiclassical Framework for Ultrafast Competitive Electron Transfer in Multiredox Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast multistage electron transfer (ET) in molecular systems with multiple redox centers is fundamental to photochemical energy conversion, including processes in natural photosynthesis, molecular optoelectronics, and organic photovoltaics. These systems often operate under nonequilibrium conditions, where solvent relaxation, intramolecular vibrations, and competing ET pathways jointly determine reaction kinetics and product yields. In this chapter, we present a unified semiclassical framework for modeling ultrafast, competitive ET in multiredox compounds embedded in polar environments with complex relaxation dynamics. The approach constructs diabatic free energy surfaces (FESs) in a multidimensional coordinate space that integrates both polarization and relaxation components of the environment within a unified representation. Electron dynamics are described using a stochastic point-transition method that captures the coupling between nonadiabatic quantum transitions and classical nuclear motion. The formalism generalizes and unifies several established semiclassical models - including the Najbar-Tachiya, Zusman-Beratan, and Sumi-Marcus approaches - and supports efficient simulation of multistage ET cascades. As an application, we investigate ultrafast charge separation in donor-acceptor-acceptor (D-A1-A2) triads, showing how hot charge shift to a secondary acceptor can suppress nonequilibrium charge recombination. Numerical simulations reveal how reorganization energies, vibrational coupling, molecular geometry, and bending angle collectively influence ET efficiency. The proposed framework offers a general and scalable tool for the rational design of photofunctional molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Chemical Space of Molecular Nanomotors: Optimizing Photochemical Properties for One- and Two-photon Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-driven molecular nanomotors hold promise for applications in material science and biomedicine. Significant efforts have focused on improving their efficiency, often targeting single candidate molecules. Here, we present a systematic data-driven approach to design nanomotors with high isomerization quantum yields for one- and two-photon applications, the latter being critical for biomedical applications requiring near-infrared light. We analyze the excited state properties of a dataset of 2016 nanomotors substituted with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing (push-pull) groups. Among the the top candidates, we achieved an increase in two-photon absorption strengths of up to two orders of magnitude compared to existing nanomotors. To ensure that the pi-pi*-character of the excited state is preserved, which is necessary to achieve the required photoisomerization, we introduce a photoreactivity score, that gauges the excited state character based on the transition. Furthermore, we benchmark three machine learning (ML) models Kernel Ridge Regression, XGBoost, and a Neural Network using physical and connectivity-based molecular descriptors. The excellent accuracy of our ML predictions holds promise to replace computationally costly quantum chemistry calculations in chemical space explorations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating First-Principles Electron-Phonon Couplings: Consistency Across Methods and Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is fundamental for understanding the behavior of molecules and crystals, influencing phenomena such as charge transport, energy transfer, phase transitions, and polaron formation. Accurate computational methods to calculate EPCs from first principles are essential, but their complexity has resulted in a variety of computational strategies, raising concerns about their mutual consistency.
  In this study, we provide a systematic benchmark of methods for EPC calculation by comparing two fundamentally different {\it ab initio} methodologies. We investigate Gaussian-type orbital methods based on the \textsc{CP2K} code and plane-wave-based projector-augmented-wave (PAW) methods combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, as implemented in \textsc{VASP} and \textsc{wannier90}. In addition, we further distinguish between the derivative--of--Hamiltonian ($dH$) and derivative--of--states ($d\psi$) approaches for obtaining EPC parameters. The comparison is conducted on a representative set of organic molecules, including pyrazine, pyridine, bithiophene, and quarterthiophene, varying significantly in size and flexibility.
  We find excellent agreement across implementations and basis sets when employing the same computational approach ($dH$ or $d\psi$), demonstrating robust consistency between the numerical schemes. However, noticeable deviations occur when comparing the $dH$ and $d\psi$ approaches within each code and for specific cases discussed in detail. Our findings emphasize the reliability of EPC computations using the $dH$ method and caution against potential pitfalls associated with the $d\psi$ approach, providing guidance for future EPC calculations and model parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing adsorption configurations on alloy surfaces using Tensor Train Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases. To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt), to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized hardware.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity (II): Coherent-Incoherent Transition Driven by Photon Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in optical imaging and tracking of wave-packet propagation in optical cavities, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian polariton dynamics within a decay-tunable multimode cavity model. The complex eigen-spectrum of the model Hamiltonian allows us to predict the incoherent-coherent transition induced by photon losses, which defines an exceptional point at resonance and evolves analytically as the wavevector shifts off-resonantly. The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and relaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level repulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses the critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral characterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet dynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition; (ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii) ballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and width of the polariton wave-packet. These dynamical features have complementary symmetry between the upper-polariton (UP) branch and lower-polariton (LP) branch in the two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the photon decay rate and wavevector. Thus, the combination of complex spectral characterization and non-Hermitian wave packet propagation establishes the photon decay rate as a powerful control parameter for polariton transport, reveals the underlying symmetry in lossy cavities, and presents a starting point to incorporate other dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A unified diagrammatic formulation of single-reference and multi-reference random phase approximations: the particle-hole and particle-particle channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Chemistry on Quantum Computers: A Fault-Tolerant Algorithm with Adaptive Grids and Transcorrelated Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum computers are appealing: qubit count scales logarithmically with spatial resolution, and Coulomb operators achieve quadratic instead of quartic computational scaling of two-electron interactions. However, existing schemes employ uniform discretizations, so the resolution required to capture electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions oversamples low-density regions, wasting computational resources. We address this by deploying non-uniform, molecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is high. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is expressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that eliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both formulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation (QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart. Numerical validation on benchmark systems confirms that this non-heuristic ab initio framework offers a promising path for accurate ground-state chemistry on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Methyl Isocyanate Formation from Oxygen Insertion in Methyl Cyanide Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$, offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.</description>

      <title>Feshbach Resonances in Cold Collisions: Benchmarking State of the Art ab initio Potential Energy Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality potential energy surfaces (PES) are a prerequisite for quantitative atomistic simulations, with both quantum and classical dynamics approaches. The ultimate test for the validity of a PES are comparisons with judiciously chosen experimental observables. Here we ask whether cold collision measurements are sufficiently informative to validate and distinguish between high-level, state-of-the art PESs for the strongly interacting Ne-H$_2^+$ system. We show that measurement of the final state distributions for a process that involves only several metastable intermediate states is sufficient to identify the PES that captures the long-range interactions properly. Furthermore, we show that a modest increase in the experimental energy resolution will allow for resolving individual Feshbach resonances and enable a quantitative probe of the interactions at short and intermediate range.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11569v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, has revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Given the difficulty in monitoring and correcting the lack of energy conservation, direct forces should be used with great care. We show that the best approach to exploit the acceleration they afford is to use them in conjunction with conservative forces. A model can be pre-trained efficiently on direct forces, then fine-tuned using backpropagation. At evaluation time, both force types can be used together to avoid unphysical effects while still benefitting almost entirely from the computational efficiency of direct forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nlane) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nlane-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nlane-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through the SIE4x4 benchmark and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>

      <title>Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</description>

Abstract: We have implemented relativistic formulations of DIP-EOMCCSD and DIP-EOMCCSDT within the 1eX2C and DC-, DCG-, and DCB-X2C frameworks. Direct comparisons against full 4c-DIP-EOMCCSD calculations show excellent agreement with DC(G)-X2C-DIP-EOMCCSD, suggesting, at least for the systems studied herein, two-electron relativistic effects are well-described by the mean-field treatment in mmfX2C, and remaining relativistic two-electron and electron-positron correlation effects are negligible. A subsequent basis set study on vertical double IPs for noble gas and diatomic species has shown that DCB-X2C-DIP-EOMCCSD tends to overestimate double IP values in the limit of a complete one-electron basis, by more than 0.25 eV, on average. For atomic systems, we were able to demonstrate that a composite scheme whereby the dominant correlation effects are captured by large-basis DCB-X2C-DIP-EOMCCSD and remaining high-order correlation effects are approximately modeled via small-basis DCB-X2C-DIP-EOMCCSDT brings the double IP values into excellent agreement with experiment; for Xe atom, for example, absolute errors in double IP values from this approach are less than 0.02 eV. However, we found the ANO-RCC family of basis sets used in our composite approach to have poor convergence behavior in terms of DCB-X2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations, as the estimates computed using the non-relativistic DIP-EOMCC approach at the large basis set limit indicates a larger 0.1--0.2 eV error relative to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear Spin-Flip TDDFT for Potential Energy Surface Crossings: Conical Intersections and Spin Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently proposed a scheme to generalize collinear functionals to the noncollinear regime, termed the multicollinear approach. The resulting noncollinear functionals preserve spin symmetry while providing numerically stable higher-order functional derivatives. This scheme has already been applied to noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT and its analytic gradient calculations. In the present work, with the aid of the penalty function method, we employ the noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT in multicollinear scheme to locate potential energy surface crossings. We investigate two distinct types of crossings and analyze their topographical and spin characteristics near the crossing points. The first type is conical intersections, typically involving two singlet states such as the ground and first excited states. The second type involves spin crossings that occur between electronic states with different spin multiplicities, such as between singlet and triplet. These crossing regions enable ultrafast nonadiabatic transitions through either nonadiabatic coupling or spin-orbit coupling, playing a crucial role in photochemistry. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, we demonstrate the advantages of noncollinear spin-flip TDDFT over conventional collinear spin-flip TDDFT or spin-conserving TDDFT. Finally, we systematically evaluate its prospects as an electronic structure method for use in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Quantum Dynamics of He$_2$ over the b~$^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c~$^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ Electronic Subspace by including Non-adiabatic, Relativistic and QED Corrections and Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-wide GaN/AlGaN quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm wide GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Jeff = 1/2 Diamond Magnet CaCo2TeO6: A Pathway toward New Spin Physics and Quantum Functions</title>

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</description>

      <title>Taylor-mode automatic differentiation for constructing molecular rovibrational Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an automated framework for constructing Taylor series expansions of rovibrational kinetic and potential energy operators for arbitrary molecules, internal coordinate systems, and molecular frame embedding conditions. Expressing operators in a sum-of-products form allows for computationally efficient evaluations of matrix elements in product basis sets. Our approach uses automatic differentiation tools from the Python machine learning ecosystem, particularly the JAX library, to efficiently and accurately generate high-order Taylor expansions of rovibrational operators. The implementation is available at https://github.com/robochimps/vibrojet.</description>
