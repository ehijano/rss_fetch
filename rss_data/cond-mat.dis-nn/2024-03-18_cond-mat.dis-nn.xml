      <title>New insights into the origin of the first sharp diffraction peak in amorphous silica from an analysis of chemical and radial ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about 5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Phonon predictions with E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an equivariant neural network for predicting vibrational and phonon modes of molecules and periodic crystals, respectively. These predictions are made by evaluating the second derivative Hessian matrices of the learned energy model that is trained with the energy and force data. Using this method, we are able to efficiently predict phonon dispersion and the density of states for inorganic crystal materials. For molecules, we also derive the symmetry constraints for IR/Raman active modes by analyzing the phonon mode irreducible representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that using Hessian as a new type of higher-order training data improves energy models beyond models that only use lower-order energy and force data. With this second derivative approach, one can directly relate the energy models to the experimental observations for the vibrational properties. This approach further connects to a broader class of physical observables with a generalized energy model that includes external fields.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Bottlenecks in Quantum Annealing and Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Paramagnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems, the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Scattering Zero Degeneracies for Spectral Management of Coherent Perfect Absorption in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA) protocol for cases where scale invariance is violated due to the presence of nonlinear mechanisms. We demonstrate, using a microwave setting that lacks geometrical symmetries, that the nonlinearity offers new reconfigurable modalities: the destruction or formation of nonlinear CPAs (NL-CPAs), and their frequency positioning and bandwidth management using the incident power as a control knob. The latter occurs via the formation of exceptional point degeneracies of the zeroes of nonlinear scattering processes. Our results establish NL-CPA protocols as a versatile scheme for the creation of reconfigurable hot/cold-spots in complicated enclosures (e.g. buildings or vessels) with applications to next-generation telecommunications, long-range wireless power transfer, and electromagnetic warfare.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Liquid Crossover in Water Model: Local Structure vs. Kinetics of Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In equilibrium and supercooled liquids, polymorphism is manifested by thermodynamic regions defined in the phase diagram, which are predominantly of different short- and medium-range order (local structure). It is found that on the phase diagram of the water model, the thermodynamic region corresponding to the equilibrium liquid phase is divided by a line of the smooth liquid-liquid crossover. In the case of the water model, this crossover is revealed by various local order parameters and corresponds to pressures of the order of $3\,150 \pm 350$ atm at ambient temperature. In the vicinity of the crossover, the dynamics of water molecules change significantly, which is reflected, in particular, in the fact that the self-diffusion coefficient reaches its maximum values. In addition, changes in the structure also manifest themselves in changes in the kinetics of hydrogen bonding, which is captured by values of such the quantities as the average lifetime of hydrogen bonding, the average lifetimes of different local coordination numbers, and the frequencies of changes in different local coordination numbers. An interpretation of the hydrogen bond kinetics in terms of the free energy landscape concept in the space of possible coordination numbers is proposed.</description>

      <title>Beyond May: Complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex -- and, by and large, stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in the light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are in fact two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing. Our result shows that May's principle that "complexity begets instability" is not a general property of complex systems; instead, it is a property of a subclass of weakly cross-regulated disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Carrier confinement and alloy disorder exacerbate Auger-Meitner recombination in AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum efficiency of AlGaN ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) declines (droops) at increasing operating powers due to Auger-Meitner recombination (AMR). Using first-principles density-functional theory, we show that indirect AMR mediated by electron-phonon coupling and alloy disorder can induce bulk $C$ coefficients as large as $\sim10^{-31}$ cm$^6$/s. Furthermore, we find that the confinement of carriers by polarization fields within quantum wells severely relaxes crystal-momentum conservation, which exacerbates the rate of AMR over radiative recombination by an order of magnitude relative to the bulk. This results in a striking decrease in quantum efficiency at high power. Suppressing polarization fields and jointly increasing the well width would greatly mitigate AMR and efficiency droop.</description>

Abstract: It has been proposed that random wide neural networks near Gaussian process are quantum field theories around Gaussian fixed points. In this paper, we provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be cast into the form of a neural network with a statistical summation over network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman's path integral. The map can be applied to interacting quantum systems / field theories, even away from the Gaussian limit. Our findings bring machine learning closer to the quantum world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Replica Field Theory for a Generalized Franz--Parisi Potential of Inhomogeneous Glassy Systems: New Closure and the Associated Self-Consistent Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On approaching the dynamical transition temperature, supercooled liquids show heterogeneity over space and time. Static replica theory investigates the dynamical crossover in terms of the free energy landscape (FEL). Two kinds of static approaches have provided a self-consistent equation for determining this crossover, similar to the mode coupling theory for glassy dynamics. One uses the Morita-Hiroike formalism of the liquid state theory, whereas the other relies on the density functional theory (DFT). Each of the two approaches has advantages in terms of perturbative field theory. Here, we develop a replica field theory that has the benefits from both formulations. We introduce the generalized Franz-Parisi potential to formulate a correlation functional. Considering fluctuations around an inhomogeneous density determined by the Ramakrishnan--Yussouf DFT, we find a new closure as the stability condition of the correlation functional. The closure leads to the self-consistent equation involving the triplet direct correlation function. The present field theory further helps us study the FEL beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dielectric Properties in Models of Amorphous Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a theoretical study of dielectric properties of models of amorphous Boron Nitride, using interatomic potentials generated by machine learning. We first perform first-principles simulations on small (about $100$ atoms in the periodic cell) sample sizes to explore the emergence of mid-gap states and its correlation with structural features. Next, by using a simplified tight-binding electronic model, we analyse the dielectric functions for complex three dimensional models (containing about $10.000$ atoms) embedding varying concentrations of ${\rm sp^{1}, sp^{2}}$ and ${\rm sp^3}$ bonds between B and N atoms. Within the limits of these methodologies, the resulting value of the zero-frequency dielectric constant is shown to be influenced by the population density of such mid-gap states and their localization characteristics. We observe nontrivial correlations between the structure-induced electronic fluctuations and the resulting dielectric constant values. Our findings are however just a first step in the quest of accessing fully accurate dielectric properties of as-grown amorphous BN of relevance for interconnect technologies and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Many-body localized phases retain memory of their initial conditions in disordered interacting systems with unitary dynamics. The stability of the localized phase due to the breakdown of unitarity is of relevance to experiment in the presence of dissipation. Here we investigate the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on many-body localization. We focus on the interacting Hatano-Nelson model which breaks unitarity via asymmetric hopping. We explore the phase diagram for the mid-spectrum eigenstates as a function of the interaction strength and the non-Hermiticity. In contrast to the non-interacting case, our findings are consistent with a two-step approach to the localized regime. We also study the dynamics of the particle imbalance. We show that the distribution of relaxation time scales differs qualitatively between the localized and ergodic phases. Our findings suggest the possibility of an intermediate dynamical regime in disordered open systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of Neural-Network Quantum States (NQS) have made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional or bi-directional NHSE and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase, the winding number, and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo with Large Patched Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models, like transformers, have recently demonstrated immense powers in text and image generation. This success is driven by the ability to capture long-range correlations between elements in a sequence. The same feature makes the transformer a powerful wavefunction ansatz that addresses the challenge of describing correlations in simulations of qubit systems. Here we consider two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays to demonstrate that transformers reach higher accuracies than conventional recurrent neural networks for variational ground state searches. We further introduce large, patched transformer models, which consider a sequence of large atom patches, and show that this architecture significantly accelerates the simulations. The proposed architectures reconstruct ground states with accuracies beyond state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods, allowing for the study of large Rydberg systems in different phases of matter and at phase transitions. Our high-accuracy ground state representations at reasonable computational costs promise new insights into general large-scale quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transition for free fermions above one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition for free-fermion models in $d&gt;1$ dimensions is developed. The critical point separates a gapless phase with $\ell^{d-1} \ln \ell$ scaling of the second cumulant of the particle number and of the entanglement entropy and an area-law phase with $\ell^{d-1}$ scaling, where $\ell$ is a size of the subsystem. The problem is mapped onto an SU($R$) replica non-linear sigma model in $d+1$ dimensions, with $R\to 1$. Using renormalization-group analysis, we calculate critical indices in one-loop approximation justified for $d = 1+ \epsilon$ with $\epsilon \ll 1$. Further, we carry out a numerical study of the transition for a $d=2$ model on a square lattice, determine numerically the critical point, and estimate the critical index of the correlation length, $\nu \approx 1.4$.</description>
