      <title>Good Data and Bad Data: The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask when additional data collection by a monopolist to engage in price discrimination monotonically increases or decreases weighted surplus. To answer this question, we develop a model to study endogenous market segmentation subject to residual uncertainty. We give a complete characterization of when data collection is good or bad for surplus, which consists of a reduction of the problem to one with only two demand curves, and a condition for the two-demand-curves case that highlights three distinct effects of information on welfare. These results provide insights into when data collection and usage for price discrimination should be allowed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Reform and Development Pathways of AIIB's Climate Accountability Mechanism in the Context of Global Climate Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) revised its Environmental and Social Framework, it has committed to certain climate-related objectives, yet an independent climate accountability mechanism has not been established. The absence of clear evaluation principles and procedural rules presents challenges in effectively addressing environmental investment disputes. This article reviews both domestic and international literature related to AIIB's climate accountability mechanism, identifying that the current Environmental and Social Framework's principled content and reliance on traditional approaches have resulted in issues of enforceability and the absence of an independent accountability institution. To enhance the effectiveness of AIIB's climate accountability mechanism, a reassessment of its development path is necessary. Future developments should transition from an additive path to a substitutive path, focusing on the application of international environmental and social standards, increasing stakeholder recognition and participation, promoting comprehensive reforms within AIIB, and establishing a coordinated independent accountability system. These measures aim to support the robust development of AIIB's climate accountability mechanism.</description>

      <title>Developing a Climate Litigation Framework: China's Contribution to International Environmental Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although "climate litigation" is not an indigenous term in China, localizing it is essential to support the development of an independent environmental legal knowledge system in China. Rooted in China's judicial tradition, which emphasizes substantive rationality, traditional legal theories have primarily focused on environmental law. However, the contemporary practices in the rule of law have created an unclear trajectory for climate litigation. Research in this area has long been trapped in a paradigm that relies on lawsuits for ecological environmental damage compensation and environmental public interest litigation, leading to a significant disconnect between theoretical frameworks and practical application. With the advancement of the "dual carbon" strategic goals-carbon peaking and carbon neutrality-it has become imperative to redefine the concept of climate litigation within the Chinese context. We need to establish a theoretical framework that aligns with the "dual carbon" objectives while providing theoretical and institutional support for climate litigation, ultimately contributing to the international discourse on climate justice. Additionally, Hong Kong's proactive climate governance and robust ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices provide valuable insights for developing comprehensive climate litigation mechanisms. Based on this analysis, we propose concrete plans for building a climate litigation system in China, establishing a preventive relief system and a multi-source legal framework at the substantive level and developing climate judicial mechanisms for mitigation and adaptation at the procedural level.</description>

      <title>Preference graphs: a combinatorial tool for game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preference graph is a combinatorial representation of the structure of a normal-form game. Its nodes are the strategy profiles, with an arc between profiles if they differ in the strategy of a single player, where the orientation indicates the preferred choice for that player. We show that the preference graph is a surprisingly fundamental tool for studying normal-form games, which arises from natural axioms and which underlies many key game-theoretic concepts, including dominated strategies and strict Nash equilibria, as well as classes of games like potential games, supermodular games and weakly acyclic games. The preference graph is especially related to game dynamics, playing a significant role in the behaviour of fictitious play and the replicator dynamic. Overall, we aim to equip game theorists with the tools and understanding to apply the preference graph to new problems in game theory.</description>

      <title>Price Heterogeneity as a source of Heterogenous Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore heterogenous prices as a source of heterogenous or stochastic demand. Heterogenous prices could arise either because there is actual price variation among consumers or because consumers (mis)perceive prices differently. Our main result says the following: if heterogenous prices have a distribution among consumers that is (in a sense) stable across observations, then a model where consumers have a common utility function but face heterogenous prices has precisely the same implications as a heterogenous preference/random utility model (with no price heterogeneity)</description>

      <title>Incentives and Strategic Behaviour: An Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How and why do incentive levels affect strategic behaviour? This paper examines an experiment designed to identify the causal effect of scaling up incentives on choices, beliefs, and response times in dominance-solvable games. Higher incentives increase action sophistication and decrease mistake propensity, while beliefs become more accurate, and response times longer. We provide evidence that higher incentives increase cognitive effort, as proxied by longer response times, which in turn is associated with improved performance and predicts choice sophistication and belief accuracy. Overall, the data lend support to both payoff-dependent mistakes and costly reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Expert Classification Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem where a set of individuals has to classify $m$ objects into $p$ categories by aggregating the individual classifications, and no category can be left empty. An aggregator satisfies \emph{Expertise} if individuals are decisive either over the classification of a given object, or the classification into a given category. We show that requiring an aggregator to satisfy \emph{Expertise} (or variants of it) and be either unanimous or independent leads to numerous impossibility results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Segmentation of Search Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider a two-sided frictional search market where buyers search and match to vertically differentiated sellers. The market is segmented into submarkets based on seller types, with segmentation serving as a public signal that directs buyers' search. I characterize the socially efficient and equilibrium allocations of buyers across submarkets for any fixed segmentation, and identify a Hosios condition under which the equilibrium allocation is efficient. I further examine the design of surplus-maximizing segmentations, demonstrating the role of search externalities in determining whether the constrained-efficient segmentation fully reveals seller types or pools types into at most a binary partition. These results clarify the conditions under which the provision of public information is welfare enhancing in search markets with externalities.</description>
