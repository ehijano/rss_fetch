      <title>ScAtt: an Attention based architecture to analyze Alzheimer's disease at cell type level from single-cell RNA-sequencing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory and behavior impairment severe enough to interfere with daily life activities. Understanding this disease pathogenesis can drive the development of new targets and strategies to prevent and treat AD. Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) have enabled the generation of massive amounts of transcriptomic data at the single-cell level provided remarkable insights into understanding the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we introduce ScAtt, an innovative Attention-based architecture, devised specifically for the concurrent identification of cell-type specific AD-related genes and their associated gene regulatory network. ScAtt incorporates a flexible model capable of capturing nonlinear effects, leading to the detection of AD-associated genes that might be overlooked by traditional differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses. Moreover, ScAtt effectively infers a gene regulatory network depicting the combined influences of genes on the targeted disease, as opposed to examining correlations among genes in conventional gene co-expression networks. In an application to 95,186 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 17 hippocampus samples, ScAtt shows substantially better performance in modeling quantitative changes in expression levels between AD and healthy controls. Consequently, ScAtt performs better than existing methods in the identification of AD-related genes, with more unique discoveries and less overlap between cell types. Functional enrichments of the corresponding gene modules detected from gene regulatory network show significant enrichment of biologically meaningful AD-related pathways across different cell types.</description>

      <title>Elementary Flux Modes as CRN Gears for Free Energy Transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, for a chemical reaction network (CRN) engaged in energy transduction, its optimal operation from a thermodynamic efficiency standpoint is contingent upon its working conditions. Analogously to the bicycle gear system, CRNs have at their disposal several transducing mechanisms characterized by different yields. We highlight the critical role of the CRN's elementary flux modes in determining this "gearing" and their impact on maximizing energy transduction efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an enzymatically regulated CRN, engineered to autonomously adjust its "gear", thereby optimizing its efficiency under different external conditions.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the construction and evolution of mathematical models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, structuring the discussion into two distinct historical phases of modeling strategies: extension and reduction. The extension phase explores the bottom-up assembly of regulatory networks introducing as many components and interactions as possible in order to capture the oscillatory nature of the clock. The reduction phase deals with functional decomposition, distilling complex models to their essential dynamical repertoire. Current challenges in this field, including the integration of spatial considerations and environmental influences like light and temperature, are also discussed. The review emphasizes the ongoing need for models that balance molecular detail with practical simplicity.</description>
