      <title>Quasiparticle Interference in LiFeAs: Signature of Inelastic Tunneling through Spin Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample. Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Chiral Superfluids with a Complex Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the influence of dissipation on a quantum system has attracted much attention, particularly on how the non-Hermitian terms modify the energy spectrum, band topology, and phase transition point. Motivated by the recent investigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the non-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction, originating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the non-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in the path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain the phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the reentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the evolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher partial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further consider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the influence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology associated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation. Besides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are pure real. We further verify the conditions of zero winding number in (quasi-) one-dimensional systems, and prove an associated ``no-go'' theorem, which is hopefully applied to explore the geometry dependent skin effect.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity evidence for quantum criticality in clean infinite-layer nickelate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Andreev crystals in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring superconductors, these bands are {\it directional}: one band consists only of right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction.</description>

      <title>Charge-4$e$ Anyon Superconductor from Doping $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid can emerge in the SU($4$) Hubbard model on triangular lattice. A natural question then arises: What is the phase upon doping? In this work, we show the possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge $c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Fermi velocity and magic angle renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model. Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and $U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from $1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta&gt;\theta_{max}$, $T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For $\theta&lt;\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.</description>

      <title>Spin-triplet pair density wave superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully gapped and realizes a class-DIII topological superconductor, characterized by two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interaction originating from Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under pressure in 18%-S substituted FeSe studied via NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: S-substituted FeSe superconductors in the tetragonal phase display several unique features among iron-based superconductors, particularly the presence of zero-energy excitations in the superconducting (SC) state. The recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system.</description>

      <title>The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</description>
