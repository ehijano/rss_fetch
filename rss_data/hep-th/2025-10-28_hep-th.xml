      <title>A gauge invariant Hamiltonian evolution across the black hole horizon in asymptotically AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a probe scalar field in the background of a black hole in AAdS spacetime in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity in the maximal slicing gauge. The black hole solution in this gauge is expressed in terms of wormhole coordinates, a smooth coordinate system with constant time slices that cut across the horizon, and asymptote to the Killing time slices at the boundaries.
  The quantum scalar field is expanded in terms of normalized solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, that are valid at all points in spacetime. The operators that appear in the expansion are in the product space of the CFTs on the two spacetime boundaries, which are by definition gauge invariant under small bulk diffeomorphisms. The entangled Hartle-Hawking (HH) state arises naturally from this construction.
  One of our main results is a well defined formula for the time dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian of the probe scalar in the product space of the two CFTs, which describes the time development of operators/states along the maximal slices. This Hamiltonian acting on the HH state creates a state of finite norm. Consequently there is a unitary description of horizon crossing scalar field excitations on top of the HH state. We also present a bulk reconstruction formula that evaluates an order parameter that signals horizon crossing in the boundary theory.
  We calculate various bulk Wightman two-point functions on the two-sided BTZ black hole. We recover Hawking's thermodynamic results in the exterior region when expressed in terms of BTZ coordinates that are related to the wormhole coordinates by a singular transformation. We compute the two-point function with one insertion in the future/past interior and the other in the exterior. Both are related by a time reflection symmetry and asymptote to a non-zero constant as the coordinate time between the two points becomes large.</description>

      <title>Constrained instantons in scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantons, localised saddle points of the action, play an important role in describing non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories, for example vacuum decay or violation of conservation laws associated with anomalous symmetries. However, there are theories in which no saddle point exists. In this paper, we revisit the idea of constrained instantons, proposed initially by Affleck in 1981, and develop it into a complete method for computing the vacuum decay rate in such cases. We apply this approach to the massive scalar field theory with a negative quartic self-interaction using two different constraints. We solve the field equations numerically and find a two-branch structure, with two distinct solutions for each value of the constraint. By counting the negative modes, we identify one branch of solutions as the constrained instantons and the other as the minima of the action subject to the constraint. We discuss their significance for the computation of the vacuum decay rate.</description>

      <title>2+1 dimensional gravity in AAdS spacetimes with spatial wormhole slices: Reduced phase space dynamics and the BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve Einstein's equations with negative cosmological constant in $2+1$ dimensions in the Hamiltonian formulation. The spacetime has the topology of $\Sigma \times \mathbf{R}$ where $\mathbf{R}$ corresponds to the time direction and $\Sigma$ is a cylinder $\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{S}^1$ and the spacetime metric satisfies asymptotically AdS (AAdS) boundary conditions.
  We address the question of gauge invariance by fixing the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic gauge conditions and demonstrate that there are no residual small diffeomorphisms in this gauge. We explicitly solve the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, and the gauge conditions to obtain a two dimensional reduced phase space. For simplicity, and with the BTZ black hole in mind, we restrict the solution of the momentum constraints to be independent of $\mathbf{S}^1$.
  In AAdS spacetimes besides the standard Wheeler-deWitt equations there is a Schroedinger equation corresponding to the boundary ADM Hamiltonian. We express this Hamiltonian in terms of the reduced phase space variables and discuss its classical solutions and quantization. We exhibit the wave functions and a continuous positive energy spectrum. Each energy eigenvalue $E$ corresponds to a BTZ black hole of mass $M=E/2$. This identification is based on the fact that the classical solution of the reduced phase space dynamics gives rise to a spacetime that is related to the two-sided BTZ black hole by a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Islands and traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information recovery in black hole evaporation using traversable wormhole protocols in AdS$_2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter fields coupled to an external bath. By introducing a simple non-local interaction between left and right radiation regions, we generate negative-energy shockwaves that render the wormhole traversable. We compute the resulting shifts in Kruskal coordinates, changes in the stress tensor, and backreaction effects on quantum extremal surfaces, finding a consistent decrease of the generalized entropy that aligns with the flat Page curve. Finally, we analyze the impact of negative-energy shocks on boundary two-point functions, providing a microscopic probe of island/radiation duality and discussing possible implications for experimental realizations in analog quantum-mechanical models.</description>

      <title>A String Theory for Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work we proposed a string theory dual to two dimensional Yang-Mills theory at zero coupling (which can also be thought of as a $BF$ theory), given by a Polyakov-like generalization of Ho\v rava's topological rigid string theory, and we showed that it correctly reproduces (in the $1/N$ expansion) several partition functions of $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. In the present paper, we generalise this to Wilson loop expectation values by adding boundaries with one Dirichlet and one Neumann boundary condition to our string worldsheets. We discuss in detail several examples, including examples where the worldsheet has branch points or orientation-reversing tubes, or where the Wilson loop has one or more self-intersections, and we show that in all of them the string theory reproduces the known Yang-Mills expectation values. We argue that examples with orientation-reversing tubes or self-intersecting Wilson loops cannot be brought to the conformal gauge, so we analyse them in a different gauge.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theories with BRST instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories, when suitably coupled to Higgs-like fields, admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields in a non-trivial neighborhood of the minima moduli. In the adjoint representation, BRST instability is present beyond tree-level, and closely resembles the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The fundamental representation requires realification $SU(N) \hookrightarrow SO(2N)$, but exhibits a more pronounced instability at tree-level. Stable topological solitons (vertices/monopoles) are generically present in the adjoint case. These instabilities indicate the reintroduction of local degrees of freedom into the physical spectrum of these topological field theories. In particular, the realified fundamental case may provide a promising framework for 4d topological gravity models. In addition, our results offer rare examples of BRST symmetry breaking in non-Abelian gauge theories with trivial Gribov problems.</description>

      <title>Collective Theory at Finite-$N$: Reduction of the Emergent Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing the formulation of finite $N$ Hilbert spaces in emergent theories we study in this work $S_{N}$ symmetric collective models. For the case of $N$ bosons in $d$ dimensions, which map to matrix models with commuting matrices, we describe a complete algorithm and give a detailed case study reproducing the expected primaries and determining secondary invariants at each bidegree (a Hironaka decomposition). The method is based on null spaces (of the full collective theory) which are seen to yield all the independent trace relations, reducing the construction to linear algebra. As a stringent check, of our algorithm, we have verified that the system of invariants generates a subset of gauge invariant operators with no redundancies. This results in a reduction of the Hilbert space, in particular the gauge invariant secondary invariants realize an emergent Fock space with finite-$N$ occupation-numbers.</description>

      <title>Causality of higher-spin interactions on the (A)dS lightcone, with application to the static patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Higher-Spin Gravity in 4-dimensional (Anti-)de Sitter space, at leading order in the interactions (cubic vertices), in the AdS lightcone formalism developed by Metsaev. Using the vertices' chiral structure, we extend the formalism into a broader class of lightcone frames, which allows for lightcones of bulk points. This enables us to write the lightcone theory in de Sitter space, where only these more general frames are available. It also allows us to formulate and verify (for the first time!) some causal properties of massless higher-spin interactions, involving lightcone foliations that share a lightray. These causal properties serve to both motivate and enable the computation of "static-patch scattering amplitudes" - the evolution of fields between the two horizons of the maximal observable region in de Sitter space. We present a computation scheme for such "amplitudes" in coordinate space, and in momentum space with spinor-helicity variables.</description>

      <title>Constrained Pad\'e Ensembles for Thermal N=4 SYM: Quantified Uncertainties and Next-Order Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the transition between weak and strong coupling in thermal $\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in four space-time dimensions by constructing an \emph{admissible ensemble} of log-aware Pad\'e approximants that exactly reproduce the weak- and strong-coupling expansions through $\mathcal O(\lambda^2)$ and $\mathcal O(\lambda^{-3/2})$ (where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling), including the nonanalytic $\lambda^{3/2}$ and $\lambda^{2}\log\lambda$ terms. This replaces single-curve estimates with a reproducible uncertainty band and a well-defined central curve across the intermediate regime. Applying the same construction to transport, the $\eta/s$ band connects perturbative behavior to the Kovtun-Son-Starinets limit. The framework is \emph{predictive}, yielding $A_{5/2}=0.476\pm0.095$ on the weak side and a model-independent bound on the next strong-coupling term, thereby setting testable benchmarks for forthcoming perturbative and holographic calculations.</description>

      <title>Pinched geometries in $\mathbf{2}$D Lorentzian quantum Regge calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate pinched geometries in a two-dimensional Lorentzian model of quantum Regge calculus (QRC) using the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. A pinched geometry refers to a configuration with an infinitely long temporal extent, even when the total spacetime area is fixed. We examine several choices of integration measures and triangulations to study whether such geometries can dominate in the limit of infinitely many triangles. Our results indicate that pinched geometries are strongly suppressed, and this suppression is observed across different integral measures and triangulations. These results suggest the possible emergence of smooth geometries as well as a sort of universality for infinitely many triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive several new quantum bit thread prescriptions for holographic entanglement entropy, equivalent for static states to the quantum extremal surface formula. Our new prescriptions come in many varieties: vector field-based or based on measures over bulk curves, dependent or independent of the bulk UV regulator, loose and strict versions of constraints, and more. We also explore how bit threads behave in the presence of entanglement islands and baby universes. Finally, our prescriptions inspire new measures of entanglement that we call entanglement distribution functions, which can be packaged into a convex polytope that we call the entropohedron.</description>

      <title>Toward Krylov-based holography in double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the duality between Krylov complexity and geodesic length in Jackiw-Teitelboim and sine-dilaton gravity, we develop a precise holographic dictionary for quantities in the Krylov subspace of the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK). First, we demonstrate that the growth rate of Krylov state complexity corresponds to the wormhole velocity, and show that its expectation value in coherent states serves as a boundary diagnostic of firewall-like structures via bulk reconstruction. We also delineate an alternative bulk description in terms of the proper momentum of an infalling particle at early times, establishing a threefold duality between the Krylov complexity growth rate, wormhole velocity, and proper momentum, with clear regimes of validity. Beyond the first moments, we argue that higher-order Krylov complexities capture connected bulk contributions encoded by replica wormholes, while the logarithmic variant probes the replica saddle structure. Finally, within a third-quantized setting incorporating baby universes, we show that the Krylov entropy equals the von Neumann entropy of the parent-geometry density matrix obtained after tracing out baby universes, thereby quantifying information flow into the baby universe sector. Together, these results elevate Krylov-space observables to sharp probes of bulk dynamics and topology in ensemble-averaged 2D gravity.</description>

      <title>Local gauge invariant operator on isometry breaking background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas local field operators play the crucial role in reconciling quantum mechanics and special relativity, they are not trivially compatible with the diffeomorphism invariance of gravity. In order to address this issue, we consider the background geometry which breaks the isometry spontaneously. Then the local gauge invariant operator can be constructed through the St\"uckelberg mechanism, where the fluctuation of the metric in the direction of the isometry breaking combines with that of matter whose classical solution breaks the isometry. This is equivalent to introducing the clock and the rod to promote the local field operators to the gauge invariant ones. A typical example is the curvature perturbation in quasi-de Sitter space arising from the spontaneous breaking of the timelike isometry. We also discuss the features of the local gauge invariant operator when the spacelike isometry is spontaneously broken. Meanwhile, even if the local gauge invariant operators exist, it does not guarantee the reliable construction of the gauge invariant operators on the local region like the island, which is regarded as an essential ingredient to resolve the black hole information paradox. This is because the fluctuation of the spacetime point is accumulated in time, which in fact also gives rise to eternal inflation in quasi-de Sitter space. In order to suppress the fluctuation at late time, the isometry must be strongly broken by the background. In the case of the evaporating black hole, it may be achieved by the transition to the higher dimensional black hole.</description>

      <title>A study of string theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation consists of a comprehensive and pedagogical review of Maldacena's original derivation of the AdS/CFT correspondence and the main topics of string theory necessary to understand it. The large $N$ expansion of Yang-Mills theory is presented as the main motivation for seeking a string-theoretic language for gauge theories. The bosonic string is studied in conformal gauge, with an emphasis on the spectrum and the low energy effective actions for both closed and open strings. The properties of D-branes are studied via T-duality, and closed-open string duality is checked by explicitly computing the interaction amplitude between two D-branes. The type II superstring theories are studied in the RNS formalism and their massless spectrum is shown to match that of the type II ten-dimensional supergravity theories. Supersymmetric branes are discussed, including their realization as supergravity solitons, and the original derivation of the AdS/CFT duality is presented. Some of the properties of the correspondence are discussed, including the idea of the holographic dictionary.</description>

      <title>The anomalous spin-statistics connection arising from pseudo-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new spin-statistics theorem for a class of free pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories whose particles furnish unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'{e} group. In this framework, free pseudo-Hermitian fields with integer spin exhibit fermionic statistics, whereas those with half-integer spin exhibit bosonic statistics, opposite to the conventional case. This reversal arises from defining canonical field operators using pseudo-Hermitian conjugation rather than Hermitian conjugation, thereby circumventing the conventional spin-statistics theorem. The free fields retain locality, Lorentz covariance, and unitary evolution. However, interactions may violate unitarity due to the intrinsically non-Hermitian nature of the full Hamiltonian. We discuss potential resolutions to restore unitarity in interacting theories.</description>

      <title>Double copy and the double Poisson bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive first-order and second-order field equations from ambitwistor spaces as phase spaces of massless particles. In particular, the second-order field equations of Yang-Mills theory and general relativity are formulated in a unified form $\{\{H,H\}\}_\nabla = 0$, whose left-hand side describes a doubling of Poisson bracket in a covariant sense. This structure originates from a one-loop diagram encoded in gauge-covariant, associative operator products on the ambitwistor worldlines. A conjecture arises that the kinematic algebra might manifest as the Poisson algebra of ambitwistor space.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief introduction into the gauge invariant formulation of irreducible massive bosonic higher spin fields. We discuss both free Lagrangians and the ones which include cubic interactions. We demonstrate an application of these Lagrangians to a description of the interactions between Kerr black holes in a Post Minkowskian approximation.</description>

      <title>Minimal Weak Gravity Conjecture And Gauge Duality in M-theory on K3xT2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) predicts the emergence of towers of superextremal states in both weak and strong coupling limits. In this work, we study M-theory compactified on a special class of Calabi-Yau threefolds to construct a 5D effective field theory (EFT) that accommodates both weak and strong gauge coupling limits. Building on a classification of fiber structures of Calabi-Yau threefolds with finite volume, we establish a correspondence between curves in the fiber and the base, which relates weak and strong gauge couplings. This allows us to probe non-perturbative effects by treating strong couplings through their weakly counterparts. We use this result and properties of Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states to demonstrate that M-theory on such Calabi-Yau threefold exhibits towers of superextremal BPS states in the aforementioned extreme limits as expected by the minimal WGC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition of Dark Solitons in Spherical Holographic Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23331v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ, for the first time, the holographic gravity approach to investigate the dynamical stability of solitons in spherical superfluids. Transverse perturbations are applied to the background of spherical soliton configurations, and the collective excitation modes of the solitons are examined within the framework of linear analysis. Our study reveals the existence of two distinct unstable modes in the soliton configurations. Through fully nonlinear evolution schemes, the dynamical evolution and final states of the solitons are elucidated. The results demonstrate that the solitons exhibit both self-acceleration instability and snake instability at different temperatures, respectively. And we explore the corresponding temperature-dependent dynamical phase transitions. It is noteworthy that the dynamical behavior of spherical solitons is distinct from the planar case due to the presence of spherical curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider expansions for the kernels of operator functions of second-order minimal operators on a curved background. We show that the terms of these expansions originate in the ultraviolet or infrared regions. We propose a systematic approach to obtaining ultraviolet terms using term-by-term integration of the DeWitt expansion of the heat kernel. We discuss two methods for regularizing infrared divergences arising at intermediate computational steps -- using analytic continuation and introducing a mass term -- and the relationship between them.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from a String-Inspired Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between string theory and early-universe cosmology offers promising avenues to explore high-energy regimes where the standard single-field slow-roll model may no longer provide an accurate description. One intriguing scenario emerges from certain non-supersymmetric string models, where supersymmetry breaking induces a non-trivial vacuum energy, or more precisely an exponential potential for scalar fields, and primarily for the dilaton. This setup gives rise to the so-called "climbing scalar" phenomenon, whereby the scalar is forced to emerge from the initial singularity while climbing up the potential, if sufficiently steep. This phase precedes a turning point, and the subsequent descent can support inflation. The resulting pre-inflationary dynamics can leave imprints in cosmological observables. To begin with, it induces a low-frequency cut in the primordial power spectrum that resonates with the lack of power present in the first few CMB multipoles. The main theme of this work is to clarify its possible effect on non-Gaussianities.</description>

      <title>Many-body chaos and pole-skipping in holographic charged rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution.</description>

      <title>Newtonian Gravity Can Produce Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we combine the key ingredient for preparing quantum bodies from superposed mass distributions with the post-Newtonian approach to obtain an effective field theory of quantum bodies, thereby addressing the question of whether classical gravity can produce quantum entanglement. In this framework, we find that the effective theory is a two-qubit interaction with a coupling given by the Newtonian nonlocal quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. This non-local coupling produces the entanglement between quantum bodies.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Baryogenesis with \texttt{BARYONET}: a self-contained review of the WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code \texttt{BARYONET}. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it.
  We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting \texttt{BARYONET} implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications.
  In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$\emph{diffusion constants}, \emph{Yukawa/helicity-flip rates}, and \emph{strong/weak sphaleron rates}$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity with out-of-equilibrium corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how out-of-equilibrium effects modify the steady-state propagation of bubble walls during a cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition. Going beyond the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we numerically solve the coupled system of scalar field, hydrodynamic and Boltzmann equations using a spectral algorithm that allows a first-principle treatment of the collision integral. This approach enables a quantitative assessment of non-equilibrium perturbations in the plasma and their backreaction on the wall motion. Focusing on the singlet extension of the Standard Model as a minimal benchmark scenario, we find that out-of-equilibrium corrections substantially enhance the effective friction on the expanding front, leading to slower wall velocities and broader wall profiles compared to the equilibrium case. These modifications have significant implications for cosmological observables. For instance, they enhance the efficiency of electroweak baryogenesis, thus improving the viability of baryon asymmetry generation within realistic parameter regions that can also be probed by future gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy using DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological implications of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) Lyman-$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with complementary datasets DESI DR2 galaxy BAO, Type Ia supernova (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, and Union3), and compressed CMB likelihood. We test several dynamical dark energy models CPL, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE as well as $\omega$CDM and non-flat extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models. Using the Metropolis Hastings MCMC algorithm implemented in \texttt{SimpleMC}, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each model and evaluate the Bayesian evidence using \texttt{MCEvidence} to assess each model's performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that the inclusion of DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ data modestly enhances sensitivity to departures from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show non-flat extensions remain consistent with spatial flatness ($\Omega_k \approx 0$ within $1$-$2\sigma$). Further, all redshift dependent dark energy models predict $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$, favor a dynamical dark energy scenario characterized by Quintom-B type, and we found that dynamical dark energy favors over the $\Lambda$CDM model ranging from 0.24-2.60$\sigma$, depending on the choice of model and corresponding combination of datasets. Bayesian evidence comparison favors the $\omega$CDM model with moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM, whereas other parameterizations remain statistically inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the Center of Momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <title>A Quasigroup Approach for Conservation Laws in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the quasigroup approach to conservation laws in general relativity, we show how the infinite-parametric Newman-Unti group of asymptotic symmetries can be reduced to the Poincare quasigroup. We compute Noether's charges associated with any element of the Poincare quasialgebra. The integral conserved quantities of energy momentum and angular momentum, being linear on generators of the Poincare quasigroup, are identically equal to zero in Minkowski spacetime. We present a definition of the angular momentum free of the supertranslation ambiguity. We provide an appropriate notion of intrinsic angular momentum and a description of the mass reference frame's center at future null infinity. Finally, in the center of mass reference frame, the momentum and angular momentum are defined by the Komar expression.</description>

      <title>A Two-HCIZ Gaussian Matrix Model for Non-intersecting Brownian Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-matrix model for non-intersecting Brownian bridges with multiple starts and ends: it is a Gaussian Hermitian ensemble 'dressed' by two Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (HCIZ) integrals encoding the boundary data. We prove that, at finite $n$ (including confluent multiplicities), its eigenvalue law coincides with the Karlin-McGregor distribution. A structural "single-HCIZ collapse" of the partition function, with an explicit $t$-dependent prefactor, identifies it as a $2$D-Toda $\tau$-function in Miwa variables and leads to Virasoro constraints via Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the reduction $(p,q)=(2,1)$, the model matches the external-field ensemble spectrally while exhibiting distinct angular statistics (Haar-distributed eigenvectors). These results provide the matrix-integral origin for the mixed-type multiple orthogonal polynomial/Riemann-Hilbert description and enable direct finite-$n$ identities and large-$n$ asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Rigorous test of the Raleigh-Ritz method for Mexican hat type potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interesting quantum integrable models are rare and one often has to resort to approximation methods. One of these is the Raleigh Ritz method which under certain circumstances allows to approximately compute the lowest energy eigenstate (or ground state) of a given Hamiltonian whose pure point spectrum is bounded from below. The quality of such approximations can then be tested numerically or sometimes by abstract arguments.
  However, the numerical test is limited by computing power. In order to perform a rigorous test, one would need to have at one's disposal 1. a physically interesting model that is 2. solvable to sufficient extent in order that 3. the exact ground state is known in closed form.
  In this contribution we show that certain anharmonic potentials of the Mexican hat type belong to this class of models. The corresponding Schroedinger type Hamiltonian can be considered as a crude quantum mechanical toy model Hamiltonian for the Higgs field in the standard model of elementary particle physics.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: a new window into ultra-light vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), provide a platform to probe new fundamental fields through extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact secondary object carrying scalar or vector charges inspirals into a massive primary. In a theory-agnostic framework, we compute the ultra-light vector and gravitational radiation emitted by eccentric EMRIs and determine the corresponding inspiral trajectories. We evaluate the impact of a massive vector (Proca) field on EMRIs waveform through dephasing and mismatches with predictions by general relativity. Using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we further assess LISA's capability to constrain the Proca mass from future EMRIs observations. We find that orbital eccentricity can improve estimation accuracy of parameters, making the vector mass $\mu$ become detectable for the case of $\mu=0.02$ . Correlation analysis further reveals strong positive dependencies between the Proca mass and intrinsic source parameters, indicating that improved measurement of these parameters directly tightens constraints on vector mass. These results demonstrate that high-eccentricity EMRIs observed by LISA offer a powerful channel to detect or constrain massive vector-field extensions of GR in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry principles of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instantaneous elastic response of gravitational perturbations to the thermal plasma can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early universe. The obstacle is that there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this contact term, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the thermal initial state on a perturbed FLRW background. Diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance allow the (grand) canonical ensemble, defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that break the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis, providing a nontrivial consistency check and a robust basis for quantum-field-theoretic treatments of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geodesics in Bardeen Regular Black Hole: Conventional vs. Modified Geometrothermodynamics Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic geometry allow us to study the microscopic behavior of black hole system by defining a metric structure in thermodynamic phase space. Among the various thermodynamic metric structures, metrics defined by geometrothermodynamics (GTD) are extensively used to study the various thermodynamic system due to its Legendre invariant nature. In this work we investigate the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic of Bardeen regular black hole in thermodynamic space defined by three different GTD metrics. Based on the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic as well as thermodynamic curvature we argued that conventional GTD metric need some modifications to reflect all the thermodynamical properties of a system. We also modified the conventional GTD metrics and explore the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic defined by the modified metrics. Our study shows that the modified GTD metrics contain most of the information about the thermodynamical boundaries such as temperature vanishing line, spinodal line etc. of a black hole system. Based on the property of geodesic and Ricci scalar defined by the modified metrics we argued that the modified version of GTD metric are most suitable metric structures for studying the underlying thermodynamic behavior of a black hole system.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Flavor Fragmentation and Jet Structure from HF-NRevo: Bridging to Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recent progress on the Heavy-Flavor Non-Relativistic Evolution (HF-NRevo) framework, designed to describe leading-power fragmentation of heavy-flavored hadrons at moderate to large transverse momentum. Starting from NLO NRQCD calculations for all partonic channels into pseudoscalar quarkonia, we construct the NRFF1.0 collinear fragmentation functions via DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We outline future prospects in the heavy-ion context, where HF-NRevo can serve as a baseline for modeling in-medium modifications of heavy-flavor fragmentation in nuclear collisions. Its accurate modeling of the partonic hierarchy and threshold effects makes it ideally suited to explore jet-quenching sensitivity, energy-loss mechanisms, and the emergence of medium-modified fragmentation functions in the quark-gluon plasma. Moreover, it provides a natural baseline for implementing in-medium hadronization scenarios, including quarkonium regeneration and fragmentation-function apparent-shape distortion. These developments provide new handles for exploring heavy-flavor dynamics at the HL-LHC and future collider facilities.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory: from the Hamiltonian to applications in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from collapsing domain walls with full general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of isolated closed domain walls with 3+1 numerical relativity. A closed wall shrinks due to its own surface tension, and its surface energy is converted to the kinetic energy, leading to implosion. Then, it can result in the formation of a black hole. First, we focus on spherically symmetric closed domain walls and clarify whether they finally evolve into black holes. Naively, the wall can collapse if its thickness is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius which is determined by the initial surface energy. Our numerical results support this naive criterion for the black hole formation, and indicate that more than 80% of the initial wall energy falls into the black hole. We also investigate the nonspherical collapse by considering the ellipsoidal configurations for the closed domain walls, and it turns out that black holes can be formed even when the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes is 1.5.</description>

      <title>Super Higher-Teichm\"uller Geometry and Loop Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a supersymmetric extension of the Fock-Goncharov cluster ensemble associated with a split basic classical Lie supergroup $G$ and a marked bordered surface $S$. The resulting structure defines a super higher-Teichm\"uller geometry: a split super--thickening of $(\mathscr A_{G,S}, \mathscr X_{G,S})$ equipped with a mutation atlas preserving a canonical super log-symplectic form. Each super seed carries an integer weight matrix $W$ encoding Cartan weights of an abelian odd slice, transforming by the column $g$--vector rule and giving rise to a flat logarithmic superconnection and a canonical super volume form. On this geometric foundation we define a canonical logarithmic superform $\Omega_{\mathrm{super}}^{(L)}$ on a loop fibration $\pi_L : \mathscr X^{(L)}_{G,S} \!\to\! \mathscr X_{G,S}$ as the relative lift of the base super volume. For $G = PGL(4|4)$, the corresponding super period $P_{\mathrm{super}} = \int_{C} \Omega_{\mathrm{super}}^{(L)}$ encodes the loop amplitude data of planar $N = 4$ super Yang--Mills, expressed through a unified and triangulation-independent formula that satisfies Steinmann and cluster adjacency, with the even sector given by Chen iterated integrals and the odd sector captured by an invariant BCFW delta.</description>

      <title>Mass and Decay-Constant Evolution of Heavy Quarkonia and $B_c$ States from Thermal QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal behavior of heavy vector and axial-vector mesons ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$, and $B_c$) within the finite-temperature QCD sum-rule framework. Using updated PDG-2024 quark masses, modern lattice-informed gluon condensates, and a temperature-dependent continuum threshold constrained by vacuum stability, we compute the evolution of the masses $m(T)$ and decay constants $f(T)$ up to $T/T_c \lesssim 0.9$. The extracted zero-temperature limits reproduce experimental and LHCb values within 1\%. Near the critical temperature, the relative suppression follows a clear hierarchy $\Upsilon &lt; J/\psi &lt; B_c$, consistent with their binding energies and lattice spectral trends. The predicted $1P$--$1S$ splitting for the $B_c$ system, $0.477~\mathrm{GeV}$, matches the LHCb observation of orbitally excited $B_c^{+}$ states. The results provide a coherent finite-temperature baseline for future extensions including radiative, higher-dimensional, and width effects.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebra $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$ and Elliptic Stable Envelopes for the $A^{(1)}_{N-1}$ Quiver Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new construction of vertex operators of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$ by combining representations of the algebra and formulas of the elliptic stable envelopes for the $A^{(1)}_{N-1}$ quiver variety ${\cal M}(v,w)$. Compositions of the vertex operators turn out consistent to the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes. Their highest to highest expectation values provide K-theoretic vertex functions for ${\cal M}(v,w)$. We also derive exchange relation of the vertex operators and construct a $L$-operator satisfying the $RLL=LLR^*$ relation with $R$ and $R^*$ being elliptic dynamical $R$-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of $L$ and defining a comultiplication $\Delta$ in terms of it, we show that our vertex operators are intertwining operators of the $U_{t_1,t_2,p}(\mathfrak{gl}_{N,tor})$-modules w.r.t $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Spontaneous CP Violation in Supersymmetric Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong CP problem remains one of the most important unresolved issues in the Standard Model. Spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) is a promising approach to the problem by assuming that CP is an exact symmetry of the Lagrangian but broken spontaneously at the vacuum, which enables the generation of the observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase without reintroducing a nonzero strong CP phase. Supersymmetry (SUSY) provides a natural framework to accommodate such a mechanism, as SUSY can not only protect the scale of SCPV from radiative corrections but also suppress problematic higher-dimensional operators generating a strong CP phase. In the present study, we explore the realization of SCPV in two distinct SUSY scenarios. First, we investigate SCPV in the exact SUSY limit, extending the spurion formalism developed in non-supersymmetric theories and introducing a method to determine whether the given superpotential satisfies the necessary condition for SCPV. Second, we construct a model in which CP is spontaneously broken at an intermediate scale along pseudo-flat directions, stabilized by soft SUSY breaking and non-perturbative effects of a gauge theory. The latter setup predicts light scalars in the SCPV sector whose masses are determined by the SUSY breaking scale.</description>

      <title>The universal topological charge of black hole photon spheres in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently developed topological approach offers novel insights into photon spheres, which are fundamental to the formation of black hole shadows. In this study, we extend this topological analysis to higher-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black holes. By examining the asymptotic properties of the vector field associated with the photon spheres, we demonstrate that their topological charge is consistently -1. This result is a dimensionally independent invariant, guaranteeing the existence of at least one standard (unstable) photon sphere outside the event horizon. We further explore this conclusion by analyzing two distinct regular black hole solutions derived from pure gravity theory, confirming that the topological charge remains -1 irrespective of the spacetime dimension. These results provide a robust and universal characterization of photon spheres in higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum cosmology of supersymmetric, homogeneous and isotropic, higher derivative models. We recall superfield actions obtained in previous works and give classically equivalent actions leading to second order equations for the bosons, and first order for the fermions. Upon quantization, the algebra of fermions leads to a multi-component state, which is annihilated by the Hamiltonian and supersymmetric constraint operators. We obtain asymptotic wave functions of the oscillatory type, whose classical limit corresponds to inflationary evolution, and exact exponential wave functions. We use the latter to derive probability distributions of the initial curvature that are compatible with those obtained using the non-supersymmetric model.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions of regular black holes in anti-de Sitter space with Lyapunov exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between thermodynamic phase transitions and the Lyapunov exponent of charged regular anti-de Sitter black holes in quasi-topological gravity. Our results show that the Lyapunov exponent displays oscillatory behavior during phase transitions. Moreover, along the coexistence curve the Lyapunov exponent changes discontinously and continuously at the critical point. Near the critical point, the Lyapunov exponent follows a power-law behavior with a critical exponent of 1/2, suggesting its role as an order parameter and encodes information on black hole phase transitions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a six-dimensional U(1)$_\chi$ gauge theory compactified on a magnetized torus, where the zero mode of the extra-dimensional gauge field (a Wilson-line (WL) scalar field) plays the role of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) candidate. The pNG DM is naturally included by construction without introducing an additional scalar field. We show that the leading spin-independent DM-nucleus amplitude is suppressed by momentum transfer in our model as expected from the pNG DM model. This suppression allows the model to evade the current severe direct-detection bounds while achieving the observed thermal relic abundance in well-defined regions of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Border bases are a generalization of Gr\"obner bases for polynomial rings. In this article, we introduce border bases for a non-commutative ring of linear differential operators, namely the rational Weyl algebra. We elaborate on their properties and present algorithms to compute with them. We apply this theory to represent integrable connections as cyclic $D$-modules explicitly. As an application, we visit differential equations behind a stringy, a Feynman as well as a cosmological integral. We also address the classification of particular $D$-ideals of a fixed holonomic rank, namely the case of linear PDEs with constant coefficients as well as Frobenius ideals. Our approach rests on the theory of Hilbert schemes of points in affine space.</description>

      <title>The Compressed 3D Lyman-Alpha Forest Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k &lt;= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.</description>

Abstract: We propose a generalisation of the Moore-Tachikawa varieties for the case in which the target category of the 2D TFT is a hyperk$\ddot{\text{a}}$hler quotient. The setup requires generalising the bordism operators of Moore and Segal to the case involving lack of reparametrisation-invariance on the Riemann surface, ultimately enabling to relate this to the issue of defining a Drinfeld center for composite class ${\cal S}$ theories.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We exploit the flag and Orlik-Solomon algebra to reconstruct the intersection number of twisted cocycles and obtain the bi-adjoint amplitude. By studying the pairing of the special flag, we find that it results to Cachao-He-Yuan representation of the bi-adjoint amplitude. Through identifying each standard flag with Feynman trivalent diagram, in which the propagatoris bilinear form of the flag $S^{(a)(F_m,F_m)}$, we also find the geometry interpretation of Bern-Carrasco-Johansson duality discovered by Mizera as the identity of flag with a gap. According to the definition of flag simplex, we also construct the Z-amplitude in the $\alpha^{\prime} \rightarrow 0 $ limit.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPTs before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries can be obtained from invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible \textit{$G$-ality defects}. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using the SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification was previously determined by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Bananas with EOW Branes and Spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study and generalize the spacetime banana proposal for computing correlation functions of huge operators in the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. First, we introduce time-like and space-like EOW branes into the proposal and demonstrate that: 1) a holographic dual of the one-point function in a BCFT can be obtained and its modified on-shell action reproduces the expected BCFT result; and 2) the GHY term on the stretched horizon can be replaced by the action of an EOW brane which wraps the horizon. Next, we discuss the two (one)-point function of huge spinning operators described by a rotating black hole in the bulk. We show that simply adding a GHY term on the stretched horizon is insufficient to reproduce the CFT results; instead, the appropriate modified action should be the micro-canonical action. Finally, we revisit the existing approaches for computing correlation functions using the gravity on-shell action of conical geometry or Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries. Surprisingly, we find that the on-shells actions of the Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries or the gravity solutions in the FG gauge yield unexpected incorrect results.</description>

Abstract: We give examples of cohomologies of the superconformal algebra, relevant to computations in the AdS supergravity. Our main examples are deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$ transforming in finite-dimensional representations of the superconformal algebra at the linearized level. In the study of correlation functions, it is important to compute the resolution of BRST-exact products of vertex operators. The resolution is typically non-covariant, because of cohomological obstacles. Using the pure spinor formalism, we develop a framework to describe these obstacles, and formulate conjectures about their structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. The small diffeomorphism (gauge) symmetries generated by the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are completely fixed by the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic/Dirac gauge conditions after which the residual phase space degrees of freedom are gauge invariant. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTZ solution. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, asymptote to the usual Schwarzschild slices, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. We also derive unique large diffeomorphisms that asymptote to time translations on both boundaries in the maximal slicing gauge.
  We present the solution of the scalar field wave equation in this gauge in terms of its boundary values which correspond to boundary CFT operators by the AdS/CFT dictionary. We explicitly construct the finite, time-dependent Hamiltonian in terms of a discrete set of mode functions of the scalar field that are smooth and differentiable across the horizons of the fully extended BTZ black hole. These modes mix the boundary operators from the two sides and are appropriate linear combinations of the Hartle-Hawking-Unruh modes. This Hamiltonian is an operator in the product of the two CFTs associated to the two boundaries and describes the time evolution of CFT operators. Our results are valid for evolution times smaller than the scrambling time during which the fully extended BTZ solution continues to be a valid saddle point of the quantum gravity path integral.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Proton Structure Functions from Holographic Einstein-Dilaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the proton structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the context of holography. We develop a general framework that extends previous holographic calculations of $F_1$ and $F_2$ to the case where the bulk geometry stems from bottom-up Einstein-Dilaton models, which are commonly used in the literature to describe some properties of QCD in the strong coupling regime. We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. Once the parameters of the background holographic model are fixed, we introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk {\it a la} Polchinski and Strassler to determine the corresponding structure functions. This particular realization of the model can successfully describe the proton mass and provide results for $F_2$ at large $x$ in very good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in holographic junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a cosmological scenario where an effective violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) is realized through a coupling between SEC-fulfilling dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). Although the SEC-violating solutions might in principle last for an arbitrarily long time, we highlight several challenges that string realizations must face: most notably, these are the identification of suitable heavy states and their relationship with the theory cutoff. Furthermore, we discuss a black-hole argument that still allows for long-lived epochs of cosmic acceleration, but that prevents them from lasting forever. We also discuss negative potentials in the presence of a tower of light states, showing that the DM/DE coupling can push the theory towards regions of parametric control.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a general fusion procedure for open $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ spin chains. We construct the fused boundary reflection matrices and the corresponding fused reflection equations. By using the intertwining relation between the fused reflection matrices and the fusion operator, we identify the invariant subspace of the fused reflection matrices carrying the irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$. We also construct the fused transfer matrix and evaluate it explicitly in the total tensor product space and the invariant subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that the ABJM spin chain model originates from such fusion procedure and derive three classes of boundary reflection matrices solutions on the anti-fundamental representation space of $\mathfrak{su}(4)$.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic description for general stress-energy tensor deformations in arbitrary dimensions using the metric flow approach. Mixed boundary conditions corresponding to these deformations emerge from solutions to the metric flow equations. To test this proposal, we analyze planar anti-de Sitter black holes with such boundary conditions and find that the deformed energies satisfy flow equations consistent with the field theory interpretation. We further derive the commuting condition for stress-energy tensor deformations and extend the mixed boundary condition description to accommodate families of commuting deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We point out that fermionic unitary operators which anticommute among themselves appear in various situations in quantum field theories with anomalies in the Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate, we give multiple derivations of the fact that position-dependent $U(1)$ transformations of two-dimensional theories with $U(1)$ symmetry of odd level are fermionic when the winding number is odd. We then relate this mechanism to the anomalies of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetry, whose description also crucially uses unitary operators which are fermionic. We also show that position-dependent $SU(2)$ transformations of four-dimensional theories with $SU(2)$ symmetry with Witten anomaly are fermionic and anticommute among themselves when the winding number is odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the generalizations of Kaluza--Klein compactifications of 5D Horndeski theory. They are Scalar--Vector--Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar--Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. A subclass of these SVT theories is such that the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. We show a subclass where the vector sector retains freedom through new functions of $\pi,\, X$ while the speed of the vector modes still tracks the speed of the tensor modes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Mixed States for Baby Universes and Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.</description>

      <title>Baryons, Skyrmions and $\theta$-periodicity anomaly in chiral and vector-like gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the baryons and solitons of chiral and vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories with matter in mixed one and two-index representations. Focusing on the Color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, we compute the topology of the coset of their low-energy EFT. We find that in the chiral models under consideration, Skyrmions are always absent. We also show, however, that some of these models admit heavy baryons that are expected to be stable, because their decay into the lighter degrees of freedom of the EFT is forbidden by the unbroken symmetry group. This mismatch suggests that some deeper dynamical mechanism must be responsible with either the instability of the seemingly stable heavy baryons or the unreliability of the Skyrme model in the low-energy EFT. In the vector-like models all the expected baryons are mirrored by Skyrmions. Then we turn to the study of domain walls. We determine some aspects of their dynamics by matching the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly. We find that, for complete CFL, the $\theta$-periodicity anomaly is always matched without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom in the low-energy EFT. If part of the color group is unbroken, new dynamical degrees of freedom must be added to the low-energy EFT in the domain-wall background with few exceptions.</description>

      <title>Tests of restricted Quantum Focusing and a new CFT bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT. We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d&gt;2$, we derive from the rQFC a constraint stronger than the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC). In a broad class of states, this bound forbids the QNEC from saturating faster than $O(\mathcal{A})$ as the transverse area $\mathcal{A}$ of a certain null deformation shrinks to zero. We speculate about a universal strengthened QNEC holding across all QFT states.</description>

      <title>Strings near BTZ black holes: A Carrollian Chronicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BTZ black hole provides a tractable (2+1)-dimensional example for investigating string dynamics in curved spacetime. However, a systematic and robust analysis of the solution space of strings in the near-horizon region of BTZ black holes remains elusive in the literature. This work aims to fill this gap by employing the string-Carroll expansion. This formalism provides a natural setting for working with the near-horizon region, because near-horizon expansions for non-extremal black holes match string-Carroll expansions. Using this formalism, and expanding the string action and pullback fields in powers of an effective speed of light, we study the dynamics of closed bosonic strings in the near-horizon, non-extremal BTZ spacetime. Our approach classifies the general characteristics and further reveals some novel features of the families of string solutions.</description>

      <title>Covariant diagonalization of the perfect fluid stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2779</link>
      <description>arXiv:1211.2779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new tetrads that manifestly and covariantly diagonalize the stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid with vorticity at every spacetime point. This new tetrad can be applied and introduce simplification in the analysis of astrophysical relativistic problems where vorticity is present through the Carter-Lichnerowicz equation. This new tetrad also enables the construction in a simple fashion of Euler and Coordinate observers relevant to the Cauchy evolution of many hydrodynamical relativistic problems in the case with no vorticity and the presence of a symmetry where the tetrads are completely analogous to the case with vorticity. We also discuss the origin of inertia in this special case from the standpoint of our new local tetrads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $A\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric hybrid inflation and current-carrying metastable cosmic strings in $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a realistic supersymmetric model for superheavy metastable cosmic strings (CSs) that can be investigated in the current pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. It is based on shifted $\mu$-hybrid inflation in which the symmetry breaking $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R\rightarrow SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_R$ proceeds along an inflationary trajectory such that the topologically unstable primordial monopoles are inflated away. {{The breaking of $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_R \rightarrow U(1)_Y$ after inflation ends yields the superheavy metastable CSs carrying the right handed neutrino zero modes that generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which we show is consistent with the current PTA data set and the LIGO O3 run}}. The scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are compatible with the Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope measurements. Both reheating and leptogenesis are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering of electromagnetic fields from ringing black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) paves the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Black holes (BHs) in their ringdown phase provide the cleanest signal of emitted GWs that imprint the fundamental nature of BHs under low energy perturbation. Apart from GWs, any complementary signature of ringing BHs can be of paramount importance. Motivated by this we analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a background and demonstrated that the absorption cross section of a ringing Schwarzschild BH can be superradiant. Moreover, we have found out that such superradiant phenomena are transient in nature with a characteristic time scale equal to the GW oscillation time scale. We further point out that the existing ground-based Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), radio telescopes, may be able to detect such transient signals from BHs of mass range $M\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, which should necessarily be of primordial origin. Our present result opens up an intriguing possibility of observing the black hole merging phenomena through electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance breaking has been investigated in the literature in several contexts, including emergent General Relativity (GR). If GR emerges from an underlying theory without diffeomorphism invariance, there may be small violations of this symmetry at low energies. Since such small violations should not cause instabilities in cosmological evolution, it is a suitable framework for examining such symmetry-breaking effects. In this paper, the cosmological evolution with broken diffeomorphism invariance is investigated in the (modified) FLRW spacetime in the effective theory framework. The GR Lagrangian is augmented with all diffeomorphism-breaking but Lorentz-invariant terms in the leading order, namely, those involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the conditions arising in the linearized theory. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since an analytic solution does not exist in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no signs of singular behavior are observed: minor diffeomorphism-violating modifications to GR at the level of two derivatives do not cause instabilities in the basic cosmological evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the shift (translation) and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that shifts composed of an odd multiple of the elementary shift anti-commute with time reversal and are related to continuum axial transformations. We argue that the presence of these non-trivial commutation relations implies the existence of lattice 't Hooft anomalies. From the shifts we also construct a set of conserved, quantized charges that generate continuous symmetries of the lattice theory. In general these do not commute with the vector charge signaling further 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

      <title>Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between pair-created twin universes with opposite time arrows should leave a birthmark on CMB spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why (and how) the Universe was born is one of the ultimate questions in physics. Another big puzzle is about the arrow of time: why is there only one direction of time? Are these two issues related? One way to solve both puzzles at one stroke is to posit that our universe was pair-created with a twin, whose time arrow is opposite to ours. If so, then the twins must naturally be quantum entangled. In Euclidean quantum gravity, this implies the existence of a Euclidean wormhole bridging the twin universes. Each universe is then in a mixed-state and the mutual entanglement shall leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum. Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks wormhole as a toy model for the sake of tractability, we show that the entanglement selects a novel and unique global vacuum for the total inflaton perturbations in both universes. This is equivalent to imposing a simple harmonic oscillator boundary condition on the Euclidean wavefunction of the total perturbations, and it turns out that the entanglement enhances the CMB power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. Such a birthmark renders our notion refutable.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Tidal Dissipation Numbers of Non-rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of tidal dissipation numbers (TDNs) quantifies the absorption of the tidal force exerted by a companion during an inspiralling phase of a binary compact object. This tidal dissipation generally affects the gravitational waveform, and measuring the TDNs of a black hole (BH) allows us to test the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method, which connects the underlying perturbative equations with observable quantities in gravitational-wave observations in a theory-agnostic manner. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential. As an application of our formalism, we consider three examples: the effective field theory of BH perturbations with timelike scalar profile, the Einstein-Maxwell system, and a higher-curvature extension of general relativity. We also discuss the absence of logarithmic running for the TDNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ system coupled to scalar fields. Initially the model is studied in a novel continuum formulation and study of the appropriate diagonalizations is performed. Three models are examined, in two of which the scalar field couples with both gauge fields while in the third one the scalar field couples only to the dark photon. The model is then treated on a space-time lattice. We determine the phase diagram for various values of the kinetic coupling parameter. Then there follows the determination of masses for the scalar fields and the massive gauge fields, as well as the fine structure constants for the massless gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate simulations of asymmetric black-hole scattering and cross validation of effective-one-body models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key result is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions V: complex $\phi^4$ field model in $3+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2024zal} and associated studies, a relativistic finite-volume formalism in $1+1$ dimensions is proposed to extract infinite-volume scattering phaseshift.
  It is based on the difference of integrated correlation functions (ICF) rather than energy spectrum in the finite volume, and can be regarded as complementary to the well-known L\"{uscher} formalism.
  In the present work, the formalism is further extended into $3+1$ dimensional spacetime. The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.</description>

      <title>Eikonal quasinormal modes of highly-spinning black holes in higher-curvature gravity: a window into extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Singularities in Feynman Integrals via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case, it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for exploring scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Field Theoretic Approach to Interacting Two Body Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two body tunneling problems are hard to treat analytically due to the incompatibility between tunneling and perturbation theory. The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude by perturbing on interparticle interaction and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement production in the decay of a metastable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments produced at different times and compute the corresponding entanglement entropy increments. On the basis of these results, we argue that such entropy increments are useful entanglement measures, especially in cases, such as Hawking radiation, where one wishes to separate the radiation into ``old'' and ``new.''</description>
