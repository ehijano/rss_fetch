      <title>Beacon2Science: Enhancing STEREO/HI beacon data1 with machine learning for efficient CME tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing and forecasting coronal mass ejections (CME) in real-time is crucial due to the strong geomagnetic storms they can generate that can have a potentially damaging effect, for example, on satellites and electrical devices. With its near-real-time availability, STEREO/HI beacon data is the perfect candidate for early forecasting of CMEs. However, previous work concluded that CME arrival prediction based on beacon data could not achieve the same accuracy as with high-resolution science data due to data gaps and lower quality. We present our novel pipeline entitled ''Beacon2Science'', bridging the gap between beacon and science data to improve CME tracking. Through this pipeline, we first enhance the quality (signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution) of beacon data. We then increase the time resolution of enhanced beacon images through learned interpolation to match science data's 40-minute resolution. We maximize information coherence between consecutive frames with adapted model architecture and loss functions through the different steps. The improved beacon images are comparable to science data, showing better CME visibility than the original beacon data. Furthermore, we compare CMEs tracked in beacon, enhanced beacon, and science images. The tracks extracted from enhanced beacon data are closer to those from science images, with a mean average error of $\sim 0.5 ^\circ$ of elongation compared to $1^\circ$ with original beacon data. The work presented in this paper paves the way for its application to forthcoming missions such as Vigil and PUNCH.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Particle Heating in Shocks and Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles are heated efficiently through energy conversion processes such as shocks and magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma environments. While empirical scaling laws for the temperature increase have been obtained, the precise mechanism of energy partition between ions and electrons remains unclear. Here we show, based on coupled theoretical and observational scaling analyses, that the temperature increase, $\Delta T$, depends linearly on three factors: the available magnetic energy per particle, the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number (or reconnection rate), and the characteristic spatial scale $L$. Based on statistical datasets obtained from Earth's plasma environment, we find that $L$ is on the order of (1) the ion gyro-radius for ion heating at shocks, (2) the ion inertial length for ion heating in magnetic reconnection, and (3) the hybrid inertial length for electron heating in both shocks and magnetic reconnection. With these scales, we derive the ion-to-electron ratios of temperature increase as $\Delta T_{\rm i}/\Delta T_{\rm e} = (3\beta_{\rm i}/2)^{1/2}(m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e})^{1/4}$ for shocks and $\Delta T_{\rm i}/\Delta T_{\rm e} = (m_{\rm i}/m_{\rm e})^{1/4}$ for magnetic reconnection, where $\beta_{\rm i}$ is the ion plasma beta, and $m_{\rm i}$ and $ m_{\rm e}$ are the ion and electron particle masses, respectively. We anticipate that this study will serve as a starting point for a better understanding of particle heating in space plasmas, enabling more sophisticated modeling of its scaling and universality.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that two prominent theories of ion heating in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas -- stochastic and quasi-linear heating -- represent similar physical processes in turbulence with different normalized cross helicities. To capture both, we propose a simple phenomenology based on the power in scales at which critically balanced fluctuations reach their smallest parallel scale. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as relevant to the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>
