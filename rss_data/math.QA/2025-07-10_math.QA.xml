      <title>On some integral properties of dimensions in Isaacs fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fusion category, we prove some new integral properties concerning the dimension of a simple object that generates a Isaacs fusion subcategory. A stronger divisibility result is proven for any modular fusion category. This divisibility result implies the converse direction of a Ito-Michler type result for modular fusion categories, recently established by the author.</description>

      <title>The Geometric P=W conjecture and Thurston's compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for a well-known embedding of the set of isotopy classes of multicurves on a closed surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{N}^{9g - 9}$. More significantly, we relate this result and established facts about Thurston's compactification of Teichm\"uller space to the geometric P = W conjecture for $\tn{SL}(2,\C)$, which concerns projective compactifications of character varieties of closed surfaces. In particular, we construct a projective compactification of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety for any closed surface of genus $g &gt; 1$, in which the boundary divisors are toric orbifolds and their dual intersection complex is a sphere.</description>

      <title>Maximal amenability of the radial subalgebra in free quantum group factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the radial MASA in the orthogonal free quantum group algebra L(FO_N) is maximal amenable if N is large enough, using the Asymptotic Orthogonality Property. This relies on a detailed study of the corresponding bimodule, for which we construct in particular a quantum analogue of R\u{a}dulescu's basis. As a byproduct we also obtain the value of the Puk\'anszky invariant for this MASA.</description>

      <title>Hodge structures on conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of complex Hodge structures on modular functors. The proof is based on the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence and Ocneanu rigidity. Given a modular functor, we explain how its Hodge numbers fit into a Frobenius algebra and the Chern characters of its Hodge decompositions into a new cohomological field theory (CohFT). In the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ modular functors of level $2$ times an odd number, we give explicit formulas for all Hodge numbers, in any genus $g$.</description>

      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu. I. Manin, M. Sweedler and D. Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J. Patera and H. Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal{C}$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal{C}$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Five-Term Relations for wreath Macdonald polynomials and tableau formulas for Pieri coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a variety of new identities involving operators in the theory of wreath Macdonald polynomials. One such family of identities gives five-term relations, analogous to the one given by Garsia and Mellit for the modified Macdonald polynomials. As a consequence, we generate tableau formulas for wreath Macdonald Pieri coefficients, which give an incredibly quick way of computing their monomial expansions.</description>

      <title>An identity for generating series of deformations of multiple zeta values within an algebraic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bachmann proves an identity expressing the generating series of MacMahon's generalized sum-of-divisors $q$-series in terms of Eisenstein series. MacMahon's $q$-series can be regarded as a $q$-analogue of the multiple zeta value $\zeta(2, 2, \ldots , 2)$, up to a power of $1-q$. Based on this observation, we generalize Bachmann's identity within an algebraic framework and prove a general identity. As a byproduct, we obtain a formula for the generating series of another deformation of multiple zeta values defined by the author. In this formula, periodlike functions introduced by Lewis and Zagier appear as a counterpart of Eisenstein series.</description>
