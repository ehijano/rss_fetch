      <title>Limitations of emittance and source size measurement of laser-accelerated electron beams using the pepper-pot mask method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pepper-pot method is a widely used technique originally proposed for measuring the emittance of space-charge-dominated electron beams from radio-frequency photoinjectors. With recent advances in producing high-brightness electron beams via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), the method has also been applied to evaluate emittance in this new regime [1-3]. In this work, we explore the limitations of the method in inferring the emittance and beam waist of LWFA electron beams, showing that the technique becomes inaccurate for small emittance values.</description>

      <title>BAGELS for simultaneous polarization, orbit, and optics control in electron storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for minimizing the effects of radiative depolarization in electron storage rings by use of a minimal number of special vertical orbit bumps. The bumps can be used to minimize the effects of radiative depolarization while simultaneously maintaining other common benefits of vertical orbits, e.g. transverse coupling and vertical dispersion control. Because simultaneously optimizing the large number of vertical correctors in a ring is operationally infeasible, we use dimensionality reduction to define a minimal number of most effective groups of vertical correctors that can be optimized during operation, motivating the name ``Best Adjustment Groups for ELectron Spin'' (BAGELS). The method is streamlined by using suitable ``basis bumps'' instead of all individual vertical correctors. We define three types of basis bumps for different purposes: (1) generates no delocalized transverse coupling nor delocalized vertical dispersion, (2) generates no delocalized vertical dispersion, and (3) generates no delocalized transverse coupling. BAGELS has been essential in the design of the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and will be beneficial for any polarized electron ring, including FCC-ee. HERA and LEP would have likely benefitted as well. We use BAGELS to significantly increase polarization in the 18 GeV EIC-ESR, beyond achievable with conventional methods; in the 1-IP lattice, we nearly double the asymptotic polarization, and in the 2-IP lattice we more than triple the asymptotic polarization. We also use BAGELS to construct knobs that can be used for global coupling correction, and knobs that generate vertical emittance for beam size matching, all while having minimal impacts on the polarization and orbit/optics.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of modulated positron bunch formed in crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar channeling of the positrons of a bunch taking into account medium polarization is considered, which entails it's radiation at both soft and hard photons at a zero angle. Spatially uniphase charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. This phenomenon can only occur in microundulators with account of the polarization. The crystalline undulator (CU) parameters (the spatial period and the amplitude) are chosen to preserve the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CU radiation (CUR) from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation hinges on the modulation depth of a microbunch. The latter, an important parameter of a bunch, will also be possible to determine as a result of the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific scenario involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE FEL process at the wavelength corresponding to the SASE FEL.</description>

      <title>Study of the energy spectrum of alpha particles in an experiment on irradiation of a boron target with a proton beam at the Prometheus accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of alpha particles from the nuclear reaction p + $^{11}$B $\rightarrow 3\alpha$ was studied using the beam of the injector of the proton synchrotron of the Prometheus proton therapy complex. The reaction products (alpha particles) were recorded using a CR-39 track detector. The detectors were calibrated using a $^{241}$Am radioactive source. It was determined that mainly alpha particles emitted from the boron target have energies from 3 to 5.5 MeV. In this case, a significant part of the alpha particles emitted from the depths of the target have significantly lower energies compared to the calculated ones due to ionization losses. Measuring the energy spectrum of alpha particles from targets containing boron is of great scientific and practical interest for identifying the mechanisms of boron-proton capture therapy and determining the additional contribution to the therapeutic effect of proton irradiation.</description>

      <title>High gradient twin $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ linear colliders with energy recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a high energy superconducting (SC) \epem linear collider (LC) with energy recovery (ERLC) has been proposed where twin RF structures are used to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider could operate in a DC (duty cycle) or CW (continuous) modes, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=250-500$ GeV. In this paper, it is noted that the luminosity in the ERLC is independent of the accelerating gradient (at the same total power). Therefore, the ERLC could operate at maximum available accelerating gradients. This paper considers for the first time an $e^-e^-$ twin collider with ER and estimates its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is much simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one because beam recirculation is not needed. Travelling wave RF structures allow for higher gradients and reduced heat load. It is shown that an ERLC with accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m could operate in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1 -- 2.5)$\times 10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3 -- 7)$\times 10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable powers of 150 and 300 MW for $2E_0=250$ and $2E_0=500$ GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>Powerful source of bremsstrahlung x-ray radiation based on a high current pulsed electron accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancement of the bremsstrahlung X-ray radiation (BSXR) power generated by the high-current relativistic electron beam (REB) of a pulsed direct-action accelerator TEMP-B is being curried out to use in particular for studying the radiation resistance of walls material of radioactive waste containers. For this the magnetic field in which REB is transported in the drift chamber is taken higher at some distance before the converter to provide REB diameter on the converter the same as in the drift chamber. Scheme of power supply and creation of the required magnetic field for the REB current transportation through the whole distance from the diode to the converter is developed. Higher BSXR dose per REB current pulse at the same energy resource is obtained.</description>
