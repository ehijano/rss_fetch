      <description>arXiv:2511.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $T$ has dependent dividing, then the burden agrees with the dp-rank witnessed by NIP formulas. We use this observation to prove that if $T$ has dependent dividing, then the burden is sub-additive. We also state a connection between the burden and the dual VC density.</description>

      <title>Generalized Explosion Principles: A Semantic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is motivated by the fact that there is a distinction between the descriptions of logical explosion from syntactic and semantic points of view. The discussion is illustrated using the concept of abstract model structures and the notions of satisfiability and finite satisfiability in these structures. Various principles of explosion have been described in terms of unsatisfiability or finite unsatisfiability. The semantic analogues of the principles of explosion introduced in [3] have also been considered among these. The article also studies the characterizations of and the interconnections between these new principles of explosion.</description>

      <title>A logic of co-valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A co-valuation is, essentially, a minimal finite cover. We introduce a logic based on co-valuations, which play the role of valuations of free variables in classical first-order logic, and show that the fundamental tools of model theory - such as ultraproducts, compactness, and omitting types - can be developed in this framework. Using a recently discovered duality between certain countable posets and second-countable compact $T_1$ spaces, we prove that these spaces play the role analogous to countable universes in first-order logic. Thus, although no topology appears in the initial formulation, the logic of co-valuations turns out to be naturally suited for studying compact topological objects. Standard topological notions, such as connectedness and covering dimension, are easily expressible, and model-theoretic properties, including atomicity, can be effectively analyzed. The framework also interacts well with Fra\"iss\'e-type constructions.</description>

      <title>Tukey-idempotency and strong p-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize strong $p$-point ultrafilters by showing that they are exactly those $p$-points that are not Tukey above $(\omega^\omega,\leq)$; or equivalently, those $p$-points that are not Tukey-idempotent. Moreover, we show that there are no Canjar ultrafilters on measurable cardinals. We make use of tools which were motivated by topological Ramsey spaces, developed in \cite{Benhamou/Dobrinen24}, and furthermore, show that ultrafilters arising from most of the known topological Ramsey spaces are Tukey-idempotent. Our results answer questions of Hru\v{s}\'ak and Verner \cite[Question 5.7]{Hrusak/Verner11}, Brook-Taylor \cite[Question 3.6]{{QuestionGeneralized}}, and partially Benhamou and Dobrinen \cite[Question 5.6]{Benhamou/Dobrinen24}.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homeomorphisms and the homeomorphism groups of compact metric spaces using the automorphism groups of projective Fra\"iss\'e limits. In our applications, we investigate the Polish group ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ of all homeomorphisms of the pseudoarc $P$ using the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$ of the pre-pseudoarc $\mathbb{P}$. Strengthening results from the literature, we show that the diagonal conjugacy action of ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ on ${\rm Homeo}(P)^{\mathbb{N}}$ has a dense orbit. In our second application, we show that there exists a homeomorphism of $P$ that is not conjugate in ${\rm Homeo}(P)$ to an element of ${\rm Aut}(\mathbb{P})$.</description>

      <title>Uniform interpolation for interpretability logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof-theoretical study of the interpretability logic IL, providing a wellfounded and a non-wellfounded sequent calculus for IL. The non-wellfounded calculus is used to establish a cut elimination argument for both calculi. In addition, we show that the non-wellfounded proof theory of IL is well-behaved, i.e., that cyclic proofs suffice. This makes it possible to prove uniform interpolation for IL. As a corollary we also provide a proof of uniform interpolation for the interpretability logic ILP.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Logic of Trust-Based Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, an agent's beliefs would come from what the agent can see, hear, or sense. In the modern world, beliefs are often based on the data available to the agents. In this work, we investigate a dynamic logic of such beliefs that incorporates public announcements of data. The main technical contribution is a sound and complete axiomatisation of the interplay between data-informed beliefs and data announcement modalities. We also describe a non-trivial polynomial model checking algorithm for this logical system.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the analytic log-canonical threshold over local fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a local field $F$ of positive characteristic, an $F$-analytic manifold $X$ and an analytic function $f:X\rightarrow F$, the $F$-analytic log-canonical threshold $\mathrm{lct}_{F}(f;x_{0})$ is the supremum over the values $s\geq0$ such that $\left|f\right|_{F}^{-s}$ is integrable near $x_{0}\in X$. We show that $\mathrm{lct}_{F}(f;x_{0})&gt;0$. Moreover, if $f$ is a regular function on a smooth algebraic $F$-variety, we obtain an effective lower bound $\mathrm{lct}_{F}(f;x_{0})&gt;C$, where $C&gt;0$ is explicit and depends only on the complexity class of $X$ and $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Priestley duality has diverse applications in various branches of mathematics. In this survey, we discuss its usefulness in pointfree topology. This is done by providing Priestley perspective on several key notions, including spatiality, sublocales, separation axioms, compactness, and local compactness. This approach yields a new perspective on a number of classic results in pointfree topology.</description>

Abstract: For a given stationary set $S$ of countable ordinals we prove (in $\mathbf{ZFC}$) that the assertion "every $S$-ladder system has $\aleph_0$-uniformization" is equivalent to "every strongly $\aleph_1$-free abelian group of cardinality $\aleph_1$ with non-freeness invariant $\subseteq S$ is $\aleph_1$-coseparable, i.e. Ext$(G, \oplus_{i=0}^{\infty} \mathbb Z)=0$ (in particular Whitehead, i.e.\ Ext$(G, \mathbb Z)=0$)". This solves problems B3 and B4 from Eklof and Mekler's monograph.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to the non-wellfounded character of proofs. We will employ the method to obtain syntactic cut elimination for $K^+$, a system of modal logic with the master modality.</description>

      <title>Dimension theory for the asymptotic couple of the field of logarithmic transseries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we completely characterize all dimension functions on all models of the theory $T_{\log}$ of the asymptotic couple of the field of logarithmic transseries (Dimension Theorem). This is done by characterizing the "small" $1$-variable definable sets (Small Sets Theorem). As a byproduct, we show that $T_{\log}$ is d-minimal and does not eliminate imaginaries. Separately, we provide an abstract criterion for d-minimality, which we use to observe some new examples of d-minimal expansions of valued fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Descriptive Set Theory in Generalized Baire Spaces without assuming $\kappa^{&lt;\kappa}=\kappa$. We point out that without this assumption the basic topological concepts of these spaces have to be slightly modified in order to obtain a meaningful theory. This modification has no effect if $\kappa^{&lt;\kappa}=\kappa$. After developing the basic theory we apply it to the question whether the orbits of models of a fixed cardinality $\kappa$ in the space $\kappa^\kappa$ are $\kappa$-Borel in our generalized sense. It turns out that this question depends, as is the case when $\kappa^{&lt;\kappa}=\kappa$, on stability theoretic properties (structure vs. non-structure) of the first order theory of the model.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of ladder system colorings and stationary precaliber forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between variants of the uniformization property for ladder system colorings and fragments of Martin's Axiom. The well-known forcing properties of having precaliber $\aleph_1$ and being $\sigma$-centered correspond to uncountable refinement and countable decomposition into centered subsets, respectively, and the associated forcing axioms have been widely studied. In this paper, we focus on a forcing axiom for the property corresponding to stationary refinement, namely the stationary precaliber $\aleph_1$ property. Analogously, we observe that ladder system coloring uniformization also admits both stationary refinement and countable decomposition variants. We discuss the interaction between these uniformization properties and various forcing axioms. Through this analysis, we obtain as a main result the separation between the forcing axioms for stationary precaliber $\aleph_1$ and for $\sigma$-linked posets.</description>

      <title>Monoid Theory in Alonzo: A Little Theories Formalization in Simple Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alonzo is a practice-oriented classical higher-order version of predicate logic that extends first-order logic and that admits undefined expressions. Named in honor of Alonzo Church, Alonzo is based on Church's type theory, Church's formulation of simple type theory. The little theories method is a method for formalizing mathematical knowledge as a theory graph consisting of theories as nodes and theory morphisms as directed edges. The development of a mathematical topic is done in the "little theory" in the theory graph that has the most convenient level of abstraction and the most convenient vocabulary, and then the definitions and theorems produced in the development are transported, as needed, to other theories via the theory morphisms in the theory graph.
  The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a body of mathematical knowledge can be formalized in Alonzo using the little theories method. This is done by formalizing monoid theory -- the body of mathematical knowledge about monoids -- in Alonzo. Instead of using the standard approach to formal mathematics in which mathematics is done with the help of a proof assistant and all details are formally proved and mechanically checked, we employ an alternative approach in which everything is done within a formal logic but proofs are not required to be fully formal. The standard approach focuses on certification, while this alternative approach focuses on communication and accessibility.</description>

Abstract: We define the universal exponential extension of an algebraically closed differential field and investigate its properties in the presence of a nice valuation and in connection with linear differential equations. Next we prove normalization theorems for algebraic differential equations over $H$-fields, as a tool in solving such equations in suitable extensions. The results in this monograph are essential in our work on Hardy fields in [6].</description>
