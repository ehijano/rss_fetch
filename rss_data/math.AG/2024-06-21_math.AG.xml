      <title>Stratification of Derived Categories of Tate Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the localizing tensor ideals of the derived categories of mixed Tate motives over certain algebraically closed fields. More precisely, we prove that these categories are stratified in the sense of Barthel, Heard and Sanders. A key ingredient in the proof is the development of a new technique for transporting stratification between categories by means of Brown--Adams representability, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for the Grothendieck class of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain closed form expressions for the class in the Grothendieck group of varieties of the moduli space of genus $0$ stable curves with $n$ marked points. This information is equivalent to the Poincar\'e polynomial, so it implies explicit expressions for the Betti numbers of the moduli space in terms of Stirling numbers or, alternatively, Bernoulli numbers.
  The result is proved as a consequence of explicit expressions for the generating function for the Grothendieck class, which we prove by solving a differential equation characterizing this generating function by work of E. Getzler and Y. Manin from the 1990s. Our proof reduces the solution to two combinatorial identities which follow from applications of Lagrange series.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the triangulant of two matrices, and relate it to the existence of orthogonal eigenvectors. We also use it for a new characterization of mutually unbiased bases. Generalizing the notion, we introduce higher order triangulants of two matrices, and relate them to the existence of nontrivially intersecting invariant subspaces of complementary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that for all primes $p\not=2,3$, the Ramanujan vector field has an invariant algebraic curve and then we give a moduli space interpretation of this curve in terms of Cartier operator acting on the de Rham cohomology of elliptic curves. The main ingredients of our study are due to Serre, Swinnerton-Dyer and Katz in 1973. We aim to generalize this for the theory of Calabi-Yau modular forms, which includes the generating function of genus $g$ Gromov-Witten invariants. The integrality of $q$-expansions of such modular forms is still a main conjecture which has been only established for special Calabi-Yau varieties, for instance those whose periods are hypergeometric functions. For this the main tools are Dwork's theorem. We present an alternative project which aims to prove such integralities using modular vector fields and Gauss-Manin connection in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Conic bundle threefolds differing by a constant Brauer class and connections to rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A double cover $Y$ of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^2$ ramified over a general $(2,2)$-divisor will have the structure of a geometrically standard conic bundle ramified over a smooth plane quartic $\Delta \subset \mathbb{P}^2$ via the second projection. These threefolds are rational over algebraically closed fields, but over nonclosed fields, including over $\mathbb{R}$, their rationality is an open problem. In this paper, we characterize rationality over $\mathbb{R}$ when $\Delta(\mathbb{R})$ has at least two connected components (extending work of M. Ji and the second author) and over local fields when all odd degree fibers of the first projection have nonsquare discriminant.
  We obtain these applications by proving general results comparing the conic bundle structure on $Y$ with the conic bundle structure on a well-chosen intersection of two quadrics. The difference between these two conic bundles is encoded by a constant Brauer class, and we prove that this class measures a certain failure of Galois descent for the codimension 2 Chow group of $Y$.</description>

We study plurisubharmonic functions and the Monge--Amp\`ere operator defined on the finite energy class, partially generalizing a result of Boucksom--Jonsson on projective varieties.</description>

      <title>On the Saito number of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the \emph{Saito number} of a plane curve and we present a method to determine the minimal Saito number for plane curves in a given equisingularity class, that gives rise to an actual algorithm. In particular situations, we also provide various formulas for this number. In addition, if $\nu_0$ and $\nu_1$ are two coprime positive integers and $N&gt;0$ then we show that for any $1\leq k\leq \left [\frac{N\nu_0}{2}\right ]$ there exits a plane curve equisingular to the curve $$y^{N\nu_0}-x^{N\nu_1}=0$$ such that its Saito number is precisely $k$.</description>

      <title>The Unipotent Tropical Fundamental Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the unipotent tropical fundamental group of a polyhedral complex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the Tannakian fundamental group of the category of unipotent tropical vector bundles with integrable connection. We show that it is computable in that it satisfies a Seifert--Van Kampen theorem and has a description for fans in terms of a bar complex. We then review an analogous classical object, the unipotent de Rham fundamental group of a sch\"{o}n subvariety of a toric variety. Our main result is a correspondence theorem between classical and tropical unipotent fundamental groups: there is an isomorphism between the unipotent completion of the fundamental group of a generic fiber of a tropically smooth family over a disc and the tropical unipotent fundamental group of the family's tropicalization. This theorem is established using Kato--Nakayama spaces and a descent argument. It requires a slight enlargement of the relevant categories, making use of enriched structures and partial compactifications.</description>

      <title>A new formulation of regular singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an alternative definition for the familiar concept of regular singularity for meromorphic connections. Our new formulation does not use derived categories, and it also avoids the necessity of finding a special good filtration as in the formulation due to Kashiwara--Kawai. Moreover, our formulation provides an explicit algorithm to decide the regular singularity of a meromorphic connection. An important intermediary result, interesting in its own right, is that taking associated graded modules with respect to (not necessarily canonical) $V$-filtrations commutes with non-characteristic restriction. This allows us to reduce the proof of the equivalence of our formulation with the classical concept to the one-dimensional case. In that situation, we extend the well-known one-dimensional Fuchs criterion for ideals in the Weyl algebra to arbitrary holonomic modules over the Weyl algebra equipped with an arbitrary $(-1,1)$-filtration.</description>

      <title>The motive of the Hilbert scheme of points in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a closed formula for the generating function $\mathsf Z_d(t)$ of the motives $[\mathrm{Hilb}^d(\mathbb A^n)_0] \in K_0(\mathrm{Var}_{\mathbb C})$ of punctual Hilbert schemes, summing over $n$, for fixed $d&gt;0$. The result is an expression for $\mathsf Z_d(t)$ as the product of the zeta function of $\mathbb P^{d-1}$ and a polynomial $\mathsf P_d(t)$, which in particular implies that $\mathsf Z_d(t)$ is a rational function. Moreover, we reduce the complexity of $\mathsf P_d(t)$ to the computation of $d-8$ initial data, and therefore give explicit formulas for $\mathsf Z_d(t)$ in the cases $d \leq 8$, which in turn yields a formula for $[\mathrm{Hilb}^{\leq 8}(X)]$ for any smooth variety $X$. We perform a similar analysis for the Quot scheme of points, obtaining explicit formulas for the full generating function (summing over all ranks and dimensions) for $d \leq 4$. In the limit $n \to \infty$, we prove that the motives $[\mathrm{Hilb}^d(\mathbb A^n)_0]$ stabilise to the class of the infinite Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(d-1,\infty)$. Finally, exploiting our geometric methods, we conjecture (and partially confirm) a structural result on the 'error' measuring the discrepancy between the count of higher dimensional partitions and MacMahon's famous guess.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain two applications in different directions of algebra/algebraic geometry.
  The first application is a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  The second application is a commutativity criterion for operators in the Weyl algebra or, more generally, in the ring of ordinary differential operators, which we prove in the case when operators have a normal form with the restriction top line (for details see Introduction).
  Both applications are obtained with the help of normal forms. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a natural birational invariant for varieties over finite fields and show that its vanishing on projective space is equivalent to the Tate conjecture, the Beilinson conjecture, and the Grothendieck--Serre semi-simplicity conjecture for all smooth projective varieties over finite fields. We further show that the Tate, Beilinson, and 1-semi-simplicity conjecture in half of the degrees implies those conjectures in all degrees.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Symplectic Automorphisms of Supersingular K3 surfaces in Odd Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, Dolgachev-Keum classify finite groups of tame symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces in positive characteristics. They show all such groups are subgroups of the Mathieu group of degree 23. In this paper, we utilize lattice-theoretic methods to investigate symplectic actions of finite groups G on K3 surfaces in odd characteristics. In the tame cases (i.e., the order of G is coprime with p) and all the superspecial cases, one can associate with the action a Leech pair which can be detected via H\"ohn-Mason's list. Notice that the superspecial case has been recently resolved by Ohashi-Sch\"utt. If the K3 surface is supersingular with Artin invariant at least two, we develop a new machinery called p-root pairs to detect possible symplectic finite group actions (without the assumption of tameness). The concept of p-root pair is closely related to root systems and Weyl groups. In particular, we recover many results by Dolgachev-Keum with a different method and give an upper bound for the exponent of p in |G|.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a polynomial $p$ with no zeros in the polydisk, or equivalently the poly-upper half-plane, we study the problem of determining the ideal of polynomials $q$ with the property that the rational function $q/p$ is bounded near a boundary zero of $p$. We give a complete description of this ideal of numerators in the case where the zero set of $p$ is smooth and satisfies a non-degeneracy condition. In three variables, we give a description of the ideal in terms of an integral closure when $p$ has an isolated zero on the distinguished boundary. Constructions of multivariate stable polynomials are presented to illustrate sharpness of our results and necessity of our assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We prove a decomposition of the Hochschild homology groups of the equivariant dg category $\mathscr{C}^G$ associated to a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$ with direct sums on which a finite group $G$ acts. When the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ this decomposition is related to a categorical action of $\text{Rep}(G)$ on $\mathscr{C}^G$ and the resulting action of the representation ring $R_\mathbb{C}(G)$ on $HH_\bullet(\mathscr{C}^G)$.</description>

      <title>Isolated and parameterized points on curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained introduction to isolated points on curves and their counterpoint, parameterized points, that situates these concepts within the study of the arithmetic of curves. In particular, we show how natural geometric constructions of infinitely many degree $d$ points on curves motivate the definitions of $\mathbb{P}^1$- and AV-parameterized points and explain how a result of Faltings implies that there are only finitely many isolated points on any curve. We use parameterized points to deduce properties of the density degree set and review how the minimum density degree relates to the gonality. The paper includes several examples that illustrate the possible behaviors of degree $d$ points.</description>

      <title>Moduli of hybrid curves I: Variations of canonical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is the first in a series devoted to the study of asymptotic geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.
  We introduce the moduli space of hybrid curves as a new compactification of the moduli space of curves, refining the one obtained by Deligne and Mumford. This is the moduli space for multiscale geometric objects which mix complex and higher rank tropical and non-Archimedean geometries, reflecting both discrete and continuous features.
  We define canonical measures on hybrid curves which combine and generalize Arakelov-Bergman measures on Riemann surfaces and Zhang measures on metric graphs.
  We then show that the universal family of canonically measured hybrid curves over this moduli space varies continuously. This provides a precise link between the non-Archimedean Zhang measure and variations of Arakelov-Bergman measures in families of Riemann surfaces, answering a question which has been open since the pioneering work of Zhang on admissible pairing in the nineties.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general finiteness statement for the ordered abelian group of tropical functions on skeleta in Berkovich analytifications of algebraic varieties. Our approach consists in working in the framework of stable completions of algebraic varieties, a model-theoretic version of Berkovich analytifications, for which we prove a similar result, of which the former one is a consequence.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degrees and Zariski dense orbits of cohomologically hyperbolic maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dominant rational self-map on a projective variety is called $p$-cohomologically hyperbolic if the $p$-th dynamical degree is strictly larger than other dynamical degrees. For such a map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, we study lower bounds of the arithmetic degrees, existence of points with Zariski dense orbit, and finiteness of preperiodic points. In particular, we prove that, if $f$ is an $1$-cohomologically hyperbolic map on a smooth projective variety, then (1) the arithmetic degree of a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-point with generic $f$-orbit is equal to the first dynamical degree of $f$; and (2) there are $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points with generic $f$-orbit. Applying our theorem to the recently constructed rational map with transcendental dynamical degree, we confirm that the arithmetic degree can be transcendental.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16763v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate a family of ideal sheaves to any Q-effective divisor on a complex manifold, called the higher multiplier ideals, using the theory of mixed Hodge modules and V-filtrations. This family is indexed by two parameters, an integer indicating the Hodge level and a rational number, and these ideals admit a weight filtration. When the Hodge level is zero, they recover the usual multiplier ideals. We study the local and global properties of higher multiplier ideals systematically. In particular, we prove vanishing theorems and restriction theorems, and provide criteria for the nontriviality of the new ideals. The main idea is to exploit the global structure of the V-filtration along an effective divisor using the notion of twisted Hodge modules. In the local theory, we introduce the notion of the center of minimal exponent, which generalizes the notion of minimal log canonical center. As applications, we prove some cases of conjectures by Debarre, Casalaina-Martin and Grushevsky on singularities of theta divisors on principally polarized abelian varieties and the geometric Riemann-Schottky problem.</description>

      <title>Fibrations by Lagrangian tori for maximal Calabi-Yau degenerations and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct Lagrangian torus fibrations in degenerations of K\"ahler manifolds. We show that such torus fibrations naturally occur at the boundary of the A'Campo space. This space extends a degeneration over a punctured disc to a hybrid space involving its real oriented blowup and the dual complex of the special fiber; equipped with an exact modification of a given K\"ahler form which becomes fiberwise symplectic at the boundary. Therefore, it allows to move Lagrangian tori from the "radius zero" fibers at the boundary to the nearby fibers of the original generation using the symplectic connection. As a consequence, for any maximal Calabi-Yau degeneration we prove that a generic region of each nearby fiber admits a Lagrangian torus fibration with asymptotic properties expected from the (conjectural) Strominger--Yau--Zaslow fibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the image of the Hodge-Tate logarithm map (in any cohomological degree), defined by Heuer, in the case of smooth Stein varieties. Heuer, motivated by the computations for the affine space of any dimension, raised the question whether this image is always equal to the group of closed differential forms. We show that it indeed always contains such forms but the quotient can be non-trivial: it contains a slightly mysterious $Z_p$-module that maps, via the Bloch-Kato exponential map, to integral classes in the pro-\'etale cohomology. This quotient is already non-trivial for open unit discs of dimension strictly greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 8 parameters. We derive such a coordinatization of $J$ using fixed three complementary primitive idempotents and the associated Peirce decomposition of $J$.
  The second aim of this paper is to construct complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties (possibly allowing some coordinates with weight $0$). The affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and such weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold of genus $3$ with three $\frac{1}{2}(1,1,1)$-singularities belonging to the class of No.5.4 as in [Tak1] is constructed from one weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ such that all the coordinates have positive weights. Conversely, we also show that any such a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with the $C_{2}$-cluster variety constructed by Coughlan and Ducat [CD1], we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties are key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds belonging to 108 classes in the online database [GRDB].</description>

Abstract: Over qcqs finite-dimensional schemes, we prove that \'etale motives of geometric origin can be characterised by a constructibility property which is purely categorical, giving a full answer to the question "Do all constructible \'etale motives come from geometry?" which dates back to Cisinski and D\'eglise's work. We also show that they afford the continuity property and satisfy h-descent and Milnor excision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite subgroup. We introduce a class of projective noncommutative surfaces $\mathbb{P}^2_I$, indexed by a set of irreducible $\Gamma$-representations. Extending the action of $\Gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$, we show that these surfaces generalise both $[\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma]$ and $\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma$. We prove that isomorphism classes of framed torsion-free sheaves on any $\mathbb{P}^2_I$ carry a canonical bijection to the closed points of appropriate Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, we provide geometric interpretations for a class of Nakajima quiver varieties using noncommutative geometry. Our results partially generalise several previous results on such quiver varieties.</description>

Abstract: Section 10.4 of the 1998 Springer-Verlag book {\em Complexity and Real Computation}, by Blum, Cucker, Shub, and Smale, contains a particularly elegant proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: The central idea of the proof naturally leads to a homotopy continuation algorithm for finding the roots of univariate polynomials, and extends naturally to a proof of B\'{e}zout's Theorem (on the number of roots of systems of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns). We present a more detailed version of the BCSS Proof which is hopefully useful for students and researchers not familiar with algebraic geometry. So while there are no new results in this paper, the exposition is arguably more elementary. Any errors here are solely the responsibility of the current author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a graded triple $(M,R,I)$ in characteristic $p&gt;0$ by proving that for any complex number $y$, the limit
  $$\underset{n \to \infty}{\lim}(\frac{1}{p^n})^{\text{dim}(M)}\sum \limits_{j= -\infty}^{\infty}\lambda \left( (\frac{M}{I^{[p^n]}M})_j\right)e^{-iyj/p^n}$$ exists. We prove that the limiting function in the complex variable $y$ is entire and name this function the \textit{Frobenius-Poincar\'e function}. We establish various properties of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions including its relation with the tight closure of the defining ideal $I$; and relate the study Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions to the behaviour of graded Betti numbers of $\frac{R}{I^{[p^n]}} $ as $n$ varies. Our description of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions in dimension one and two and other examples raises questions on the structure of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions in general.</description>

      <title>GPU Accelerated Newton for Taylor Series Solutions of Polynomial Homotopies in Multiple Double Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polynomial homotopy is a family of polynomial systems, typically in one parameter $t$. Our problem is to compute power series expansions of the coordinates of the solutions in the parameter $t$, accurately, using multiple double arithmetic. One application of this problem is the location of the nearest singular solution in a polynomial homotopy, via the theorem of Fabry. Power series serve as input to construct Pad\'{e} approximations.
  Exploiting the massive parallelism of Graphics Processing Units capable of performing several trillions floating-point operations per second, the objective is to compensate for the cost overhead caused by arithmetic with power series in multiple double precision. The application of Newton's method for this problem requires the evaluation and differentiation of polynomials, followed by solving a blocked lower triangular linear system. Experimental results are obtained on NVIDIA GPUs, in particular the RTX 2080, RTX 4080, P100, V100, and A100.
  Code generated by the CAMPARY software is used to obtain results in double double, quad double, and octo double precision. The programs in this study are self contained, available in a public github repository under the GPL-v3.0 License.</description>

Abstract: We make a systematic study of matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers which are certain intersection numbers in the matroid Chow ring generalizing the mixed Eulerian numbers introduced by Postnikov. These numbers are shown to be valuative and obey a log-concavity relation. We establish recursion formulas and use them to relate matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers to the characteristic and Tutte polynomials, reproving results of Huh-Katz and Berget-Spink-Tseng. Generalizing Postnikov, we show that these numbers are equal to certain weighted counts of binary trees. Lastly, we study these numbers for perfect matroid designs, proving that they generalize the remixed Eulerian numbers of Nadeau-Tewari.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the integral canonical model $\mathscr{S}_{\mathsf{K}^p}$ of a Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$ of abelian type at hyperspecial level $K_0=\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we construct a prismatic $F$-gauge model for the `universal' $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-local system on $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$. We use this to obtain new $p$-adic information about these Shimura varieties, notably an abelian-type analogue of the Serre--Tate theorem (realizing an expectation of Drinfeld in the abelian-type case) and a prismatic characterization of these models. To do this, we make several advances in integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, notably the development of an integral analogue of the functor $D_{\mathrm{crys}}$.</description>

Abstract: It is known that a camera can be calibrated using three pictures of either squares, spheres, or surfaces of revolution. We give a new method to calibrate a camera with the picture of a single torus.</description>

      <title>Further results on orbits and incidence matrices for the class $\mathcal{O}_6$ of lines external to the twisted cubic in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature, lines of the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$ are partitioned into classes, each of which is a union of line orbits under the stabilizer group of the twisted cubic. The least studied class is named $\mathcal{O}_6$. This class contains lines external to the twisted cubic which are not its chords or axes and do not lie in any of its osculating planes. For even and odd $q$, we propose a new family of orbits of $\mathcal{O}_6$ and investigate in detail their stabilizer groups and the corresponding submatrices of the point-line and plane-line incidence matrices. To obtain these submatrices, we explored the number of solutions of cubic and quartic equations connected with intersections of lines (including the tangents to the twisted cubic), points, and planes in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$.</description>

      <title>Topological Applications of p-Adic Divergence and Gradient Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $p$-Adic divergence and gradient operators are constructed giving rise to $p$-adic vertex Laplacian operators used by Z\'u\~niga in order to study Turing patterns on graphs, as well as their edge Laplacian counterparts. It is shown that the Euler characteristic of a finite graph can be expressed via traces of certain heat kernels associated with these new operators. This result is applied to the extraction of topological information from Mumford curves via heat kernels.</description>
