      <title>Minimizing Dissipation via Interacting Environments: Quadratic Convergence to Landauer Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental limits on thermodynamic irreversibility when cooling a quantum system in the presence of a finite-size reservoir. First, we prove that for any non-interacting $n$-particle reservoir, the entropy production $\Sigma$ decays at most linearly with $n$. Instead, we derive a cooling protocol in which $\Sigma \propto 1/n^2$, which is in fact the best possible scaling. This becomes possible due to the presence of interactions in the finite-size reservoir, which must be prepared at the verge of a phase transition. Our results open the possibility of cooling with a higher energetic efficiency via interacting reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Classical versus quantum queries in quantum PCPs with classical proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize quantum-classical PCPs, first introduced by Weggemans, Folkertsma and Cade (TQC 2024), to allow for $q$ quantum queries to a polynomially-sized classical proof ($\mathsf{QCPCP}_{Q,c,s}[q]$). Exploiting a connection with the polynomial method, we prove that for any constant $q$, promise gap $c-s = \Omega(1/\text{poly}(n))$ and $\delta&gt;0$, we have $\mathsf{QCPCP}_{Q,c,s}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCPCP}_{1-\delta,1/2+\delta}[3] \subseteq \mathsf{BQ} \cdot \mathsf{NP}$, where $\mathsf{BQ} \cdot \mathsf{NP}$ is the class of promise problems with quantum reductions to an $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problem. Surprisingly, this shows that we can amplify the promise gap from inverse polynomial to constant for constant query quantum-classical PCPs, and that any quantum-classical PCP making any constant number of quantum queries can be simulated by one that makes only three classical queries. Nevertheless, even though we can achieve promise gap amplification, our result also gives strong evidence that there exists no constant query quantum-classical PCP for $\mathsf{QCMA}$, as it is unlikely that $\mathsf{QCMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQ} \cdot \mathsf{NP}$, which we support by giving oracular evidence. In the (poly-)logarithmic query regime, we show for any positive integer $c$, there exists an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{QCPCP}[\mathcal{O}(\log^c n)] \subsetneq \mathsf{QCPCP}_Q[\mathcal{O}(\log^c n)]$, contrasting the constant query case where the equivalence of both query models holds relative to any oracle. Finally, we connect our results to more general quantum-classical interactive proof systems.</description>

      <title>Indefinite causal order in boxworld theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An astonishing feature of higher-order quantum theory is that it can accommodate indefinite causal order. In the simplest bipartite setting, there exist signaling correlations for which it is fundamentally impossible to ascribe a definite causal order for the parties' actions. Moreover, the assumptions required to arrive at such a statement (local quantum transformations and well-behaved probabilities) result in a nontrivial set of correlations, whose boundary is, to date, uncharacterized. In this work, we investigate indefinite causal order in boxworld theories. We construct a higher-order theory whose descriptor is the generalized bit (gbit) - the natural successor of the classical bit and quantum qubit. By fixing the local transformations in boxworld and asking about the global causal structure, we find that we trivially recover the full set of two-way signaling correlations. In light of this, we motivate and propose two physical principles in order to limit the set of achievable correlations: nonsignaling preservation and no signaling without system exchange. We find that a higher-order boxworld theory that respects these physical principles leads to (i) a nontrivial set of achievable correlations and (ii) a violation of some causal inequalities that is higher than what can be achieved in higher-order quantum theory. These results lead us to conjecture that the set of correlations of our higher-order boxworld theory is an outer approximation to the set of correlations produced by higher-order quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Classical mechanics as the high-entropy limit of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that classical mechanics can be recovered as the high-entropy limit of quantum mechanics. That is, the high entropy masks quantum effects, and mixed states of high enough entropy can be approximated with classical distributions. The mathematical limit $\hbar \to 0$ can be reinterpreted as setting the zero entropy of pure states to $-\infty$, in the same way that non-relativistic mechanics can be recovered mathematically with $c \to \infty$. Physically, these limits are more appropriately defined as $S \gg 0$ and $v \ll c$. Both limits can then be understood as approximations independently of what circumstances allow those approximations to be valid. Consequently, the limit presented is independent of possible underlying mechanisms and of what interpretation is chosen for both quantum states and entropy.</description>

      <title>Low-degree approximation of QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QAC$^0$ is the class of constant-depth quantum circuits with polynomially many ancillary qubits, where Toffoli gates on arbitrarily many qubits are allowed. In this work, we show that the parity function cannot be computed in QAC$^0$, resolving a long-standing open problem in quantum circuit complexity more than twenty years old. As a result, this proves ${\rm QAC}^0 \subsetneqq {\rm QAC}_{\rm wf}^0$. We also show that any QAC circuit of depth $d$ that approximately computes parity on $n$ bits requires $2^{\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$ ancillary qubits, which is close to tight. This implies a similar lower bound on approximately preparing cat states using QAC circuits. Finally, we prove a quantum analog of the Linial-Mansour-Nisan theorem for QAC$^0$. This implies that, for any QAC$^0$ circuit $U$ with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, and for any $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, the correlation between $Q(x)$ and the parity function is bounded by ${1}/{2} + 2^{-\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$, where $Q(x)$ denotes the output of measuring the output qubit of $U|x,0^a\rangle$. All the above consequences rely on the following technical result. If $U$ is a QAC$^0$ circuit with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, then there is a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of bounded polynomials of degree polylog$(n)$ such that with high probability, a random polynomial from $\mathcal{D}$ approximates the function $\langle x,0^a| U^\dag Z_{n+1} U |x,0^a\rangle$ for a large fraction of $x\in \{0,1\}^n$. This result is analogous to the Razborov-Smolensky result on the approximation of AC$^0$ circuits by random low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.</description>

      <title>Self-interaction induced phase modulation for directed current, energy diffusion and quantum scrambling in a Floquet ratchet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wavepacket dynamics in an interacting Floquet system described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a ratchet potential. Under quantum resonance conditions, we thoroughly examine the exotic dynamics of directed current, mean energy, and quantum scrambling, based on the exact expression of a time-evolving wavepacket. The directed current is controlled by the phase of the ratchet potential and remains independent of the self-interaction strength. Interestingly, the phase modulation induced by self-interaction dominates the quadratic growth of both mean energy and Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators (OTOCs). In the quantum nonresonance condition, the disorder in momentum space, induced by the pseudorandom feature of the free evolution operator, suppresses the directed current at all times. Meanwhile, the disorder also leads to the dynamical localization of the mean energy and the freezing of quantum scrambling for initially finite time interval. The dynamical localization can be effectively manipulated by the phase, with underlying physics rooted in the different quasi-eigenenergy spectrum modulated by ratchet potential. Both the mean energy and OTOCs exponentially increase after long time evolution, which is governed by the classically chaotic dynamics dependent on the self-interaction. Possible applications of our findings on quantum control are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01081v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum technologies calls for the design and deployment of quantum-safe cryptographic protocols and communication networks. There are two primary approaches to achieving quantum-resistant security: quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While each offers unique advantages, both have drawbacks in practical implementation. In this work, we introduce the pros and cons of these protocols and explore how they can be combined to achieve a higher level of security and/or improved performance in key distribution. We hope our discussion inspires further research into the design of hybrid cryptographic protocols for quantum-classical communication networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Potato Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine qubit states under symmetric informationally-complete measurements, representing state vectors as probability 4-vectors within a 3-simplex in $bb(R)^4$. Using geometric transformations, this 3-simplex is mapped to a tetrahedron in $bb(R)^3$. A specific surface within this tetrahedron allows for the separation of probability vectors into two disjoint 1-simplices. The intersection of this surface with the insphere identifies a "quantum potato chip" region, where probability 4-vectors reduce to two binary classical variables. States within this region can be fully reconstructed using only two given projective measurements, a feature not found elsewhere in the state space.</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid PQC-QKD protocols with enhanced security and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01086v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Circuit Compilations for a Continuously Parameterized Two-Qubit Gateset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors are currently implemented across a variety of hardware platforms, each with their own distinct gatesets. As such, circuit compilation should not only be aware of, but also deeply connect to, the native gateset and noise properties of each. Trapped-ion processors are one such platform that provides a gateset that can be continuously parameterized across both one- and two-qubit gates. Here we use the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT) to study noise-aware compilations focused on continuously parameterized two-qubit $\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates (based on the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen interaction) using $\textbf{Superstaq}$, a quantum software platform for hardware-aware circuit compiler optimizations. We discuss the realization of $\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates with arbitrary angle on the all-to-all connected trapped-ion system. Then we discuss a variety of different compiler optimizations that innately target these $\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates and their noise properties. These optimizations include moving from a restricted maximally entangling gateset to a continuously parameterized one, swap mirroring to further reduce total entangling angle of the operations, focusing the heaviest $\mathcal{ZZ}$ angle participation on the best performing gate pairs, and circuit approximation to remove the least impactful $\mathcal{ZZ}$ gates. We demonstrate these compilation approaches on the hardware with randomized quantum volume circuits, observing the potential to realize a larger quantum volume as a result of these optimizations. Using differing yet complementary analysis techniques, we observe the distinct improvements in system performance provided by these noise-aware compilations and study the role of stochastic and coherent error channels for each compilation choice.</description>

      <title>Efficient explicit circuit for quantum state preparation of piece-wise continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to effectively upload data onto quantum states is an important task with broad applications in quantum computing. Numerous quantum algorithms heavily rely on the ability to efficiently upload information onto quantum states, without which those algorithms cannot achieve quantum advantage. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a method to upload a polynomial function $f(x)$ on the interval $x \in (a, b)$ onto a pure quantum state consisting of qubits, where a discretised $f(x)$ is the amplitude of this state. The preparation cost has quadratic scaling in the number of qubits $n$ and linear scaling with the degree of the polynomial $Q$. This efficiency allows the preparation of states whose amplitudes correspond to high-degree polynomials, enabling the approximation of almost any continuous function. We introduce an explicit algorithm for uploading such functions using four real polynomials that meet specific parity and boundedness conditions. We also generalize this approach to piece-wise polynomial functions, with the algorithm scaling linearly with the number of piecewise parts. Our method achieves efficient quantum circuit implementation and we present detailed gate counting and resource analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal energy storage and collective charging speedup in the central-spin quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit principles of quantum mechanics to accelerate the charging process and aim to achieve optimal energy storage. However, analytical results for investigating these problems remain lacking due to the challenges associated with nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we analytically investigate a central-spin QB model in which $N_b$ spin-1/2 battery cells interact with $N_c$ spin-1/2 charger units, using $m$ initially excited charger units as a resource. By employing the invariant subspace method and the shifted Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation, we identify four scenarios in which optimal energy storage can be achieved: 1) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!\ll\!N_c$; 2) $m\!\ll\!N_b\!\ll\!N_c$; 3) $m\!\ll\!N_c\!\ll\!N_b$; and 4) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!=\!kN_c$ [$k\!\in\!(0,1)$]. In these cases, optimal storage is ensured by the SU(2) symmetry emerging from the charging dynamics. The first three cases map the central-spin QB to different Tavis-Cummings (TC) QBs, while the fourth corresponds to the non-TC limit. We analytically determine the charging time and demonstrate that in the fully charging cases (1) and (4), the collective charging exhibits an $N_b$-fold enhancement in speedup compared to the parallel charging scheme. Additionally, we numerically observe a unified charging behavior when $m\!=\!N_c$, showing that asymptotically optimal energy storage is possible when $N_b\!=\!m\!=\!N_c$. In this case, we find a collective charging enhancement scaling as $N_b^{0.8264}$. Our results highlight the crucial role of dynamically emergent SU(2) symmetry in providing an analytical understanding of non-equilibrium charging dynamics in QBs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, traditional cryptographic security measures, including token obfuscation, are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks. This paper introduces a quantum-enhanced approach to token obfuscation leveraging quantum superposition and multi-basis verification to establish a robust defense against these threats. In our method, tokens are encoded in superposition states, making them simultaneously exist in multiple states until measured, thus enhancing obfuscation complexity. Multi-basis verification further secures these tokens by enforcing validation across multiple quantum bases, thwarting unauthorized access. Additionally, we incorporate a quantum decay protocol and a refresh mechanism to manage the token life-cycle securely. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in token security and robustness, validating this approach as a promising solution for quantum-secure cryptographic applications. This work not only highlights the feasibility of quantum-based token obfuscation but also lays the foundation for future quantum-safe security architectures.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Design of Approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding holds promise for continuous-variable fault-tolerant quantum computing. While an ideal GKP encoding is abstract and impractical due to its nonphysical nature, approximate versions provide viable alternatives. Conventional approximate GKP codewords are superpositions of multiple {large-amplitude} squeezed coherent states. This feature ensures correctability against single-photon loss and dephasing {at short times}, but also increases the difficulty of preparing the codewords. To minimize this trade-off, we utilize a neural network to generate optimal approximate GKP states, allowing effective error correction with just a few squeezed coherent states. We find that such optimized GKP codes outperform the best conventional ones, requiring fewer squeezed coherent states, while maintaining simple and generalized stabilizer operators. Specifically, the former outperform the latter with just \textit{one third} of the number of squeezed coherent states at a squeezing level of 9.55 dB. This optimization drastically decreases the complexity of codewords while improving error correctability.</description>

      <title>Reducing T-Count in quantum string matching algorithm using relative-phase Fredkin gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string-matching problem, ubiquitous in computer science, can significantly benefit from quantum algorithms due to their potential for greater efficiency compared to classical approaches. The practical implementation of the quantum string matching (QSM) algorithm requires fault-tolerant quantum computation due to the fragility of quantum information. A major obstacle in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation is the high cost associated with executing T gates. This paper introduces the relative-phase Fredkin gate as a strategy to notably reduce the number of T gates (T-count) necessary for the QSM algorithm. This reduces the T-count from 14N^(3/2) log_2 N-O(N^(3/2)) to 8N^(3/2) log_2 N-O(N^(3/2)), where N represents the size of the database to be searched. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is advantageous in terms of other circuit costs, such as the depth of T gates and the number of CNOT gates. This advancement contributes to the ongoing development of the QSM algorithm, paving the way for more efficient solutions in the field of computer science.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Locality in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of us recently proposed an entanglement-based witness of non-classicality, which can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity in what is known as the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) effect. The witness is based on this idea: if a system can create entanglement between two quantum probes by local means only, then it must be non-classical. In this note we discuss the role of locality as an assumption for the theorem supporting the witness; we also discuss other related notions of locality and comment on their mutual relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors to large qubit counts faces challenges in control signal delivery, thermal management, and hardware complexity, particularly in achieving microwave signal multiplexing and long-distance quantum information routing at millikelvin (mK) temperatures. We propose a space-time modulated Josephson Junction (JJ) metasurface architecture to generate and multiplex microwave control signals directly at mK temperatures. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the generation of multiple frequency tones with controlled parameters, enabling efficient and scalable qubit control while minimizing thermal loads and wiring overhead. We derive the nonlinear wave equation governing this system, simulate beam steering and frequency conversion, and discuss the feasibility of experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Quantum Computing for Large-scale Linear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As industrial models and designs grow increasingly complex, the demand for optimal control of large-scale dynamical systems has significantly increased. However, traditional methods for optimal control incur significant overhead as problem dimensions grow. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end quantum algorithm for linear-quadratic control with provable speedups. Our algorithm, based on a policy gradient method, incorporates a novel quantum subroutine for solving the matrix Lyapunov equation. Specifically, we build a quantum-assisted differentiable simulator for efficient gradient estimation that is more accurate and robust than classical methods relying on stochastic approximation. Compared to the classical approaches, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end quantum application to linear control problems with provable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Dimension Independent and Computationally Efficient Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new shadow tomography algorithm that uses $n=\Theta(\sqrt{m}\log m/\epsilon^2)$ samples, for $m$ measurements and additive error $\epsilon$, which is independent of the dimension of the quantum state being learned. This stands in contrast to all previously known algorithms that improve upon the naive approach. The sample complexity also has optimal dependence on $\epsilon$. Additionally, this algorithm is efficient in various aspects, including quantum memory usage (possibly even $O(1)$), gate complexity, classical computation, and robustness to qubit measurement noise. It can also be implemented as a read-once quantum circuit with low quantum memory usage, i.e., it will hold only one copy of $\rho$ in memory, and discard it before asking for a new one, with the additional memory needed being $O(m\log n)$. Our approach builds on the idea of using noisy measurements, but instead of focusing on gentleness in trace distance, we focus on the \textit{gentleness in shadows}, i.e., we show that the noisy measurements do not significantly perturb the expected values.</description>

      <title>Rapidly mixing loop representation quantum Monte Carlo for Heisenberg models on star-like bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have proven invaluable in condensed matter physics, particularly for studying ground states and thermal equilibrium properties of quantum Hamiltonians without a sign problem. Over the past decade, significant progress has also been made on their rigorous convergence analysis.
  Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM) with bipartite interaction graphs are a popular target of computational QMC studies due to their physical importance, but despite the apparent empirical efficiency of these simulations it remains an open question whether efficient classical approximation of the ground energy is possible in general. In this work we introduce a ground state variant of the stochastic series expansion QMC method, and for the special class of AFM on interaction graphs with an $O(1)$-bipartite component (star-like), we prove rapid mixing of the associated QMC Markov chain (polynomial time in the number of qubits) by using Jerrum and Sinclair's method of canonical paths. This is the first Markov chain analysis of a practical class of QMC algorithms with the loop representation of Heisenberg models.
  Our findings contribute to the broader effort to resolve the computational complexity of Heisenberg AFM on general bipartite interaction graphs.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground state preparation in ab initio electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative engineering is a powerful tool for quantum state preparation, and has drawn significant attention in quantum algorithms and quantum many-body physics in recent years. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using the Lindblad dynamics to efficiently prepare the ground state for general ab initio electronic structure problems on quantum computers, without variational parameters. These problems often involve Hamiltonians that lack geometric locality or sparsity structures, which we address by proposing two generic types of jump operators for the Lindblad dynamics. Type-I jump operators break the particle number symmetry and should be simulated in the Fock space. Type-II jump operators preserves the particle number symmetry and can be simulated more efficiently in the full configuration interaction space. For both types of jump operators, we prove that in a simplified Hartree-Fock framework, the spectral gap of our Lindbladian is lower bounded by a universal constant. For physical observables such as energy and reduced density matrices, the convergence rate of our Lindblad dynamics with Type-I jump operators remains universal, while the convergence rate with Type-II jump operators only depends on coarse grained information such as the number of orbitals and the number of electrons. To validate our approach, we employ a Monte Carlo trajectory-based algorithm for simulating the Lindblad dynamics for full ab initio Hamiltonians, demonstrating its effectiveness on molecular systems amenable to exact wavefunction treatment.</description>

      <title>Observation of freezing phenomenon in high-dimensional quantum correlation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing (QIP) based on high-dimensional quantum systems provides unique advantages and new potentials where high-dimensional quantum correlations (QCs) play vital roles. Exploring the resistance of QCs against noises is crucial as QCs are fragile due to complex and unavoidable system-environment interactions. In this study, we investigate the performance of high-dimensional QCs under local dephasing noise using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. A freezing phenomenon in the high-dimensional quantum discord dynamics was observed, showing discord is robust against local dephasing noise. Utilizing a robustness metric known as freezing index, we found that the discord of qutrits outperforms their qubits counterpart when confronted with dephasing noise. Furthermore, we developed a geometric picture to explain this intriguing freezing phenomenon phenomenon. Our findings highlight the potential of utilizing discord as a physical resource for advancing QIP in high-dimensional quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Genuine non-Gaussian entanglement: quantum correlations beyond Hong-Ou-Mandel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is an important demonstration of particle indistinguishability, when identical single photons interfere at a beamsplitter to generate the two-photon entangled NOON state. On the other hand, NOON states with $N\ge3$ photons have long been conjectured beyond the deterministic generation of photon interference. To characterize the separation, we introduce the notion of genuine non-Gaussian entanglement (NGE), which cannot be generated via a generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, with Gaussian protocols extending the beamsplitter and separable input states replacing the single photons. We establish a resource theory to characterize such quantum correlations beyond Hong-Ou-Mandel and prove that NOON states with $N\ge 3$ are indeed among the NGE class. With the generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel protocol as free operations, we introduce two monotones to characterize genuine non-Gaussian entanglement: one derived from the entanglement entropy and the other from the minimal extension size required to convert a state into a free state. Finally, we demonstrate that the tomography process of pure free states can be performed efficiently, while all learning protocols of states with genuine non-Gaussian entanglement require exponential overheads connected to the monotone. This implies that states generated in Boson sampling are efficiently learnable despite its measurement statistics being hard to sample from.</description>

      <title>Collective Dissipation of Oscillator Dipoles Strongly Coupled to 1-D Electromagnetic Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective dissipative dynamics of dipoles modeled as harmonic oscillators coupled to 1-D electromagnetic reservoirs. The bosonic nature of the dipole oscillators as well as the reservoir modes allows an exact numerical simulation of the dynamics for arbitrary coupling strengths. At weak coupling, apart from essentially recovering the dynamics expected from a Markovian Lindblad master equation, we also obtain non-Markovian effects for spatially separated two-level emitters. In the so called ultrastrong coupling regime, we find the dynamics and steady state depends on the choice of the reservoir which is chosen as either an ideal cavity with equispaced, unbounded dispersion or a cavity array with a bounded dispersion. Moreover, at even higher coupling strengths, we find a decoupling between the light and matter degrees of freedom attributable to the increased importance of the diamagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. In this regime, we find that the dependence of the dynamics on the separation between the dipoles is not important and the dynamics is dominated by the occupation of the polariton mode of lowest energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria in pure strategies for quantum approach to the Prisoner's Dilemma. The quantization process involves extending the classical game by introducing two additional unitary strategies. We consider five classes of such quantum games, which remain invariant under isomorphic transformations of the classical game. For each class, we identify and analyse all possible Nash equilibria. Our results reveal the complexity and diversity of strategic behaviour in the quantum setting, providing new insights into the dynamics of classical decision-making dilemmas. In the case of the standard Prisoner's Dilemma, the resulting Nash equilibria of quantum extensions are found to be closer to Pareto optimal solutions than those of the classical equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We explore a notion of decomposably divisible (D-divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56, 485202 (2023). Both necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for highly-symmetric qubit and qudit dynamical maps. Through a restructurization of the evolution generators, we encode the decomposable divisibility into the positivity of time-dependent coefficients that multiply generators of D-divisible dynamical maps. This provides an analogy to the CP-divisibility property, which is equivalent to the positivity of decoherence rates that multiply Markovian semigroup generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QMA is the class of languages that can be decided by an efficient quantum verifier given a quantum witness, whereas QCMA is the class of such languages where the efficient quantum verifier only is given a classical witness. A challenging fundamental goal in quantum query complexity is to find a classical oracle separation for these classes. In this work, we offer a new approach towards proving such a separation that is qualitatively different than prior work, and show that our approach is sound assuming a natural statistical conjecture which may have other applications to quantum query complexity lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Implementation of Non-Positive-Operator-Valued Measurements in General Probabilistic Theories by Post-Selected POVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important problem to clarify the class of implementable quantum measurements from both fundamental and applicable viewpoints. Positive-Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurements are implementable by the indirect measurement methods, and the class is the largest class determined by the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. However, if we assume probabilistic consistency in our operations instead of the structure of Hilbert space, we can deal with Non-Positive-Operator-Valued Measure (N-POVM) measurements in the framework of General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). N-POVM measurements are not considered as implementable, but this paper gives a constructive way to implement N-POVM measurements by POVM measurements and post-selection in quantum theory when we restrict the domain of target states. Besides, we show that a post-selected POVM measurement is regarded as an N-POVM measurement in a restricted domain. These results provide a new relationship between N-POVM measurements in GPTs and post-selection.</description>

      <title>Magic states are rarely the most important resource to optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scaling approach to evaluating the qubit resources required by concatenated fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach gives closed-form expressions, which remain simple for multiple levels of concatenation, making it an ideal tool to compare and minimize the resource costs of different concatenation schemes. We then use it to study the resources required for normal and magic operations. Here, magic operations require the preparation, verification and injection of complicated states called "magic states", while normal operations do not. It is often expected that magic operations will dominate a computation's physical resource requirements (qubits, gates, etc.), although this expectation has been cast in doubt for surface codes. Our results show that this expectation is also wrong for typical concatenated codes, with magic operations rarely being costly. We give concrete examples for the concatenated 7-qubit scheme with Steane error-correction gadgets or a flag-qubits approach. While optimizations that affect all operations are naturally more effective than ones that affect only magic operations, the surprising conclusion of our work is that the former can reduce costs by several orders of magnitude whereas the latter contributes only marginal reductions. This is particularly surprising given the numerous works on optimizations that affect only magic operations.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a Chern insulator: topological signature and long-range repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Polder interaction between a two-level atomic system and a Chern insulator for both the resonant and nonresonant channels. For a right circularly polarized excited atomic state near a Chern insulator with a negative Chern number $C$, the resonant Casimir-Polder force can be monotonically repulsive over a large range of separations. In the presence of the same Chern insulator, a right circularly polarized metastable atomic state is expected to experience a repulsive nonresonant Casimir-Polder force over a certain range of atom-surface separations in the far-field region. At still greater separations, the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force is expected to become attractive and exhibit a topological signature, being proportional to $(C\alpha)^2/(1+(C\alpha)^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Theory of Molecules: Rigour, Idealization, and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Philosophers have claimed that: (a) the Born-Oppenheimer approximation methods for solving molecular Schr\"odinger equations violate the Heisenberg uncertainty relations; therefore (b) so-called `quantum chemistry' is not fully quantum; and so (c) chemistry does not reduce to physics. This paper analyses the reasoning behind Born-Oppenheimer methods and shows that they are internally consistent and fully quantum mechanical, contrary to (a)-(c). Our analysis addresses important issues of mathematical rigour, physical idealisation, reduction, and classicality in the quantum theory of molecules, and we propose an agenda for the philosophy of quantum chemistry more solidly grounded in scientific practice.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi relative entropy based monogamy of entanglement in tripartite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive investigation of the entanglement characteristics is carried out on tripartite spin-1/2 systems, examining prototypical tripartite states, the thermal Heisenberg model, and the transverse field Ising model. The entanglement is computed using the R\'enyi relative entropy. In the traditional R\'enyi relative entropy, the generalization parameter $\alpha$ can take values only in the range $0 \leq \alpha \leq 2$ due to the requirements of joint convexity of the measure. To use the R\'enyi relative entropy over a wider range of $\alpha$, we use the sandwiched form which is jointly convex in the regime $0.5 \leq \alpha \leq \infty$. In prototypical tripartite states, we find that GHZ states are monogamous, but surprisingly so are W states. On the other hand, star states exhibit polygamy, due to the higher level of purity of the bipartite subsystems. For spin models, we study the dependence of entanglement on various parameters such as temperature, spin-spin interaction, and anisotropy, and identify regions where entanglement is the largest. The R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ scales the amount of entanglement in the system. The entanglement measure based on the traditional and the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies obey the Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality. In the Heisenberg models, namely the XYZ, XXZ, and XY models, the system is always monogamous. However, in the transverse field Ising model, the state is initially polygamous and becomes monogamous with temperature and coupling.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms. We prove the separation for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law in interacting bosons: from Bose-Hubbard, $\phi$4, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement area law is a universal principle that characterizes the information structure in quantum many-body systems and serves as the foundation for modern algorithms based on tensor network representations. Historically, the area law has been well understood under two critical assumptions: short-range interactions and bounded local energy. However, extending the area law beyond these assumptions has been a long-sought goal in quantum many-body theory. This challenge is especially pronounced in interacting boson systems, where the breakdown of the bounded energy assumption is universal and poses significant difficulties. In this work, we prove the area law for one-dimensional interacting boson systems including the long-range interactions. Our model encompasses the Bose-Hubbard class and the $\phi4$ class, two of the most fundamental models in quantum condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. This result achieves the resolution of the area law that incorporates both the challenges of unbounded local energy and long-range interactions in a unified manner. Additionally, we establish an efficiency-guaranteed approximation of the quantum ground states using Matrix Product States (MPS). These results significantly advance our understanding of quantum complexity by offering new insights into how bosonic parameters and interaction decay rates influence entanglement. Our findings provide crucial theoretical foundations for simulating long-range interacting cold atomic systems, which are central to modern quantum technologies, and pave the way for more efficient simulation techniques in future quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli counts much lower than commonly considered molecular simulations in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Generation of high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a driven hybrid quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a theoretical scheme for achieving long-distance Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a driven hybrid quantum system. By applying a microwave field to the YIG sphere, we utilize the Kerr effect to induce the squeezing of the magnon, thereby achieving an exponential enhancement of the coupling strength between the magnonic mode and spins, and we also discuss in detail the relationship between the squeezing parameter and the external microwave field. By means of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, the magnonic mode can be adiabatically eliminated under the large detuning condition, thereby establishing a robust effective interaction between spins essential for realizing the desired entangled state. Numerical simulations indicate that the squeezing parameter can be effectively increased by adjusting the driving field, and our proposal can generate high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states even in dissipative systems. Additionally, we extensively discuss the influence of inhomogeneous broadening on the entangled states, and the experimental feasibility shows that our results provide possibilities in the realms of quantum networking and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Modelling Realistic Multi-layer devices for superconducting quantum electronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neural networks (NNs) have become a powerful tool for detecting quantum phases of matter. Unfortunately, NNs are black boxes and only identify phases without elucidating their properties. Novel physics benefits most from insights about phases, traditionally extracted in spin systems using spin correlators. Here, we combine two approaches and design TetrisCNN, a convolutional NN with parallel branches using different kernels that detects the phases of spin systems and expresses their essential descriptors, called order parameters, in a symbolic form based on spin correlators. We demonstrate this on the example of snapshots of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model taken in various bases. We show also that TetrisCNN can detect more complex order parameters using the example of two-dimensional Ising gauge theory. This work can lead to the integration of NNs with quantum simulators to study new exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Tolerant Quantum Junta Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Junta testing for Boolean functions has sparked a long line of work over recent decades in theoretical computer science, and recently has also been studied for unitary operators in quantum computing. Tolerant junta testing is more general and challenging than the standard version. While optimal tolerant junta testers have been obtained for Boolean functions, there has been no knowledge about tolerant junta testers for unitary operators, which was thus left as an open problem in [Chen, Nadimpalli, and Yuen, SODA2023]. In this paper, we settle this problem by presenting the first algorithm to decide whether a unitary is $\epsilon_1$-close to some quantum $k$-junta or is $\epsilon_2$-far from any quantum $k$-junta, where an $n$-qubit unitary $U$ is called a quantum $k$-junta if it only non-trivially acts on just $k$ of the $n$ qubits. More specifically, we present a tolerant tester with $\epsilon_1 = \frac{\sqrt{\rho}}{8} \epsilon$, $\epsilon_2 = \epsilon$, and $\rho \in (0,1)$, and the query complexity is $O\left(\frac{k \log k}{\epsilon^2 \rho (1-\rho)^k}\right)$, which demonstrates a trade-off between the amount of tolerance and the query complexity. Note that our algorithm is non-adaptive which is preferred over its adaptive counterparts, due to its simpler as well as highly parallelizable nature. At the same time, our algorithm does not need access to $U^\dagger$, whereas this is usually required in the literature.</description>

      <title>Optimal recoil-free state preparation in an optical atom tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing in atom tweezers requires high-fidelity implementations of quantum operations. Here, we demonstrate the optimal implementation of the transition $|0\rangle \rightarrow |1\rangle$ of two levels, serving as a qubit, of an atom in a tweezer potential, driven by a single-photon Rabi pulse. The Rabi pulse generates a photon recoil of the atom, due to the Lamb-Dicke coupling between the internal and motional degree of freedom, driving the system out of the logical subspace. This detrimental effect is strongly suppressed in the protocols that we propose. Using pulse engineering, we generate optimal protocols composed of a Rabi protocol and a force protocol, corresponding to dynamically displacing the tweezer. We generate these for a large parameter space, from small to large values of the Rabi frequency, and a range of pulse lengths. We identify three main regimes for the optimal protocols, and discuss their properties. In all of these regimes, we demonstrate infidelity well below the current technological standard, thus mitigating a universal challenge in atom tweezers and other quantum technology platforms.</description>

      <title>The Di\'osi-Penrose model of classical gravity predicts gravitationally induced entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dynamics of the Di\'osi-Penrose (DP) model of classical gravity can entangle the mechanical degrees of freedom of two separate particles. For standard experiments of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE), we find that entanglement can be generated iff the particles are separated by a distance smaller than some limiting value $d_c$, proportional to the only free parameter of the DP model. Greater distances can be achieved through new experimental configurations, where the initial wave-function of the particles is allowed to spread perpendicularly (as opposed to parallely) to the spatial axis separating them. Although the DP dynamics asymptotically drives the system to a separable state, we observe that, for reasonable experimental parameters, GIE can survive for more than a day. In the context of the debate on the nature of gravity, our results prove that experimental demonstrations of GIE are insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum.</description>

      <title>Programmable Quantum Processors: Equivalence and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the work, the equivalence of quantum deterministic and probabilistic processors was investigated. A programmable quantum processor is a device able to transform input data states in a desired way. Deterministic equivalence as well as three types of probabilistic equivalences - strong, weak, and structural - were defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for deterministic and structural equivalence of unitarily related processors were discovered. Equivalence of deterministic SWAP processor for two-dimensional data and two-dimensional program space was completely solved. It was found that spans of operators of structurally equivalent processors are identical. Relations between types of individual equivalences were also examined.
  In the second part, robustness of probabilistic storing and retrieval device (PSAR), originally optimized for implementing a phase gate, to noise was examined - specifically to depolarization and phase damping. In the case of a depolarizing channel mixed with a unitary channel, the device implements noisy channel with the probability that decreases with an increasing number of times the given channel is applied. In the case of the phase damping channel, the device implements noisy channel with the same probability as the original PSAR device optimized for phase gate. Concrete implementations - through the Vidal-Masanes-Cirac scheme and virtual qudit - were examined. Vidal-Masanes-Cirac gives the same result for both noisy channels which is better than the result from PSAR. Implementation through virtual qudit for depolarization yields worse probability of successful measurement than Vidal-Masanes-Cirac. However, it is still better than the probability for PSAR. Probability of successful measurement obtained for phase damping implemented through virtual qudit is the same as for Vidal-Masanes-Cirac and PSAR.</description>

      <title>Enhanced non-macrorealism: Extreme violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities for a system evolving under superposition of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory contravenes classical macrorealism by allowing a system to be in a superposition of two or more physically distinct states, producing physical consequences radically different from that of classical physics. We show that a system, upon subjecting to transform under superposition of unitary operators, exhibits enhanced non-macrorealistic feature - as quantified by violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) beyond the temporal Tsirelson bound. Moreover, this superposition of unitaries also provides robustness against decoherence by allowing the system to violate LGI and thereby retain its non-macrorealistic behavior for a strikingly longer duration. Using an NMR register, we experimentally demonstrate the superposition of unitaries with the help of an ancillary qubit and verify these theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Multimode Displaced Squeezed State in High-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation is a resource of extremely broad frequency combs of ultrashort light pulses. The non-classical nature of this new quantum source has been recently evidenced in semiconductors by showing that high harmonic generation generates multimode squeezed states of light. Applications in quantum information science require the knowledge of the mode structure of the created states, defining how the quantum properties distribute over the spectral modes. To achieve that, an effective Schmidt decomposition of the reduced photonic state is performed on a tripartite harmonic set by simultaneously measuring the second- and third-order intensity correlation function. A relatively high Schmidt number is predicated which indicates a rich mode structure, a useful resource in quantum technology. By modelling our data with a multimode displaced squeezed state, we retrieve the dependencies of the measured correlation as a function of the high harmonic driving laser intensity. The effective high-harmonic mode distribution is retrieved, and the strength of the contributing squeezing modes is estimated. Additionally, we demonstrate a significant violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz-type inequality for three biseparable partitions by multiple standard deviations. Our results confirm and extend the analysis of non-classical properties in semiconductor high-harmonic generation. The source operates at room temperature with compact lasers, and it could become a useful resource for future applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Information plane and compression-gnostic feedback in quantum machine learning</title>

Abstract: The information plane (Tishby et al. arXiv:physics/0004057, Shwartz-Ziv et al. arXiv:1703.00810) has been proposed as an analytical tool for studying the learning dynamics of neural networks. It provides quantitative insight on how the model approaches the learned state by approximating a minimal sufficient statistics. In this paper we extend this tool to the domain of quantum learning models. In a second step, we study how the insight on how much the model compresses the input data (provided by the information plane) can be used to improve a learning algorithm. Specifically, we consider two ways to do so: via a multiplicative regularization of the loss function, or with a compression-gnostic scheduler of the learning rate (for algorithms based on gradient descent). Both ways turn out to be equivalent in our implementation. Finally, we benchmark the proposed learning algorithms on several classification and regression tasks using variational quantum circuits. The results demonstrate an improvement in test accuracy and convergence speed for both synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, with one example we analyzed the impact of the proposed modifications on the performances of neural networks in a classification task.</description>

      <title>Diamagnetic micro-chip traps for levitated nanoparticle entanglement experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Gravity Mediated Entanglement (QGEM) protocol offers a novel method to probe the quantumness of gravitational interactions at non-relativistic scales. This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\mathcal{O}(\sim \mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At large quantum numbers, the probability densities for particle-in-a-box or simple harmonic oscillator converge to the classical result upon coarse-graining the quantum mechanical probability densities by introducing a finite resolution in the measurement of the particle's position. This resolution in the position can be related to the resolution of the secondary total angular momentum quantum number ($m$) when interpreting the probabilistic outcomes of the Stern--Gerlach-type thought experiments for large values of the angular momentum quantum numbers ($j$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum detailed balance is formulated in terms of elementary transitions, in close analogy to detailed balance in a classical Markov chain on a finite set of points. An elementary transition is taken to be a pure state of two copies of the quantum system, as a quantum analogue of an ordered pair of classical points representing a classical transition from the first to the second point. This form of quantum detailed balance is shown to be equivalent to standard quantum detailed balance with respect to a reversing operation, thus providing a new conceptual foundation for the latter. Aspects of parity in quantum detailed balance are clarified in the process.</description>

      <title>Noisy Stark probes as quantum-enhanced sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wannier-Stark localization has been proven to be a resource for quantum-enhanced sensitivity with super-Heisenberg scaling. An extremely promising feature of such probes are their ability to showcase such enhanced scaling even dynamically with system size, on top of the quadratic scaling in time. In this work, we address the issue of decoherence that occurs during evolution and characterize how that affects the sensing performance. We determine the parameter domains in which the enhancement is sustained under dephasing dynamics. As the open system dynamics is closely connected to evolution under an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we consider two such scenarios that can be engineered in an experiment. The first one is a trace-preserving dynamical description and shows the existence of quantum-enhanced sensitivity. The second one considers a non-Hermitian lattice where the presence of super-Heisenberg sensitivity further proves that quantum advantages of the Stark probes indeed can be sustained during noisy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimates of trace distance between bosonic Gaussian states and applications to learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian states of bosonic quantum systems enjoy numerous technological applications and are ubiquitous in nature. Their significance lies in their simplicity, which in turn rests on the fact that they are uniquely determined by two experimentally accessible quantities, their first and second moments. But what if these moments are only known approximately, as is inevitable in any realistic experiment? What is the resulting error on the Gaussian state itself, as measured by the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, namely, the trace distance? In this work, we fully resolve this question by demonstrating that if the first and second moments are known up to an error $\varepsilon$, the trace distance error on the state also scales as $\varepsilon$, and this functional dependence is optimal. To prove this, we establish tight bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments. As an application, we improve existing bounds on the sample complexity of tomography of Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the polynomial hierarchy is infinite, we prove a sufficient condition for determining if uniform and polynomial size quantum circuits over a non-universal gate set are not efficiently classically simulable in the weak multiplicative sense. Our criterion exploits the fact that subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ are essentially either discrete or dense in $\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{C})$. Using our criterion, we give a new proof that both instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits and conjugated Clifford circuits (CCCs) afford a quantum advantage. We also prove that both commuting CCCs and CCCs over various fragments of the Clifford group afford a quantum advantage, which settles two questions of Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Koh. Our results imply that circuits over just $(U^\dagger \otimes U^\dagger) \mathrm{CZ} (U \otimes U)$ afford a quantum advantage for almost all $U \in \mathrm{U}(2)$.</description>

      <title>LDPC stabilizer codes as gapped quantum phases: stability under graph-local perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the proof of stability of topological order, due to Bravyi, Hastings and Michalakis, to stabilizer Hamiltonians corresponding to low-density parity check (LDPC) codes without the restriction of geometric locality in Euclidean space. We consider Hamiltonians $H_0$ defined by $[[N,K,d]]$ LDPC codes which obey certain topological quantum order conditions: (i) code distance $d \geq c \log(N)$, implying local indistinguishability of ground states, and (ii) a mild condition on local and global compatibility of ground states; these include good quantum LDPC codes, and the toric code on a hyperbolic lattice, among others. We consider stability under weak perturbations that are quasi-local on the interaction graph defined by $H_0$, and which can be represented as sums of bounded-norm terms. As long as the local perturbation strength is smaller than a finite constant, we show that the perturbed Hamiltonian has well-defined spectral bands originating from the $O(1)$ smallest eigenvalues of $H_0$. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue has $2^K$ states, is separated from the rest of the spectrum by a finite energy gap, and has exponentially narrow bandwidth $\delta = C N e^{-\Theta(d)}$, which is tighter than the best known bounds even in the Euclidean case. We also obtain that the new ground state subspace is related to the initial code subspace by a quasi-local unitary, allowing one to relate their physical properties. Our proof uses an iterative procedure that performs successive rotations to eliminate non-frustration-free terms in the Hamiltonian. Our results extend to quantum Hamiltonians built from classical LDPC codes, which give rise to stable symmetry-breaking phases. These results show that LDPC codes very generally define stable gapped quantum phases, even in the non-Euclidean setting, initiating a systematic study of such phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: Bilayer graphene twisted at the angle of about 1.1{\deg} better known as magic angle, exhibits ultra-flat moir\'e superlattice bands that are a source of highly-tunable, exotic quantum phenomena. Such phenomena, like superconductivity, correlated Mott-like insulating states and orbital ferromagnetism are driven by strong-correlation physics that defies classical theories. The inadequacy of such classical models and the lack of theoretical understanding of the recently observed exotic phenomena calls for revisiting the theory behind the material system and associating it with the observed behaviour. This article reviews the physics behind twisted bilayer graphene, focusing primarily on moir\'e physics and the importance of electronic (flat) band structure. In addition, this paper provides a brief overview of the emerging phenomena of correlated insulating states, superconductivity and orbital ferromagnetism. Finally, the most recent developments in controlling the interaction-driven states and tuning the electronic interactions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum of a bipartite quantum system is given by the distribution of eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian. In this work, we compute the entanglement spectrum in the vacuum state for a subregion of a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) admitting a holographic dual. In the case of a spherical (or planar) entangling surface, we recover known results in two dimensions, including the Cardy formula in the high energy regime. In higher dimensions $d&gt;2$, we analytically determine a generalization of the Cardy formula valid at large energies and consistent with previous studies of CFT spectra in the literature. We also investigate numerically the spectrum at energy levels far above the modular ground state energy. We extend our analysis to the supersymmetric point of Einstein-Maxwell gravity, providing exact results when $d=2,3$, and a generalization of the Cardy formula at high energies in generic dimension $d$. We consider small shape deformations of a spherical entangling surface, for both the non-supersymmetric and the supersymmetric cases. In all cases we find that the high-energy scaling of the microcanonical entropy with the modular energy is unaffected by the shape deformation. This result suggests that the high-energy regime of the entanglement spectra carries universal information, independent of the shape of the entangling surface.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Determining Ground State Energy of Protocatechuic Acid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising hybrid algorithm, utilizing both quantum and classical computers to obtain the ground state energy of molecules. In this context, this study applies VQE to investigate the ground state of protocatechuic acid, analyzing its performance with various Ans\"atze and active spaces. Subsequently, all VQE results were compared to those obtained with the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The results demonstrate that Ans\"atze, like unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) and variations of Hardware-Efficient, generally achieve accuracy close to that of HF. Furthermore, the increase in active space has led to the models becoming more difficult to converge to values with a greater distance from the correct energy. In summary, the findings of this study reinforce the use of VQE as a powerful tool for analyzing molecular ground state energies. Finally, the results underscore the critical importance of Ansatz selection and active space size in VQE performance, providing valuable insights into its potential and limitations.</description>

      <title>Finite Entanglement Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, which is the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite entanglement scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite entanglement scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., proportional to boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-from symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1D (QED2) shares intriguing properties with QCD, including confinement, string breaking, and interesting phase diagram when the non-trivial topological $\theta$-term is considered. Its lattice regularization is a commonly used toy model for quantum simulations of gauge theories on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we address algorithms for adiabatic state preparation in digital quantum simulations of QED2. We demonstrate that, for specific choices of parameters, the existing adiabatic procedure leads to level crossing between states of different charge sectors, preventing the correct preparation of the ground state. We further propose a new adiabatic Hamiltonian and verify its efficiency in targeting systems with a nonzero topological $\theta$-term and in studying string breaking phenomena.</description>

Abstract: For photon-spin conversion, the Ge hole system in a strained GeSi/Ge quantum well with a diamond structure has attracted significant attention because of the potential for a high-performance spin qubit and optical transitions ranging in telecom bands. We calculated the electron g-factor for strained Ge, analyzing its dependence on both the growth directions ([100], [110], and [111]) and the Ge content of the SiGe substrate using an 8-band model. Our results indicate that the absolute values of the electron g-factor decrease with decreasing Ge content, ranging from approximately -3.0 to -1.4 for all growth directions.</description>

      <title>Towers of Quantum Many-body Scars from Integrable Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several models with multiple quantum many-body scars (QMBS) using integrable boundary states~(IBS). We focus on the tilted N\'eel states, which are parametrized IBS of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and show that these states can be used to construct a tower of scar states. Our models exhibit periodic revival dynamics, showcasing a characteristic behavior of superpositions of QMBS. Furthermore, the tower of QMBS found in this study possesses a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) structure, indicating that QMBS are equally spaced in energy. This approach can be extended to two-dimensional models, which can be decomposed into an array of one-dimensional models. In this case, the tilted N\'eel states again serve as parent states for multiple scar states. These states demonstrate low entanglement entropy, marking them as exact scar states. Notably, their entanglement entropy adheres to the sub-volume law, further solidifying the nonthermal properties of QMBS. Our results provide novel insights into constructing QMBS using IBS, thereby illuminating the connection between QMBS and integrable models.</description>

      <title>A novel Kagome uud-ddu spin order in Heisenberg spin-1/2 Clinoatacamite Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, the parent compound of Herbertsmithite</title>

Abstract: The newly identified field-induced up-up-down order in Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ etc. renewed attention on exotic phases in spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnets. Here, we report a unique zero-field noncoplanar up,up,down, down,down,up Kagome spin order in spin-1/2 antiferromagnet Clinoatacamite, Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$, which consists of weakly-coupled Kagome layers and was known as the parent compound for the most researched spin liquid candidate Herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. The two-dimensional uud-ddu Kagome order develops below T$_{N1}$ = 18.1 K in Clinoatacamite before a further transition into a three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures below T$_{N2}$ ~ 6.4 K with persistent spin fluctuations. The present work reveals a new unpredicted Kagome order in a readily accessible temperature range in the parent compound of a well-studied spin liquid. In addition, it has also solved a puzzling issue for a mysterious magnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Quark jet evolution: from classical to quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark jet provides one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to the hot quark-gluon plasma. In this proceeding paper, we review a series of works on the development of nonperturbative computational framework of in-medium quark jet evolution, from classical to quantum simulation. The application of the time-dependent Basis Light-front Quantization (tBLFQ), a nonperturbative computational approach based on light-front Hamiltonian formalism, to in-medium jet evolution enables a fully quantum treatment to the jet state on the amplitude level. Based on the tBLFQ framework, with applying novel quantum technologies, we have constructed a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe within a stochastic color background field. With the obtained simulation results, we extracted the medium induced modification in terms of jet momentum broadening and gluon production. These studies provide a baseline for future works of in-medium jet evolution using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Electrical Interconnects for Silicon Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable spin qubit devices will likely require long-range qubit interconnects. We propose to create such an interconnect with a resistive topgate. The topgate is positively biased, to form a channel between the two dots; an end-to-end voltage difference across the nanowire results in an electric field that propels the electron from source dot to target dot. The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.</description>

      <title>Pulsation of quantum walk on Johnson graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a phenomenon of discrete-time quantum walks on graphs called the pulsation, which is a generalization of a phenomenon in the quantum searches. This phenomenon is discussed on a composite graph formed by two connected graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. The pulsation means that the state periodically transfers between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ with the initial state of the uniform superposition on $G_1$. In this paper, we focus on the case for the Grover walk where $G_{1}$ is the Johnson graph and $G_{2}$ is a star graph. Also, the composite graph is constructed by identifying an arbitrary vertex of the Johnson graph with the internal vertex of the star graph. In that case, we find the pulsation with $O(\sqrt{N^{1+1/k}})$ periodicity, where $N$ is the number of vertices of the Johnson graph. The proof is based on Kato's perturbation theory in finite-dimensional vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Resolved Relative Entropy of Random States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use large-$N$ diagrammatic techniques to calculate the relative entropy of symmetric random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble. These methods are specifically designed for symmetric sectors, allowing us to determine the relative entropy for random states exhibiting $U(1)$ symmetry. This calculation serves as a measure of distinguishability within the symmetry sectors of random states. Our findings reveal that the symmetry-resolved relative entropy of random pure states displays universal statistical behavior. Furthermore, we derive the symmetry-resolved Page curve. These results deepen our understanding of the properties of these random states.</description>

      <title>Spin migration in density functional theory: energy, potential and density perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flip, magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, the KS potentials and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze five standard exchange-correlation functionals and find three main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, and the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security.
  In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Approach to Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramsey theory enables re-shaping of the basic ideas of quantum mechanics. Quantum observables represented by linear Hermitian operators are seen as the vertices of a graph. Relations of commutation define the coloring of edges linking the vertices: if the operators commute, they are connected with a red link; if they do not commute, they are connected with a green link. Thus, a bi-colored complete Ramsey graph emerges. According to Ramsey's theorem, a complete bi-colored graph built of six vertices will inevitably contain at least one monochromatic triangle; in other words, the Ramsey number \( R(3,3) = 6 \). In our interpretation, this triangle represents the triad of observables that could or could not be established simultaneously in a given quantum system. The Ramsey approach to quantum mechanics is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Single-Atomic-Ensemble Dual-Wavelength Optical Standard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual wavelength optical frequency standard based on the dual optical transition modulation transfer spectroscopy (DOTMTS) between different quantum transitions of the rubidium D1 (795 nm) and D2 (780 nm) lines. In a single rubidium atomic ensemble, modulation frequency sidebands from the 780 nm pump beam are simultaneously transferred to both the 780 nm and 795 nm probe lasers. The DOTMTS enables the simultaneous stabilization of 780 nm and 795 nm lasers on a single vapor cell. Both lasers exhibit a frequency instability in the low 10 ^(-14) range at 1 s of averaging, as estimated from the residual error signal. A theoretical model is developed based on the V type atomic level structure to illustrate the dual-wavelength spectroscopy. This approach can be extended to develop a multiwavelength optical frequency standard within a single atomic ensemble, broadening its applicability in fields such as precision metrology, wavelength standards, optical networks, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: General spin-1/2 chains with symmetric nearest-neighbor interaction are studied. We rigorously prove that all spin models in this class, except for known integrable systems, are non-integrable in the sense that they possess no nontrivial local conserved quantities. This result confirms that there are no missing integrable systems, i.e., integrable systems in this class are exactly those that are already known. In addition, this result excludes the possibility of intermediate systems which have a finite number of nontrivial local conserved quantities. Our findings support the expectation that integrable systems are exceptional in quantum many-body systems and most systems are non-integrable.</description>

      <title>Small-scale Hamiltonian optimization of interpolating operators for Lagrangian lattice quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice quantum field theory calculations may potentially combine the advantages of Hamiltonian formulations with the scalability and control of conventional Lagrangian frameworks. However, such hybrid approaches need to consider (1) the differences in renormalized coupling values between the two formulations, and (2) finite-volume and discretization effects when the Hamiltonian component of the calculation is characterized by a smaller volume or coarser lattice spacing than the Lagrangian component. This work investigates the role of both factors in the application of Hamiltonian-optimized interpolating operator constructions for the conventional Lagrangian framework. The numerical investigation is realized for the pseudoscalar meson in the Schwinger model, using tensor-network and Monte-Carlo calculations. It is demonstrated that tensor-network-optimized constructions are robust to both (1) and (2). In particular, accurate optimized constructions for the pseudoscalar meson can be obtained from calculations with a smaller number of Hamiltonian lattice sites, even when the meson mass itself receives significant finite-volume corrections. To the extent that these results generalize to theories with more complicated spectra, the method holds promise for near-term applications in large-scale calculations of lattice quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical challenge for density functional theory (DFT) in practice is its limited ability to treat static electron correlation, leading to errors in its prediction of charges, multiradicals, and reaction barriers. Recently, we combined one- and two-electron reduced density matrix theories with DFT to obtain a universal $O(N^3)$ generalization of DFT for static correlation. In this Letter, we enhance the theory's treatment of large molecules by renormalizing the trace of the two-electron identity matrix in the correction using Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities of the electron-electron repulsion matrix. We apply the resulting functional theory to linear hydrogen chains as well as the prediction of the singlet-triplet gap and equilibrium geometries of a series of acenes. This renormalization of the generalized DFT retains the $O(N^{3})$ computational scaling of DFT while enabling the accurate treatment of static correlation for a broad range of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Diverging entanglement of critical magnons in easy-axis antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) has been established in quantum chemistry as a powerful tool for studying the nonlinear response and nonequilibrium dynamics of molecular systems. More recently, the technique has also been applied to correlated electron materials, where the interplay of localized and itinerant states makes the interpretation of the spectra more challenging. Here we use the Keldysh contour representation of effective models and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory to systematically study the MDCS signals of prototypical correlated lattice systems. By analyzing the current induced by sequences of ultrashort laser pulses we demonstrate the usefulness of MDCS as a diagnostic tool for excitation pathways and coherent processes in correlated solids. We also show that this technique allows to extract detailed information on the nature and evolution of photo-excited nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Optical Quantum Memories Using Long-Lived Noble-Gas Spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear spins of noble gases exhibit exceptionally long coherence times and can potentially serve as a long-lived storage medium for quantum information. We analyze and compare the performance of two mechanisms for mapping the quantum state of light onto the collective spin state of noble gases. The first mechanism utilizes collisional exchange with the electronic spin state of metastable noble-gas atoms, while the second relies on spin-exchange collisions with ground-state alkali-metal atoms. We describe the operation of an optical quantum memory relying on these two mechanisms using a compact model and study strategies that optimize the memory storage efficiency. Through numerical simulations, we identify optimal sequences for storing optical signals with different signal bandwidths and electronic spin relaxation rates. This work highlights the qualitative difference between the two approaches for using noble gases as long-lived quantum memories at non-cryogenic conditions and outlines the regimes in which they are expected to be efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce multipartite intrinsic non-locality as a method for quantifying resources in the multipartite scenario of device-independent (DI) conference key agreement. We prove that multipartite intrinsic non-locality is additive, convex, and monotone under a class of free operations called local operations and common randomness. As one of our technical contributions, we establish a chain rule for two variants of multipartite mutual information, which we then use to prove that multipartite intrinsic non-locality is additive. This chain rule may be of independent interest in other contexts. All of these properties of multipartite intrinsic non-locality are helpful in establishing the main result of our paper: multipartite intrinsic non-locality is an upper bound on secret key rate in the general multipartite scenario of DI conference key agreement. We discuss various examples of DI conference key protocols and compare our upper bounds for these protocols with known lower bounds. Finally, we calculate upper bounds on recent experimental realizations of DI quantum key distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced state disturbance is a major challenge in obtaining quantum statistics at multiple time points. We propose a method to extract dynamic information from a quantum system at intermediate time points, namely snapshotting quantum dynamics. To this end, we apply classical post-processing after performing the ancilla-assisted measurements to cancel out the impact of the measurements at each time point. Based on this, we reconstruct a multi-time quasi-probability distribution (QPD) that correctly recovers the probability distributions at the respective time points. Our approach can also be applied to simultaneously extract exponentially many correlation functions with various time-orderings. We provide a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of the proposed protocol using a dual-species trapped-ion system by employing $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{138}\rm{Ba}^+$ ions as the system and the ancilla, respectively. Multi-time measurements are performed by repeated initialization and detection of the ancilla state without directly measuring the system state. The two- and three-time QPDs and correlation functions are reconstructed reliably from the experiment, negativity and complex values in the QPDs clearly indicate a contribution of the quantum coherence throughout dynamics.</description>

      <title>Duality theory for Clifford tensor powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation theory of the Clifford group is playing an increasingly prominent role in quantum information theory, including in such diverse use cases as the construction of protocols for quantum system certification, quantum simulation, and quantum cryptography. In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n: Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the eta-correspondence). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t=4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the eta correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a trapped-ion quantum computer with 30 qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are rapidly becoming more capable, with dramatic increases in both qubit count and quality. Among different hardware approaches, trapped-ion quantum processors are a leading technology for quantum computing, with established high-fidelity operations and architectures with promising scaling. Here, we demonstrate and thoroughly benchmark the IonQ Forte system: configured as a single-chain 30-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer with all-to-all operations. We assess the performance of our quantum computer operation at the component level via direct randomized benchmarking (DRB) across all 30 choose 2 = 435 gate pairs. We then show the results of application-oriented benchmarks and show that the system passes the suite of algorithmic qubit (AQ) benchmarks up to #AQ 29. Finally, we use our component-level benchmarking to build a system-level model to predict the application benchmarking data through direct simulation. While we find that the system-level model correlates with the experiment in predicting application circuit performance, we note quantitative discrepancies indicating significant out-of-model errors, leading to higher predicted performance than what is observed. This highlights that as quantum computers move toward larger and higher-quality devices, characterization becomes more challenging, suggesting future work required to push performance further.</description>

      <title>More quantum chemistry with fewer qubits</title>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, and molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favorable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Scalable architecture for trapped-ion quantum computing using RF traps and dynamic optical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubits based on ions trapped in linear radio-frequency traps form a successful platform for quantum computing, due to their high fidelity of operations, all-to-all connectivity and degree of local control. In principle there is no fundamental limit to the number of ion-based qubits that can be confined in a single 1D register. However, in practice there are two main issues associated with long trapped-ion crystals, that stem from the 'softening' of their modes of motion, upon scaling up: high heating rates of the ions' motion, and a dense motional spectrum; both impede the performance of high-fidelity qubit operations. Here we propose a holistic, scalable architecture for quantum computing with large ion-crystals that overcomes these issues. Our method relies on dynamically-operated optical potentials, that instantaneously segment the ion-crystal into cells of a manageable size. We show that these cells behave as nearly independent quantum registers, allowing for parallel entangling gates on all cells. The ability to reconfigure the optical potentials guarantees connectivity across the full ion-crystal, and also enables efficient mid-circuit measurements. We study the implementation of large-scale parallel multi-qubit entangling gates that operate simultaneously on all cells, and present a protocol to compensate for crosstalk errors, enabling full-scale usage of an extensively large register. We illustrate that this architecture is advantageous both for fault-tolerant digital quantum computation and for analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Scaling Whole-Chip QAOA for Higher-Order Ising Spin Glass Models on Heavy-Hex Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show through numerical simulation that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for higher-order, random-coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from $16$ up to $127$ qubits for $p=1$ up to $p=5$, which allows for straight-forward transfer learning of QAOA angles on instance sizes where exhaustive grid-search is prohibitive even for $p&gt;1$. We use Matrix Product State (MPS) simulation at different bond dimensions to obtain confidence in these results, and we obtain the optimal solutions to these combinatorial optimization problems using CPLEX. In order to assess the ability of current noisy quantum hardware to exploit such parameter concentration, we execute short-depth QAOA circuits (with a CNOT depth of 6 per $p$, resulting in circuits which contain $1420$ two qubit gates for $127$ qubit $p=5$ QAOA) on $100$ higher-order (cubic term) Ising models on IBM quantum superconducting processors with $16, 27, 127$ qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single $16$-qubit instance. We show that (i) the best quantum processors generally find lower energy solutions up to $p=3$ for 27 qubit systems and up to $p=2$ for 127 qubit systems and are overcome by noise at higher values of $p$, (ii) the best quantum processors find mean energies that are about a factor of two off from the noise-free numerical simulation results. Additional insights from our experiments are that large performance differences exist among different quantum processors even of the same generation and that dynamical decoupling significantly improve performance for some, but decrease performance for other quantum processors. Lastly we show $p=1$ QAOA angle mean energy landscapes computed using up to a $414$ qubit quantum computer, showing that the mean QAOA energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size changes.</description>

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers face a critical limitation in qubit numbers, hindering their progression towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A significant challenge impeding scaling is crosstalk, characterized by unwanted interactions among neighboring components on quantum chips, including qubits, resonators, and substrate. We motivate a general approach to systematically resolving multifaceted crosstalks in a limited substrate area. We propose Qplacer, a frequency-aware electrostatic-based placement framework tailored for superconducting quantum computers, to alleviate crosstalk by isolating these components in spatial and frequency domains alongside compact substrate design. Qplacer commences with a frequency assigner that ensures frequency domain isolation for qubits and resonators. It then incorporates a padding strategy and resonator partitioning for layout flexibility. Central to our approach is the conceptualization of quantum components as charged particles, enabling strategic spatial isolation through a 'frequency repulsive force' concept. Our results demonstrate that Qplacer carefully crafts the physical component layout in mitigating various crosstalk impacts while maintaining a compact substrate size. On various device topologies and NISQ benchmarks, Qplacer improves fidelity by an average of 36.7x and reduces spatial violations (susceptible to crosstalk) by an average of 12.76x, compared to classical placement engines. Regarding area optimization, compared to manual designs, Qplacer can reduce the required layout area by 2.14x on average</description>

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the capabilities of variational quantum algorithms are greatly constrained due to a limited number of qubits and the shallow depth of quantum circuits. We may view these variational quantum algorithms as weak learners in supervised learning. Ensemble methods are general approaches to combining weak learners to construct a strong one in machine learning. In this paper, by focusing on classification, we theoretically establish and numerically verify a learning guarantee for quantum adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). The supervised-learning risk bound describes how the prediction error of quantum AdaBoost on binary classification decreases as the number of boosting rounds and sample size increase. We further empirically demonstrate the advantages of quantum AdaBoost by focusing on a 4-class classification. The quantum AdaBoost not only outperforms several other ensemble methods, but in the presence of noise it can also surpass the ideally noiseless but unboosted primitive classifier after only a few boosting rounds. Our work indicates that in the current NISQ era, introducing appropriate ensemble methods is particularly valuable in improving the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Despite the high measurement fidelity that can now be reached, the dispersive qubit readout of circuit quantum electrodynamics is plagued by a loss of its quantum nondemolition character and a decrease in fidelity with increased measurement strength. In this work, we elucidate the nature of this dynamical process, which we refer to as transmon ionization. We develop a comprehensive framework which provides a physical picture of the origin of transmon ionization. This framework consists of three complementary levels of descriptions: a fully quantized transmon-resonator model, a semiclassical model where the resonator is treated as a classical drive on the transmon, and a fully classical model. Crucially, all three approaches preserve the full cosine potential of the transmon and lead to similar predictions. This framework identifies the multiphoton resonances responsible for transmon ionization. It also allows one to efficiently compute numerical estimates of the photon number threshold for ionization, which are in remarkable agreement with recent experimental results. The tools developed within this work are both conceptually and computationally simple, and we expect them to become an integral part of the theoretical underpinning of all circuit QED experiments.</description>

      <title>Born's rule from epistemic assumptions</title>

Abstract: Born's rule is the recipe for calculating probabilities from quantum mechanical amplitudes. There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This principle of "ontological completeness" means, for example, that the probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this principle of "ontological minimalism" gives rise to wrong predictions. Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment. Rather, some elements of this structure emerge from the analysis.</description>

      <title>Local Quantum Search Algorithm for Random $k$-SAT with $\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ Clauses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random k-SAT instances undergo a "phase transition" from being generally satisfiable to unsatisfiable as the clause number m passes a critical threshold, $r_k n$. This causes a drastic reduction in the number of satisfying assignments, shifting the problem from being generally solvable on classical computers to typically insolvable. Beyond this threshold, it is challenging to comprehend the computational complexity of random k-SAT. In quantum computing, Grover's search still yields exponential time requirements due to the neglect of structural information.
  Leveraging the structure inherent in search problems, we propose the k-local quantum search algorithm, which extends quantum search to structured scenarios. Grover's search, by contrast, addresses the unstructured case where k=n. Given that the search algorithm necessitates the presence of a target, we specifically focus on the problem of searching the interpretation of satisfiable instances of k-SAT, denoted as max-k-SSAT. If this problem is solvable in polynomial time, then k-SAT can also be solved within the same complexity. We demonstrate that, for small $k \ge 3$, any small $\epsilon&gt;0$ and sufficiently large n:
  $\cdot$ k-local quantum search achieves general efficiency on random instances of max-k-SSAT with $m=\Omega(n^{2+\delta+\epsilon})$ using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iterations, and
  $\cdot$ k-local adiabatic quantum search enhances the bound to $m=\Omega(n^{1+\delta+\epsilon})$ within an evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
  In both cases, the circuit complexity of each iteration is $\mathcal{O}(n^k)$, and the efficiency is assured with overwhelming probability $1 - \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{erfc}(n^{\delta/2}))$. By modifying this algorithm capable of solving all instances of max-k-SSAT, we further prove that max-k-SSAT is polynomial on average when $m=\Omega(n^{2+\epsilon})$ based on the average-case complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Understanding and utilizing the inner bonds of process tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs) enable numerically exact simulations for an unprecedentedly broad range of open quantum systems. By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications.</description>

      <title>Speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations for quantum systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians play a crucial role in describing open quantum systems and nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we derive trade-off relations for systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on the Margolus-Levitin-type and Mandelstam-Tamm-type bounds, which are originally derived as quantum speed limits in isolated quantum dynamics. While the quantum speed limit for the Mandelstam-Tamm bound in general non-Hermitian systems was derived in the literature, we obtain a Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit for continuous measurement using the continuous matrix product state formalism. Moreover, we derive a Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit in the non-Hermitian setting. We derive additional bounds on the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of an observable, which take the same form as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. As an example, we apply these bounds to the continuous measurement formalism in open quantum dynamics, where the dynamics is described by discontinuous jumps and smooth evolution induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our work provides a unified perspective on the quantum speed limit and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics from the viewpoint of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, extending the results of previous studies.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse. A simple set of projective measurements can capture the quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Realism about quantum theory naturally leads to realism about the quantum state of the universe. It leaves open whether it is a pure state represented by a wave function, or an impure (mixed) one represented by a density matrix. I characterize and elaborate on Density Matrix Realism, the thesis that the universal quantum state is objective but can be impure. To clarify the thesis, I compare it with Wave Function Realism, explain the conditions under which they are empirically equivalent, consider two generalizations of Density Matrix Realism, and answer some frequently asked questions. I end by highlighting an implication for scientific realism.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum circuits for exponential of Pauli strings and Hamiltonian simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design quantum circuits for the exponential of scaled $n$-qubit Pauli strings using single-qubit rotation gates, Hadamard gate, and CNOT gates. A key result we derive is that any two Pauli-string operators composed of identity and $X$ gates are permutation similar, and the corresponding permutation matrices are product of CNOT gates, with the $n$-th qubit serving as the control qubit. Consequently, we demonstrate that the proposed circuit model for exponential of any Pauli-string is implementable on low-connected quantum hardware and scalable i.e. quantum circuits for $(n+1)$-qubit systems can be constructed from $n$-qubit circuits by adding additional quantum gates and the extra qubit. We then apply these circuit models to approximate unitary evolution for several classes of Hamiltonians using the Suzuki-Trotter approximation. These Hamiltonians include $2$-sparse block-diagonal Hamiltonians, Ising Hamiltonians, and both time-independent and time-dependent Random Field Heisenberg Hamiltonians and Transverse Magnetic Random Quantum Ising Hamiltonians. Simulations for systems of up to 18 qubits show that the circuit approximation closely matches the exact evolution, with errors comparable to the numerical Trotterization error. Finally, we consider noise models in quantum circuit simulations to account for gate implementation errors in NISQ computers and observe that the noisy simulation closely resembles the noiseless one when gate and idle errors are on the order of $O(10^{-3})$ or smaller.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ground State Properties: Constant Sample Complexity and Deep Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics is that of finding ground states of local Hamiltonians. A number of recent works gave provably efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms for learning ground states. Specifically, [Huang et al. Science 2022], introduced an approach for learning properties of the ground state of an $n$-qubit gapped local Hamiltonian $H$ from only $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ data points sampled from Hamiltonians in the same phase of matter. This was subsequently improved by [Lewis et al. Nature Communications 2024], to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ samples when the geometry of the $n$-qubit system is known. In this work, we introduce two approaches that achieve a constant sample complexity, independent of system size $n$, for learning ground state properties. Our first algorithm consists of a simple modification of the ML model used by Lewis et al. and applies to a property of interest known beforehand. Our second algorithm, which applies even if a description of the property is not known, is a deep neural network model. While empirical results showing the performance of neural networks have been demonstrated, to our knowledge, this is the first rigorous sample complexity bound on a neural network model for predicting ground state properties. We also perform numerical experiments that confirm the improved scaling of our approach compared to earlier results.</description>

Abstract: We present a new simulation-secure quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) protocol based on one-way functions in the plain model. With a focus on practical implementation, our protocol surpasses prior works in efficiency, promising feasible experimental realization. We address potential experimental errors and their correction, offering analytical expressions to facilitate the analysis of the required quantum resources. Technically, we achieve simulation security for QOT through an equivocal and relaxed-extractable quantum bit commitment.</description>

Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

Abstract: Fluxonium qubit is a promising building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time and strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60 ns direct CNOT-gate on two inductively-coupled fluxonium qubits using selective darkening approach, resulting in a gate fidelity as high as 99.94%. The fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between randomized benchmarking measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60 ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the non-decoherence-related errors during gate operations down to $2 \times 10^{-4}$. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of "the beyond three nines" demonstrations on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone.</description>

Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. {As a demonstration, we apply the deep unfolded LQA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, which is a fundamental {model} in statistical physics.} Our findings exhibit that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Usual scenarios of fault-tolerant computation are concerned with the fault-tolerant realization of quantum algorithms that compute classical functions, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring. In particular, this means that input and output to the quantum algorithm are classical. In contrast to stand-alone single-core quantum computers, in many distributed scenarios, quantum information might have to be passed on from one quantum information processing system to another one, possibly via noisy quantum communication channels with noise levels above fault-tolerant thresholds. In such situations, quantum information processing devices will have quantum inputs, quantum outputs or even both, which pass qubits among each other.
  Working in the fault-tolerant framework of [Kitaev, 1997], we show that any quantum circuit with quantum input and output can be transformed into a fault-tolerant circuit that produces the ideal circuit with some controlled noise applied at the input and output. The framework allows the direct composition of the statements, enabling versatile future applications. We illustrate this with two concrete applications. The first one concerns communication over a noisy channel with faulty encoding and decoding operations [Christandl and M{\"u}ller-Hermes, 2024]. For communication codes with linear minimum distance, we construct fault-tolerant encoders and decoders for general noise (including coherent errors). For the weaker, but standard, model of local stochastic noise, we obtain fault-tolerant encoders and decoders for any communication code that can correct a constant fraction random errors. In the second application, we use our result for a state preparation circuit within the construction of [Gottesman, 2014] to establish that fault-tolerant quantum computation for general noise can be achieved with constant space overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian unsteerable channels and computable quantifications of Gaussian steering</title>

Abstract: The current quantum resource theory for Gaussian steering for continuous-variable systems is flawed and incomplete. Its primary shortcoming stems from an inadequate comprehension of the architecture of Gaussian channels transforming Gaussian unsteerable states into Gaussian unsteerable states, resulting in a restricted selection of free operations. In the present paper, we explore in depth the structure of such $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian channels, and introduce the class of the Gaussian unsteerable channels and the class of maximal Gaussian unsteerable channels, both of them may be chosen as the free operations, which completes the resource theory for Gaussian steering from $A$ to $B$ by Alice's Gaussian measurements. We also propose two quantifications $\mathcal{J}_{j}$ $(j=1,2)$ of $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian steering from $A$ to $B$. The computation of the value of $\mathcal{J}_{j}$ is straightforward and efficient, as it solely relies on the covariance matrices of Gaussian states, eliminating the need for any optimization procedures. Though $\mathcal{J}_{j}$s are not genuine Gaussian steering measures, they have some nice properties such as non-increasing under certain Gaussian unsteerable channels. Additionally, we compare ${\mathcal J}_2$ with the Gaussian steering measure $\mathcal N_3$, which is based on the Uhlmann fidelity, revealing that ${\mathcal J}_2$ is an upper bound of $\mathcal N_3$ at certain class of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian pure states. As an illustration, we apply $\mathcal J_2$ to discuss the behaviour of Gaussian steering for a special class of $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states in Markovian environments, which uncovers the intriguing phenomenon of rapid decay in quantum steering.</description>

      <title>The Cram\'{e}r-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cram\'er Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cram\'er-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cram\'er-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cram\'er-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>The Separability Problem in Quantum Mechanics: Insights from Research on Axiomatics and Human Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's article on the EPR paradox is the most cited of his works, but not many know that it was not fully representative of the way he thought about the incompleteness of the quantum formalism. Indeed, his main worry was not Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which he accepted, but the experimental non-separability of spatially separate systems. The same problem was also recognized, years later, by one of us, as part of an axiomatic analysis of the quantum formalism, which revealed an unexpected structural limitation of the quantum formalism in Hilbert space, preventing the description of separate systems. As we will explain, this limitation does not manifest at the level of the states, but of the projectors describing the properties, in the sense that there are not enough properties in the formalism to describe separate systems. The question remains whether separability is a possibility at the fundamental level and if a formalism should integrate it into its mathematical structure, as a possibility. To aid our intuition, we offer a reflection based on a powerful analogy between physical systems and human conceptual entities, as the question of separability also arises for the latter.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of quantum trajectories in dissipative Landau-Zener model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present statistics of quantum jumps in the two-level system with landau-Zener Hamiltonian that undergoes a Markovian process. For the Landau-Zener model, which is successful in simulating adiabatic/non-adiabatic evolution and quantum annealing, we consider two types of dissipation. In the first one, the jump operators project states to the initial ground state and excited state of the Hamiltonian at $t\to -\infty$. In the second type, the jump operators project to the instantaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. By the quantum trajectories approach, we present the probability of the number of jumps in adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes for both models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the statistics of jumps in time intervals of the evolutions. Also, we show the role of bath temperature, coupling strength to the environment, and spin-coupling directions on the statistics of quantum jumps.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove a necessary set of conditions which must be satisfied by any controlled gate in the qubit Clifford Hierarchy. These conditions are straightforward to derive yet quite restricting. We also extend our proofs to gates composed of certain direct sums of unitaries.

Abstract: We implement a simulation environment on top of NetSquid that is specifically designed for estimating the end-to-end fidelity across a path of quantum repeaters or quantum switches. The switch model includes several generalizations which are not currently available in other tools, and are useful for gaining insight into practical and realistic quantum network engineering problems: an arbitrary number of memory registers at the switches, simplicity in including entanglement distillation mechanisms, arbitrary switching topologies, and more accurate models for the depolarization noise. An illustrative case study is presented, namely a comparison in terms of performance between a repeater chain where repeaters can only swap sequentially, and a single switch equipped with multiple memory registers, able to handle multiple swapping requests.</description>

Abstract: We examine the applicability of the numerically accurate method of time dependent variation with multiple Davydov Ansatze (mDA) to non-Hermitian systems. Three systems of interest includes: a non-Hermitian system of dissipative Landau-Zener transitions, a non-Hermitian, multimode Jaynes-Cummings model, and a dissipative Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model, where complex many-body dynamics are accurately captured by the mDA method. Our findings highlight the versatility of the mDA as a powerful numerical tool for investigating complex many-body non-Hermitian systems, which can be extended to explore diverse phenomena such as skin effects, excited-state dynamics, and spectral topology in the non-Hermitian field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and systematic numerical methods for robust control design are crucial in quantum systems due to inevitable uncertainties or disturbances. We propose a novel approach that models uncertainties as random variables and quantifies robustness using the expectation of infidelity. By reformulating the robustness measure as a weighted tensor product quadrature, we employ the Smolyak sparse grid algorithm to develop a parametric robust quantum control scheme. This scheme significantly reduces computational cost while improving accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Smolyak algorithm assisted gradient-based methods including smGOAT and smGRAPE in robust control problems regarding state transfer and quantum gate realization, with ultrahigh fidelity and strong robustness achieved. Our results contribute to improving the reliability and security of quantum computing and communication systems in the presence of real-world imperfections.</description>

      <title>A new general quantum state verification protocol by the classical shadow method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of verifying if a quantum device produces a specific state is ubiquitous in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, we need to design an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state elaborately. In a recent paper arXiv:2404.07281v1, Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. propose a new distinct protocol utilizing the classical shadow, called the shadow overlap protocol, which has the potential for efficiently verifying many types of state in one time. In this paper, we reformulate this new protocol by the terminologies of hypothesis testing, on which the conventional framework is also based, to explore the similarities and differences between them. Then, we propose a new protocol which combines the ideas of the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. Our protocol strengthens the ability of the shadow overlap protocol and overcomes some shortages of the latter, like having a better sample complexity and dealing with the states with special structures more naturally. Finally, we apply our new protocol to the GHZ state and the stabilizer state to illustrate its capacities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much cryptographically-secure randomness can be extracted from a quantum state? This fundamental question probes the absolute limits of quantum random number generation (QRNG) and yet, despite the technological maturity of QRNGs, it remains unsolved. In this work we consider a general adversarial model that allows for an adversary who has quantum side-information about both the source and the measurement device. Using links between randomness extraction rates and sandwiched R\'enyi entropies, we provide compact, easy to compute, achievable rates of secure randomness extraction from quantum states. In turn, this provides a simple to evaluate benchmarking tool for the randomness generation rates of QRNG protocols.</description>

Abstract: Most tests of the validity of local realistic hidden-variable theories with respect to quantum mechanics, are based on inequalities such as Bell's inequality and Clauser Horne, Shimony, and Holt's inequality. In this work we present a simple alternative test which does not involve inequalities, but a direct comparison between correlation functions given by quantum mechanics and local realistic hidden-variable theories. Our test is based on a physically motivated use of Fourier series for periodic functions, and confirms that local realistic hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability Geometrically Realized in Projective Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principal goal of this paper is to pass all quantum probability formulas to the projective space associated to the complex Hilbert space of a given quantum system, providing a more complete geometrization of quantum theory. Quantum events have consecutive and conditional probabilities, which have been used in the author's previous work to clarify 'collapse' and to generalize the concept of entanglement by incorporating it into quantum probability theory. In this way all of standard textbook quantum theory can be understood as a geometric theory of projective subspaces without any special role for the zero-dimensional projective subspaces, which are also called pure states. The upshot is that quantum theory is the probability theory of projective subspaces, or equivalently, of quantum events. For the sake of simplicity the ideas are developed here in the context of a type I factor, but comments will be given about how to adopt this approach to more general von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating energy expectation values of lattice Hamiltonians on quantum computers is a serious challenge, where established techniques can require excessive sample numbers. Here we introduce geometric partitioning as a scalable alternative. It splits the Hamiltonian into subsystems that extend over multiple lattice sites, for which transformations between their local eigenbasis and the computational basis can be efficiently found. This allows us to reduce the number of measurements as we sample from a more concentrated distribution without diagonalizing the problem. For systems in an energy eigenstate, we prove a lower bound on the sampling number improvement over the "naive" mutually commuting local operator grouping, which grows with the considered subsystem size, consistently showing an advantage for our geometric partitioning strategy. Notably, our lower bounds do not decrease but increase for more correlated states (Theorem 1). For states that are weakly isotropically perturbed around an eigenstate, we show how the sampling number improvement translates to imperfect eigenstate improvements, namely measuring close to the true eigenbasis already for smaller perturbations (Theorem 2). We illustrate our findings on multiple two-dimensional lattice models incl. the transverse field XY- and Ising model as well as the Fermi Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Automorphism-Assisted Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for efficient graph optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we report on the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the unweighted MaxCut problem on tree-structured graphs. Specifically, we utilize the Nauty (No Automorphisms, Yes?) package to identify graph automorphisms, focusing on determining edge equivalence classes. These equivalence classes also correspond to symmetries in the terms of the associated Ising Hamiltonian. By exploiting these symmetries, we achieve a significant reduction in the complexity of the Hamiltonian, thereby facilitating more efficient quantum simulations. We conduct benchmark experiments on graphs with up to 34 nodes on memory and CPU intensive TPU provided by google Colab, applying QAOA with a single layer ($p=1$). The approximation ratios obtained from both the full and symmetry-reduced Hamiltonians are systematically compared. Our results show that using automorphism-based symmetries to reduce the Pauli terms in the Hamiltonian can significantly decrease computational overhead without compromising the quality of the solutions obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body ground state preparation is an important subroutine used in the simulation of physical systems. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and efficient framework for obtaining a state preparation circuit for a large class of many-body ground states. We introduce polynomial-time classical algorithms that take reduced density matrices over $\mathcal{O}(1)$-sized balls as inputs, and output a circuit that prepares the global state. We introduce algorithms applicable to (i) short-range entangled states (e.g., states prepared by shallow quantum circuits in any number of dimensions, and more generally, invertible states) and (ii) long-range entangled ground states (e.g., the toric code on a disk). Both algorithms can provably find a circuit whose depth is asymptotically optimal. Our approach uses a variant of the quantum Markov chain condition that remains robust against constant-depth circuits. The robustness of this condition makes our method applicable to a large class of states, whilst ensuring a classically tractable optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>Optimality Condition for the Transpose Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum error correction, the Petz transpose channel serves as a perfect recovery map when the Knill-Laflamme conditions are satisfied. Notably, while perfect recovery is generally infeasible for most quantum channels of finite dimension, the transpose channel remains a versatile tool with near-optimal performance in recovering quantum states. This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the strict optimality of the transpose channel in terms of channel fidelity. The violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.</description>

      <title>From broadband biphotons to frequency combs via spectral compression with time-varying cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biphoton frequency combs are promising resources for quantum networking due in large part to their compatibility with the telecommunication infrastructure. In this work, we propose a method to periodically compress broadband frequency-entangled photons into biphoton frequency combs by utilizing time-varying linear cavities. Our approach hinges on rapid modulation of the input cavity coupling, yielding high spectral purity in each output comb line similar to that achieved with narrowband filters, but without the associated loss in flux. We examine the dependence of spectral purity and compression on coupling strength, cavity loss, and switching speed, finding realistic regimes supporting purities in excess of 0.999 and peak enhancement factors of 100 and beyond.</description>

      <title>A dualization approach to the Ground State Subspace Classification of Abelian Higher Gauge Symmetry Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature, abelian higher gauge symmetry models are shown to be valid in all finite dimensions and exhibit the characteristic behavior of SPT phases models. While the ground state degeneracy and the entanglement entropy were thoroughly studied, the classification of the ground state space still remained obscure. Based on differentio-geometric approach and, anticipating the notation of the current paper, if $\left( C_{\bullet} , \partial^C_{\bullet} \right)$ is the chain complex associated to the geometrical content of these models, while $\left( G_{\bullet} , \partial^G_{\bullet} \right)$ is its symmetries counterpart, we show that the ground state space is classified by a $H^0 (C,G) \times H_0 (C,G)$ group, where $H^0(C,G)$ is the $0$-th cohomology and $H_0 (C,G)$ is the corresponding $0$-th homology group with coefficients in the chain complex.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal eigenstates and slow relaxation in quantum Fredkin spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and thermalization of the Fredkin spin chain, a system with local three-body interactions, particle conservation and explicit kinetic constraints. We consider deformations away from its stochastic point in order to tune between regimes where kinetic energy dominates and those where potential energy does. By means of exact diagonalisation, perturbation theory and variational matrix product states, we show there is a sudden change of behaviour in the dynamics that occurs, from one of fast thermalization to one of slow metastable (prethermal) dynamics near the stochastic point. This change in relaxation is connected to the emergence of additional kinetic constraints which lead to the fragmentation of Hilbert space in the limit of a large potential energy. We also show that this change can lead to thermalization being evaded for special initial conditions due to non-thermal eigenstates (akin to quantum many-body scars). We provide clear evidence for the existence of these non-thermal states for large system sizes even when far from the large-potential-energy limit, and explain their connection to the emergent kinetic constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent oscillations are a hallmark of non-ergodic time evolution. While time-crystalline behavior results from, e.g., many-body localization, here we show that ever-revolving solitary waves emerge in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems. The phenomenon is rather general for a variety of frustrated spin systems in one, two, and three dimensions as well as for Hubbard systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool to study two-dimensional strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we extend the iPEPS toolbox by a method to efficiently evaluate non-equal time two-point correlators, enabling the computation of spectral functions. It is based on an iPEPS ansatz of the ground state in a large unit cell, with an operator applied in the center of the cell, which is evolved in real-time using the fast-full update method. At every time step, the two-point correlators within a cell are computed based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. Benchmark results for the 2D transverse field Ising model show that the main features of the dynamical structure factor can already be reproduced at relatively small bond dimensions and unit cell sizes. The results for the magnon dispersion are found to be in good agreement with previous data obtained with the iPEPS excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Compilation for Dynamically Field-Programmable Qubit Arrays with Efficient and Provably Near-Optimal Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays based on neutral atoms feature high fidelity and highly parallel gates for quantum computing. However, it is challenging for compilers to fully leverage the novel flexibility offered by such hardware while respecting its various constraints. In this study, we break down the compilation for this architecture into three tasks: scheduling, placement, and routing. We formulate these three problems and present efficient solutions to them. Notably, our scheduling based on graph edge-coloring is provably near-optimal in terms of the number of two-qubit gate stages (at most one more than the optimum). As a result, our compiler, Enola, reduces this number of stages by 3.7x and improves the fidelity by 5.9x compared to OLSQ-DPQA, the current state of the art. Additionally, Enola is highly scalable, e.g., within 30 minutes, it can compile circuits with 10,000 qubits, a scale sufficient for the current era of quantum computing. Enola is open source at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/Enola</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum entanglement in visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent development in purely perception based models of collective motion using perception vectors, we suggest a quantum-inspired model of collective behaviour. We investigate the alignment of self-propelled agents by introducing quantum entanglement in the perceptual states of neighboring agents within each agent's vision cone. In this framework, we propose that the force acting on active agents is proportional to the quantum expectation value of perception operator encoding perceptual dynamics that drives alignment within the flock. Additionally, we introduce two quantum mechanical measures-perception strength and perceptual energy-to characterize collective behavior. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of the entangled state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into swarm intelligence and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from entangled perceptual states.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>
