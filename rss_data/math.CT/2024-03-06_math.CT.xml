      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

      <title>Directed degeneracy maps for precubical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric transverse sets were introduced to make the construction of the parallel product with synchronization for process algebras functorial. It is proved that one can do directed homotopy on symmetric transverse sets in the following sense. A q-realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using a q-cofibrant replacement functor of flows. By topologizing the cotransverse maps, the cotransverse topological cube is constructed. It can be regarded both as a cotransverse topological space and as a cotransverse Lawvere metric space. A natural realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path extended to symmetric transverse sets thanks to their structure of Lawvere metric space. It is proved that these two realization functors are homotopy equivalent on cofibrant symmetric transverse sets by using the fact that the small category defining symmetric transverse sets is c-Reedy in Shulman's sense. This generalizes to symmetric transverse sets results previously obtained for precubical sets.</description>

      <title>Notions of enriched purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the enriched notions of purity depending on the left class $\mathcal E$ of a factorization system on the base $\mathcal V$ of enrichment. The ordinary purity is given by the class of surjective mappings in the category of sets. Under specific assumptions, covering enrichment over quantale-valued metric spaces, $\omega$-complete posets, and quasivarieties, we characterize the $(\lambda,\mathcal E)$-injectivity classes of locally presentable $\mathcal V$-categories in terms of closure under a class of limits, $\lambda$-filtered colimits, and $(\lambda,\mathcal E)$-pure subobjects.</description>

      <title>Classification of modular data of integral modular fusion categories up to rank 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a classification of all integral modular fusion categories' modular data and, more broadly, all integral half-Frobenius fusion rings, up to rank 12. We get that each perfect integral modular fusion category, as well as every perfect integral half-Frobenius fusion ring, up to rank 12, is trivial. Furthermore, we establish that every integral modular fusion category of rank 13 is pointed, up to 2 types in progress. We have also refined the categorifiable non-pointed odd-dimensional modular data at ranks below 25 to three possible items, all of rank 17, FPdim 225, and type [[1,3],[3,8],[5,6]], filling literature potential gaps. For rank 25, we have narrowed down the perfect case to 21 types.
  Our initial key insight is that the Egyptian fractions, which are typically employed to list possible types, can be chosen with squared denominators. We then develop several type criteria as initial filters. Particularly, we establish that the number of distinct basic FPdims in a non-trivial perfect fusion ring must be at least 4. To obtain the fusion rings, we solve the dimension and associativity equations using an updated version of Normaliz designed specifically for this purpose. The S-matrices (if they exist) are obtained by self-transposing the character table, while the T-matrices are derived by solving the Anderson-Moore-Vafa equations. Finally, we verify the extended axioms of modular data.</description>

      <title>Single-set cubical categories and their formalisation with a proof assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a single-set axiomatisation of cubical $\omega$-categories, including connections and inverses. We justify these axioms by establishing a series of equivalences between the category of single-set cubical $\omega$-categories, and their variants with connections and inverses, and the corresponding cubical $\omega$-categories. We also report on the formalisation of cubical $\omega$-categories with the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, which has been instrumental in finding the single-set axioms.</description>
