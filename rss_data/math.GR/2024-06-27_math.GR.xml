      <title>Ordered bases, order-preserving automorphisms and bi-orderable link groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new criterion which guarantees that a free group admits a bi-ordering that is invariant under a given automorphism. As an application, we show that the fundamental group of the "magic manifold" is bi-orderable, answering a question of Kin and Rolfsen.</description>

      <title>Short presentations for transformation monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the theorems of Cayley and Vagner-Preston, the full transformation monoids and the symmetric inverse monoids play analogous roles in the theory of monoids and inverse monoids, as the symmetric group does in the theory of groups. Every presentation for the finite full transformation monoids $T_n$, symmetric inverse monoids $I_n$, and partial transformation monoids $PT_n$ contains a monoid presentation for the symmetric group. In this paper we show that the number of relations required, in addition to those for the symmetric group, for each of these monoids are at least $4$, $3$, and $8$, respectively. We also give presentations for: $T_n$ with $4$ additional relations when $n$ is odd and $n\geq 5$; and $5$ additional relations for all $n\geq 4$; for $I_n$ with $3$ additional relations for all $n \geq 3$; and for $PT_n$ with $9$ relations for all $n\geq 4$. The presentations for $T_n$ and $I_n$ answer open problems in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebra $\Sigma_n$ induced by the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on $V^{\otimes n}$ when $\dim V=2$. Our main result is that the space of symmetric elements of $\Sigma_n$ is linearly spanned by the involutions of $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Finite-State Machines for Horospheres in Hyperbolic Right-Angled Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relatively little is known about the discrete horospheres in hyperbolic groups, even in simple settings. In this paper we work with hyperbolic one-ended right-angled Coxeter groups and describe two graph structures that mimic the intrinsic metric on a classical horosphere: the Rips graph and the divergence graph (the latter due to Cohen, Goodman-Strauss, and Rieck). We develop, analyze, and implement algorithms based on finite-state machines that draw large finite portions of these graphs, and deduce various geometric corollaries about the path metrics induced by these graph structures.</description>

      <title>One-relator hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that one-relator groups with negative immersions are hyperbolic and virtually special; this resolves a recent conjecture of Louder and Wilton. As a consequence, one-relator groups with negative immersions are residually finite, linear and have isomorphism problem decidable among one-relator groups. Using the fact that parafree one-relator groups have negative immersions, we answer a question of Baumslag's from 1986. The main new tool we develop is a refinement of the classic Magnus--Moldavanskii hierarchy for one-relator groups. We introduce the notions of Z-stable HNN-extensions and Z-stable hierarchies. We then show that a one-relator group is hyperbolic and has a quasi-convex one-relator hierarchy if and only if it does not contain a Baumslag--Solitar subgroup and has a Z-stable one-relator hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Normalizers of Sylow subgroups in finite reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite reflection group, either real or complex, and $S_\ell$ a Sylow $\ell$-subgroup of $W$. We prove the existence of a semidirect product decomposition of $N_W(S_\ell)$ in terms of the unique parabolic subgroup of $W$ minimally containing $S_\ell$ and known decompositions of normalizers of parabolic subgroups. In the real setting, the description follows from the existence of Sylow $\ell$-subgroups stable under the Coxeter diagram automorphisms of finite reflection groups with no proper parabolic subgroup containing a Sylow $\ell$-subgroup.</description>

      <title>Virtually free-by-cyclic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a homological characterisation of virtually free-by-cyclic groups among groups that are hyperbolic and virtually compact special. As a consequence, we show that many groups known to be coherent actually possess the stronger property of being virtually free-by-cyclic. In particular, we show that all one-relator groups with torsion are virtually free-by-cyclic, solving a conjecture of Baumslag.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ converges strongly to a family $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ in a $C^*$-algebra if $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x})\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a central role in several recent breakthrough results on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, strong convergence is notoriously difficult to prove and has generally required delicate problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a sharp understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We study spaces $X$ for which the space $Hom_p(X)$ of automorphisms with the topology of point-wise convergence is a topological group. We identify large classes of spaces $X$ for which $Hom_p(X)$ is or is not a topological group.</description>
