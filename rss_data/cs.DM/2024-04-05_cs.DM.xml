      <title>Faster and shorter synthesis of Hamiltonian simulation circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise greedy heuristics tailored for synthesizing quantum circuits that implement a specified set of Pauli rotations. Our heuristics are designed to minimize either the count of entangling gates or the depth of entangling gates, and they can be adjusted to either maintain or loosen the ordering of rotations. We present benchmark results demonstrating a depth reduction of up to a factor of 4 compared to the current state-of-the-art heuristics for synthesizing Hamiltonian simulation circuits. We also show that these heuristics can be used to optimize generic quantum circuits by decomposing and resynthesizing them.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and factorisation of transients in Functional Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08310v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional graphs (FGs) model the graph structures used to analyse the behaviour of functions from a discrete set to itself. In turn, such functions are used to study real complex phenomena evolving in time. As the systems involved can be quite large, it is interesting to decompose and factorise them into several subgraphs acting together. Polynomial equations over functional graphs provide a formal way to represent this decomposition and factorisation mechanism, and solving them validates or invalidates hypotheses on their decomposability. The current solution method breaks down a single equation into a series of basic equations of the form AxX = B (with A, X, and B being FGs) to identify the possible solutions. However, it is able to consider just FGs made of cycles only. This work proposes an algorithm for solving these basic equations for general connected FGs. By exploiting a connection with the cancellation problem, we prove that the upper bound to the number of solutions is closely related to the size of the cycle in the coefficient A of the equation. The cancellation problem is also involved in the main algorithms provided by the paper. We introduce a polynomial-time semi-decision algorithm able to provide constraints that a potential solution will have to satisfy if it exists. Then, exploiting the ideas introduced in the first algorithm, we introduce a second exponential-time algorithm capable of finding all solutions by integrating several 'hacks' that try to keep the exponential as tight as possible.</description>

      <title>Connected Dominating Sets in Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex triangulation has a connected dominating set of size at most $10n/21$. Equivalently, every $n$ vertex triangulation has a spanning tree with at least $11n/21$ leaves. Prior to the current work, the best known bounds were $n/2$, which follows from work of Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson, and Thomassen (J. Graph Theory \textbf{14}(2):247--258). One immediate consequence of this result is an improved bound for the SEFENOMAP graph drawing problem of Angelini, Evans, Frati, and Gudmundsson (J. Graph Theory \textbf{82}(1):45--64). As a second application, we show that for every set $P$ of $\lceil 11n/21\rceil$ points in $\R^2$ every $n$-vertex planar graph has a one-bend non-crossing drawing in which some set of $11n/21$ vertices is drawn on the points of $P$. The main result extends to $n$-vertex triangulations of genus-$g$ surfaces, and implies that these have connected dominating sets of size at most $10n/21+O(\sqrt{gn})$.</description>
