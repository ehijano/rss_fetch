      <title>On the minimum number of eigenvalues of trees of diameter seven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying graph $G$ of a symmetric matrix $M=(m_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the graph with vertex set $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ such that a pair $\{v_i,v_j\}$ with $i\neq j$ is an edge if and only if $m_{ij}\neq 0$. Given a graph $G$, let $q(G)$ be the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues in a symmetric matrix whose underlying graph is $G$. A symmetric matrix $M$ is said to be a realization of $q(G)$ if it has underlying graph $G$ and $q(G)$ distinct eigenvalues. In the case of trees, a paper by Johnson and Saiago [Johnson, C.R, and Saiago, C.M, Diameter Minimal Trees, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 64(3) (2015), 557--571.] proposed an approach by which realizations of large trees are constructed from realizations of smaller trees with the same diameter, known as seeds, which has proved to be very successful. In this paper, we discuss realizations of $q(T)$ for trees of diameter seven based on the seed that defines it, correcting a result in the aforementioned paper.</description>

      <title>The Saturation Spectrum of Berge Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forbidden subgraph problem is among the oldest in extremal combinatorics -- how many edges can an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph have? The answer to this question is the well-studied extremal number of $F$. Observing that every extremal example must be maximally $F$-free, a natural minimization problem is also studied -- how few edges can an $n$-vertex maximal $F$-free graph have? This leads to the saturation number of $F$. Both of these problems are notoriously difficult to extend to $k$-uniform hypergraphs for any $k\ge 3$.
  Barefoot et al., in the case of forbidding triangles in graphs, asked a beautiful question -- which numbers of edges, between the saturation number and the extremal number, are actually realized by an $n$-vertex maximal $F$-free graph? Hence named the saturation spectrum of $F$, this has since been determined precisely for several classes of graphs through a large number of papers over the past two decades.
  In this paper, we extend the notion of the saturation spectrum to the hypergraph context. Given a graph $F$ and a hypergraph $G$ embedded on the same vertex set, we say $G$ is a {\bf{Berge-$F$}} if there exists a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to E(G)$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for all $e\in E(F)$. We completely determine the saturation spectrum for $3$-uniform Berge-$K_{1,\ell}$ for $1\leq \ell\leq 4$, and for $\ell=5$ when $5\mid n$. We also determine all but a constant number of values in the spectrum for $3$-uniform Berge-$K_{1,\ell}$ for all $\ell\geq 5$. We note that this is the first result determining the saturation spectrum for any non-trivial hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Domination and Multistate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domination theory has been studied extensively in the context of binary monotone systems, where the structure function is a sum of products of the component state variables, and with coefficients given by the signed domination function. Using e.g., matroid theory, many useful properties of the signed domination function has been derived. In this paper we show how some of these results can be extended to multistate systems. In particular, we show how the signed domination function can be extended to such systems. Using M\"{o}bius inversion we show how the signed domination function can be expressed in terms of a multistate structure function. Moreover, using this expression we show how calculating the signed domination function of a multistate system can be reduced to calculating the signed domination function of an associated binary system. This way many results from binary theory can easily be extended to multistate theory.</description>

      <title>On Clique Graphs and Clique Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\Gamma$ is a graph for which every edge is in exactly one clique of order $\omega$, then one can form a new graph with vertex set equal to these cliques. This is a generalization of the line graph of $\Gamma$. We discover many general results and classifications related to these clique graph that will be useful to researchers studying these objects. In particular, we find bounds on its eigenvalues (with exact results when $\Gamma$ is $k$-regular) and some complete classifications when $\Gamma$ is strongly regular. We apply our results to many examples, including Conway's 99-graph problem and the existence problem for other strongly regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Merge-width and First-Order Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce merge-width, a family of graph parameters that unifies several structural graph measures, including treewidth, degeneracy, twin-width, clique-width, and generalized coloring numbers. Our parameters are based on new decompositions called construction sequences. These are sequences of ever coarser partitions of the vertex set, where each pair of parts has a specified default connection, and all vertex pairs of the graph that differ from the default are marked as resolved. The radius-$r$ merge-width is the maximum number of parts reached from a vertex by following a path of at most $r$ resolved edges. Graph classes of bounded merge-width -- for which the radius-$r$ merge-width parameter can be bounded by a constant, for each fixed $r=1,2,3,\ldots$ -- include all classes of bounded expansion or of bounded twin-width, thus unifying two central notions from the Sparsity and Twin-width frameworks. Furthermore, they are preserved under first-order transductions, which attests to their robustness. We conjecture that classes of bounded merge-width are equivalent to the previously introduced classes of bounded flip-width.
  As our main result, we show that the model checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on graph classes of bounded merge-width, assuming the input includes a witnessing construction sequence. This unites and extends two previous model checking results: the result of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k, Kr\'{a}l, and Thomas for classes of bounded expansion, and the result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant for classes of bounded twin-width.
  Finally, we suggest future research directions that could impact the study of structural and algorithmic graph theory, in particular of monadically dependent graph classes, which we conjecture to coincide with classes of almost bounded merge-width.</description>

      <title>Variable degeneracy of planar graphs without chorded 6-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cover of a graph $G$ is a graph $H$ with vertex set $V(H) = \bigcup_{v \in V(G)} L_{v}$, where $L_{v} = \{v\} \times [s]$, and the edge set $M = \bigcup_{uv \in E(G)} M_{uv}$, where $M_{uv}$ is a matching between $L_{u}$ and $L_{v}$. A vertex set $T \subseteq V(H)$ is a transversal of $H$ if $|T \cap L_{v}| = 1$ for each $v \in V(G)$. Let $f$ be a nonnegative integer valued function on the vertex-set of $H$. If for any nonempty subgraph $\Gamma$ of $H[T]$, there exists a vertex $x \in V(H)$ such that $d(x) &lt; f(x)$, then $T$ is called a strictly $f$-degenerate transversal. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of strictly $f$-degenerate transversal for planar graphs without chorded $6$-cycles. As a consequence, every planar graph without subgraphs isomorphic to the configurations in Fig. 4 is DP-$4$-colorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak degeneracy of a graph is a variation of degeneracy that has a close relationship to many graph coloring parameters. In this article, we prove that planar graphs with distance of $3$-cycles at least 2 and no cycles of lengths $5, 6, 7$ are weakly $2$-degenerate. Furthermore, such graphs can be vertex-partitioned into two subgraphs, one of which has no edges, and the other is a forest.</description>

      <title>Realizing degree sequences with $\mathcal S_3$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $\mathcal S_3$-connected if, for any mapping $\beta : V (G) \mapsto {\mathbb Z}_3$ with $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \beta(v)\equiv 0\pmod3$, there exists a strongly connected orientation $D$ satisfying $d^{+}_D(v)-d^{-}_D(v)\equiv \beta(v)\pmod{3}$ for any $v \in V(G)$. It is known that $\mathcal S_3$-connected graphs are contractible configurations for the property of flow index strictly less than three. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of graphic sequences that have an $\mathcal{S}_{3}$-connected realization: A graphic sequence $\pi=(d_1,\, \ldots,\, d_n )$ has an $\mathcal S_3$-connected realization if and only if $\min \{d_1,\, \ldots,\, d_n\} \ge 4$ and $\sum^n_{i=1}d_i \ge 6n - 4$. Consequently, every graphic sequence $\pi=(d_1,\, \ldots,\, d_n )$ with $\min \{d_1,\, \ldots,\, d_n\} \ge 6$ has a realization $G$ with flow index strictly less than three. This supports a conjecture of Li, Thomassen, Wu and Zhang [European J. Combin., 70 (2018) 164-177] that every $6$-edge-connected graph has flow index strictly less than three.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Cuntz and K\"uhne introduced a particular class of hyperplane arrangements stemming from a given graph $G$, so called connected subgraph arrangements $A_G$. In this note we strengthen some of the result from their work and prove new ones for members of this class. For instance, we show that aspherical members withing this class stem from a rather restricted set of graphs. Specifically, if $A_G$ is an aspherical connected subgraph arrangement, then $A_G$ is free with the unique possible exception when the underlying graph $G$ is the complete graph on $4$ nodes.</description>

      <title>Chevalley operations on TNN Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lusztig showed that invertible totally nonnegative (TNN) matrices form a semigroup generated by positive diagonal matrices and Chevalley generators. From its Grassmann analogue, we introduce Chevalley operations on index sets, which we show have a rich variety of applications. We first completely classify all inequalities that are quadratic in Plucker coordinates over the TNN part of the Grassmannian: \[\sum_{I,J}c_{I,J}\Delta_I\Delta_J\ge 0\quad over\quad \mathrm{Gr}^{\ge 0}(m,m+n)\] where each $c_{I,J}$ is real, and $\Delta_I,\Delta_J$ are Plucker coordinates with a homogeneity condition. Using an idea of Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein, we also explain how our Chevalley operations can be motivated from cluster mutations, and lead to working in Grassmannians of smaller dimension, akin to cluster algebras.
  We then present several applications of Chevalley operations. First, we obtain certificates for the above inequalities via sums of coefficients $c_{I,J}$ over 321-avoiding permutations and involutions; we believe this refined results of Rhoades-Skandera for TNN-matrix inequalities via their Temperley-Lieb immanant idea.
  Second, we provide a novel proof via Chevalley operations of Lam's log-supermodularity of Plucker coordinates. This has several consequences: (a) Each positroid, corresponding to the positroid cells in Postnikov's decomposition of the TNN Grassmannian, is a distributive lattice. (b) It also yields numerical positivity in the main result of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy. (c) We show the coordinatewise monotonicity of ratios of Schur polynomials, first proved by Khare-Tao and which is the key result they use to obtain quantitative estimates for positivity preservers.
  Third, we employ Chevalley operations to show that the majorization order over partitions implicates a partial order for induced character immanants over TNN matrices, proved originally by Skandera-Soskin.</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and Zarankiewicz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices plays an important role in communication complexity and discrepancy theory. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of this norm, and provide new applications, involving Zarankiewicz type problems. We show that if $M$ is an $m\times n$ Boolean matrix such that $\gamma_2(M)&lt;\gamma$ and $M$ contains no $t\times t$ all-ones submatrix, then $M$ contains $O_{\gamma,t}(m+n)$ one entries. In other words, graphs of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm are degree bounded. This addresses a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami for locally sparse matrices. We prove that if $G$ is a $K_{t,t}$-free incidence graph of $n$ points and $n$ homothets of a polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the average degree of $G$ is $O_{d,P}(t(\log n)^{O(d)})$. This is sharp up the $O(.)$ notations. In particular, we prove a more general result on semilinear graphs, which greatly strengthens the work of Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran. We present further results about dimension-free bounds on the discrepancy of matrices based on oblivious data structures, and a simple method to estimate the $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices with no four cycles.</description>

      <title>Amplitubes: Graph Cosmohedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tree-level scattering amplitudes for $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory can be interpreted as a sum over the vertices of a polytope known as the associahedron. For each graph $G$, there exists a natural generalisation of the associahedron, which is constructed by considering tubes and tubings of the underling graph. This family of polytopes are called graph associahedra. The classical associahedra then arise as the graph associahedron for the path graphs. It is therefore natural to associate to each graph associahedron an amplitude-like object, we refer to as the amplitube, defined via a sum over its vertices. Recently, also in the context of trace $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, progress has been made towards defining a new geometric object, coined the cosmohedron, which computes not the amplitude, but the cosmological wavefunction as a sum over its vertices. This polytope can be constructed by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the associahedron to co-dimension one. Building on these results, in the present paper, we generalise the notion of the wavefunction for arbitrary graphs. These new expressions, which we call cosmological amplitubes, are defined via a sum over the vertices of a corresponding polytope, the graph cosmohedron. The graph cosmohedra are constructed by considering regions and regional tubings of the underlying graph which we introduce. Like the cosmohedron, the graph cosmohedra can be obtained by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the corresponding graph associahedron to co-dimension one. This new family of polytopes constitutes a vast generalisation of the cosmohedron, and we provide explicit embeddings for them, which builds upon an ABHY-like embedding for the graph associahedra.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, much attention has been placed on the complexity of graph homomorphism problems when the input is restricted to ${\mathbb P}_k$-free and ${\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free graphs. We consider the directed version of this research line, by addressing the questions, is it true that digraph homomorphism problems CSP$({\mathbb H})$ have a P versus NP-complete dichotomy when the input is restricted to $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-free (resp.\ $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free) digraphs? Our main contribution in this direction shows that if CSP$({\mathbb H})$ is NP-complete, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that CSP$({\mathbb H})$ remains NP-hard even for $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs. Moreover, it remains NP-hard for acyclic $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs, and becomes polynomial-time solvable for $\vec{\mathbb P}_{N-1}$-subgraph-free acyclic digraphs. We then verify the questions above for digraphs on three vertices and a family of smooth tournaments. We prove these results by establishing a connection between $\mathbb F$-(subgraph)-free algorithmics and constraint satisfaction theory. On the way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\mathbb H})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called restricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Another main result of this paper presents a P versus NP-complete dichotomy for these problems. Moreover, this complexity dichotomy is accompanied by an algebraic dichotomy in the spirit of the finite domain CSP dichotomy.</description>

      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a polynomial-time pivot rule for the simplex method is a fundamental open question in optimization. While many super-polynomial lower bounds exist for individual or very restricted classes of pivot rules, there currently is little hope for an unconditional lower bound that addresses all pivot rules. We approach this question by considering the active-set method as a natural generalization of the simplex method to non-linear objectives. This generalization allows us to prove the first unconditional lower bound for all pivot rules. More precisely, we construct a multivariate polynomial of degree linear in the number of dimensions such that the active-set method started in the origin visits all vertices of the hypercube. We hope that our framework serves as a starting point for a new angle of approach to understanding the complexity of the simplex method.</description>

      <title>Connectivity for square percolation and coarse cubical rigidity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random right-angled Coxeter groups, $W_{\Gamma}$, whose presentation graph $\Gamma$ is taken to be an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph, i.e., $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use techniques from probabilistic combinatorics to establish several new results about the geometry of these random groups.
  We resolve a conjecture of Susse and determine the connectivity threshold for square percolation on the random graph $\Gamma \sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use this result to determine a large range of $p$ for which the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ has a unique cubical coarse median structure. Until recent work of Fioravanti, Levcovitz and Sageev, there were no non-hyperbolic examples of groups with cubical coarse rigidity; our present results show the property is in fact typically satisfied by a random RACG for a wide range of the parameter $p$, including $p=1/2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the algebraic matroid induced by the ideal of (r+1)-minors of a matrix of variables over a field. This is inherently connected to the bounded-rank matrix completion problem, in which the aim is to complete a partially observed rank r matrix. We give criteria that detect dependent sets in the matroid, we describe a family of bases of the matroid, and we study the question of unique completability.</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on plane 4-graphs, that is, planar graphs of maximum degree 4 whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size 2. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

      <title>Square-free powers of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ denote the $k^{\text{th}}$ square-free power of the facet ideal of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ in a polynomial ring $R$. Square-free powers are intimately related to the `Matching Theory' and `Ordinary Powers'. In this article, we show that if $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest, then $R/I(\Delta)^{[k]}$ is Cohen-Macaulay for all $k\ge 1$. This result is quite interesting since all ordinary powers of a graded radical ideal can never be Cohen-Macaulay unless it is a complete intersection. To prove the result, we introduce a new combinatorial notion called special leaf, and using this, we provide an explicit combinatorial formula of $\mathrm{depth}(R/I(\Delta)^{[k]})$ for all $k\ge 1$, where $\Delta$ is a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest. As an application, we show that the normalized depth function of a Cohen-Macaulay simplicial forest is nonincreasing.</description>

      <title>Existence of a Non-Zero $(0,1)$-Vector in the Row Space of Adjacency Matrices of Simple Graphs</title>

Abstract: We look for a non-zero $(0, 1)$-vector in the row space of the adjacency matrix $A(\Gamma)$ of a graph $\Gamma,$ provided $\Gamma$ has at least one edge. Akbari, Cameron, and Khosrovshahi conjectured that there exists a non-zero $(0,1)$-vector in the row space of $A(\Gamma)$ (over the real numbers) which does not occur as a row of $A(\Gamma).$ This conjecture can be easily verified for graphs having diameter is equal to $1$ (complete graphs). In this article, we affirmatively prove this conjecture for any graph whose diameter is $\geq 4.$ Furthermore, in the remaining two cases that is, for graphs with diameter is equal to $2$ or $3,$ we report some progress in support of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A random Hall-Paige conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete mapping of a group $G$ is a bijection $\phi\colon G\to G$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is also bijective. Hall and Paige conjectured in 1955 that a finite group $G$ has a complete mapping whenever $\prod_{x\in G} x$ is the identity in the abelianization of $G$. This was confirmed in 2009 by Wilcox, Evans, and Bray with a proof using the classification of finite simple groups. \par In this paper, we give a combinatorial proof of a far-reaching generalisation of the Hall-Paige conjecture for large groups. We show that for random-like and equal-sized subsets $A,B,C$ of a group $G$, there exists a bijection $\phi\colon A\to B$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$ whenever $\prod_{a\in A} a \prod_{b\in B} b=\prod_{c\in C} c$ in the abelianization of $G$. We use this statement as a black-box to settle the following old problems in combinatorial group theory for large groups. (1) We characterise sequenceable groups, that is, groups which admit a permutation $\pi$ of their elements such that the partial products $\pi_1$, $\pi_1\pi_2$, $\pi_1\pi_2\cdots \pi_n$ are all distinct. This resolves a problem of Gordon from 1961 and confirms conjectures made by several authors, including Keedwell's 1981 conjecture that all large non-abelian groups are sequenceable. We also characterise the related $R$-sequenceable groups, addressing a problem of Ringel from 1974. (2) We confirm in a strong form a conjecture of Snevily from 1999 by characterising large subsquares of multiplication tables of finite groups that admit transversals. Previously, this characterisation was known only for abelian groups of odd order (by a combination of papers by Alon and Dasgupta-K\'arolyi-Serra-Szegedy and Arsovski).</description>

      <title>On odd colorings of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An \emph{odd $c$-coloring} of a graph is a proper $c$-coloring such that each non-isolated vertex has a color appearing an odd number of times within its open neighborhood. A \emph{proper conflict-free $c$-coloring} of a graph is a proper $c$-coloring such that each non-isolated vertex has a color appearing exactly once within its neighborhood. Clearly, every proper conflict-free $c$-coloring is also an odd $c$-coloring. Cranston conjectured that every graph $G$ with maximum average degree $\text{mad}(G) &lt; \frac{4c}{c+2}$ (where $c \geq 4$) has an odd $c$-coloring, and he proved this conjecture for $c \in \{5, 6\}$. Note that the bound $\frac{4c}{c+2}$ is best possible. Cho et al. solved Cranston's conjecture for $c \geq 5$, strengthening the result by transitioning from odd $c$-coloring to proper conflict-free $c$-coloring. However, they did not provide all the extremal non-colorable graphs $G$ with $\text{mad}(G) = \frac{4c}{c+2}$, which remains an open question of interest.
  In this paper, we tackle this intriguing extremal problem. We aim to characterize all non-proper conflict-free $c$-colorable graphs $G$ with $\text{mad}(G) = \frac{4c}{c+2}$. For the case of $c=4$, Cranston's conjecture is not true, as evidenced by the existence of a counterexample: a graph whose every block is a $5$-cycle. Cho et al.\ proved that a graph $G$ with $\text{mad}(G) &lt; \frac{22}{9}$ and no induced $5$-cycles has an odd $4$-coloring. We improve this result by proving that a graph $G$ with $\text{mad}(G) \leq \frac{22}{9}$ (with equality allowed) is not odd $4$-colorable if and only if $G$ belongs to a specific class of graphs. On the other hand, Cho et al.\ established that a planar graph with girth at least $5$ has an odd $6$-coloring; we improve it by proving that a planar graph without $4^{-}$-cycles adjacent to $7^{-}$-cycles also has an odd $6$-coloring.</description>

      <title>Numerical semigroups, polyhedra, and posets IV: walking the faces of the Kunz cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a cofinite subset of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ containing $0$ and closed under addition. Each numerical semigroup $S$ with smallest positive element $m$ corresponds to an integer point in the Kunz cone $\mathcal C_m \subseteq \mathbb R^{m-1}$, and the face of $\mathcal C_m$ containing that integer point determines certain algebraic properties of $S$. In this paper, we introduce the Kunz fan, a pure, polyhedral cone complex comprised of a faithful projection of certain faces of $\mathcal C_m$. We characterize several aspects of the Kunz fan in terms of the combinatorics of Kunz nilsemigroups, which are known to index the faces of $\mathcal C_m$, and our results culminate in a method of "walking" the face lattice of the Kunz cone in a manner analogous to that of a Gr\"obner walk. We apply our results in several contexts, including a wealth of computational data obtained from the aforementioned "walks" and a proof of a recent conjecture concerning which numerical semigroups achieve the highest minimal presentation cardinality when one fixes the smallest positive element and the number of generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Vershik proposed a new combinatorial invariant of metric spaces given by a class of polytopes that arise in the theory of optimal transport and are called ``Wasserstein polytopes'' or ``Kantorovich-Rubinstein polytopes'' in the literature. Answering a question posed by Vershik, we describe the stratification of the metric cone induced by the combinatorial type of these polytopes through a hyperplane arrangement. Moreover, we study its relationships with the stratification by combinatorial type of the injective hull (i.e., the tight span) and, in particular, with certain types of metrics arising in phylogenetic analysis. We also compute enumerative invariants in the case of metrics on up to six points.</description>

      <title>Multi-cyclic graphs in the random graph process with restricted budget</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a controlled random graph process introduced by Frieze, Krivelevich, and Michaeli. In this model, the edges of a complete graph are randomly ordered and revealed sequentially to a builder. For each edge revealed, the builder must irrevocably decide whether to purchase it. The process is subject to two constraints: the number of observed edges $t$ and the builder's budget $b$. The goal of the builder is to construct, with high probability, a graph possessing a desired property.
  Previously, the optimal dependencies of the budget $b$ on $n$ and $t$ were established for constructing a graph containing a fixed tree or cycle, and the authors claimed that their proof could be extended to any unicyclic graph. The problem, however, remained open for graphs containing at least two cycles, the smallest of which is the graph $K_4^-$ (a clique of size four with one edge removed).
  In this paper, we provide a strategy to construct a copy of the graph $K_4^-$ if $b \gg \max\left\{n^6 / t^4, n^{4 / 3} / t^{2 / 3}\right\}$, and show that this bound is tight, answering the question posed by Frieze et al. concerning this specific graph. We also give a strategy to construct a copy of a graph consisting of $k$ triangles intersecting at a single vertex (the $k$-fan) if $b \gg \max\left\{n^{4k - 1} / t^{3k - 1}, n / \sqrt{t}\right\}$, and also show that this bound is tight. These are the first optimal strategies for constructing a multi-cyclic graph in this random graph model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The setting of projective systems can be used to study the parameters of a projective linear code $\mathcal{C}$. This can be done by considering the intersections of the point set $\Omega$ defined by the columns of a generating matrix for $\mathcal{C}$ with the hyperplanes of a projective space. In particular, $\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\Omega$ is cutting, i.e., every hyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\Omega$. Minimal linear codes have important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some algebraic hypersurfaces $\mathcal{V}_{\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e&gt;1$ odd. These varieties give rise to a new infinite family of linear codes which are minimal except for $r=3$ and $e\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. In the case $r \in \{3,4\}$, we exhibit codes having at most 6 non-zero weights whose we provide the complete list. As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just $3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also important in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect to subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap in order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not satisfied. Finally, we then apply these notions to Hermitian codes and to the codes related to $\mathcal{V}_\varepsilon^r$ discussed before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey article featuring some of Wolmer Vasconcelos' contributions to commutative algebra, and explaining how Vasconcelos' work and insights have contributed to the development of commutative algebra and its interaction with other areas to the present. We discuss the Vasconcelos' function and the Vasconcelos' number (v-number for short) of graded ideals and their relation to coding theory, and the interplay of Simis and normal monomial ideals with combinatorial optimization problems, blowup algebras, and resurgence theory. The regularity of subrings of normal k-uniform monomial ideals is shown to be a monotone function, and we give a normality criterion for edge ideals of graphs using Ehrhart rings.</description>

      <title>On the action of the Weyl group on canonical bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study representations of simply-laced Weyl groups which are equipped with canonical bases. Our main result is that for a large class of representations, the separable elements of the Weyl group $W$ act on these canonical bases by bijections up to lower-order terms. Examples of this phenomenon include the action of separable permutations on the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis of irreducible representations for the symmetric group, and the action of separable elements of $W$ on dual canonical bases of weight zero in tensor product representations of a Lie algebra. Our methods arise from categorical representation theory, and in particular the study of the perversity of Rickard complexes acting on triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>A Purely Geometric Variant of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale--Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$ to its opposite. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n/3$. Moreover, this can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>
