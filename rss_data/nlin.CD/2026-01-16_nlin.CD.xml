      <title>Probing the Chaos to Integrability Transition in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.</description>

      <title>Global dynamical structures from infinitesimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists and engineers alike target modeling of complex, high dimensional, and nonlinear dynamical systems as a central goal. Machine learning breakthroughs alongside mounting computation and data advance the efficacy of learning from trajectory measurements. However scientifically interpreting data-driven models, e.g., localizing attracting sets and their basins, remains elusive. Such limitations particularly afflict identification of system-level regulatory mechanisms characteristic of living systems, e.g., stabilizing control for whole-body locomotion, where discontinuous, transient, and multiscale phenomena are common and prior models are rare. As a next step towards theory-grounded discovery of behavioral mechanisms in biology and beyond, we introduce VERT, a framework for discovering attracting sets from trajectories without recourse to any global model. Our infinitesimal-local-global (ILG) pipeline estimates the proximity of any sampled state to an attracting set, if one exists, with formal accuracy guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on phenomenological and physical oscillators with hierarchical and impulsive dynamics, finding sensitivity to both global and intermediate attractors composed in sequence and parallel. Application of VERT to human running kinematics data reveals insight into control modules that stabilize task-level dynamics, supporting a longstanding neuromechanical control hypothesis. The VERT framework promotes rigorous inference of underlying dynamical structure even for systems where learning a global dynamics model is impractical or impossible.</description>
