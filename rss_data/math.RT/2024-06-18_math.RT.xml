      <title>Diagrammatics for the smallest quantum coideal and Jones--Wenzl projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe algebraically, diagrammatically and in terms of weight vectors, the restriction of tensor powers of the standard representation of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ to a coideal subalgebra. We realise the category as module category over the monoidal category of type $\pm1$ representations in terms of string diagrams and via generators and relations. The idempotents projecting onto the quantized eigenspaces are described as type $B/D$ analogues of Jones--Wenzl projectors. As an application we introduce and give recursive formulas for analogues of $\Theta$-networks.</description>

      <title>On universal deformation rings of modules over a certain class of symmetric algebras of finite representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{k}$ be an algebraically closed field. Recently, K. Erdmann classified the symmetric $\mathbf{k}$-algebras $\Lambda$ of finite representation type such that every non-projective module $M$ has period dividing four. The goal of this paper is to determine the indecomposable modules $M$ over these class of algebras $\Lambda$ whose stable endomorphism ring is isomorphic to $\mathbf{k}$, and then calculate their corresponding universal deformation rings (in the sense of F. M. Bleher and the third author).</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional modules for linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate infinite dimensional modules for a linear algebraic group $\mathbb G$ over a field of positive characteristic $p$. For any subcoalgebra $C \subset \mathcal O(\mathbb G)$ of the coordinate algebra of $\mathbb G$, we consider the abelian subcategory $CoMod(C) \subset Mod(\mathbb G)$ and the left exact functor $(-)_C: Mod(\mathbb G) \to CoMod(C)$ that is right adjoint to the inclusion functor. The class of cofinite $\mathbb G$-modules is formulated using finite dimensional subcoalgebras of $\mathcal O(\mathbb G)$ and the new invariant of "cofinite type" is introduced.
  We are particularly interested in mock injective $\mathbb G$-modules, $\mathbb G$-modules which are not seen by earlier support theories. Various properties of these ghostly $\mathbb G$-modules are established. The stable category $StMock(\mathbb G)$ is introduced, enabling mock injective $\mathbb G$-modules to fit into the framework of tensor triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of non-uniform permutations and representation theory of the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use representation theory of the symmetric group S_n to prove Poisson limit theorems for the distribution of fixed points for three types of non-uniform permutations. First, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g and x are uniform in S_n. Second, we give results for the commutator of x and g where g is uniform in S_n and x is fixed. Third, we give results for permutations obtained by multiplying n*log(n)/2 + cn random transpositions, as well as a conjecture related to the more general i-cycle walk. Most of our results are known by other, quite different, methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we classify 1-cocycles of the Witt algebra with coefficients in the tensor product of two arbitrary tensor density modules. In a special case, we recover a theorem originally established by Ng and Taft in \cite{NT}. Furthermore, by these 1-cocycles, we determine Lie bialgebra structures over certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras containing the Witt algebra.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Stability theorems for multiplicities in graded $S_n$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several stability theorems for multiplicities of naturally defined representations of symmetric groups. The first such theorem states that if we consider the diagonal action of the symmetric group $S_{m+r}$ on $k$ sets of $m+r$ variables, then the dimension of the invariants of degree $m$ is the same as the dimension of the invariants of degree $m$ for $S_{m}$ acting on $k$ sets of $m$ variables. Building on this stability, the last section looks at the Hilbert series of coinvariants of the polynomial ring in $k$ sets of $m$ variables. We address a conjecture that the Hilbert series, in degrees no more than $m$, can be computed by a truncated power series expression. Using some auxiliary results and manipulations of power series, we show that if this holds for $k$ and $m$, then the truncation gives the correct Hilbert series up to degree $m$ for $k$ sets of $n \geq m$ variables. This shows the validity of the conjecture up to certain degrees. We also provide a new equivalent conjecture regarding Gr\"{o}bner bases.
  The second type of stability result is for Weyl modules. We prove that the dimension of the $S_{m+r}$ invariants for a Weyl module ${}_{m+r}F^{\lambda}$ (the Schur-Weyl dual of the $S_{|\lambda|}$ module $V^{\lambda}$) with $\left\vert \lambda \right\vert \leq m$ is of the same dimension as the space of $S_{m}$ invariants for ${}_{m}F^{\lambda}$. Multigraded versions of the first type of result are given, as are multigraded generalizations to non-trivial modules of symmetric groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2012 Raghavan, Samuel, and Subrahmanyam showed that the Kazhdan--Lusztig basis for the Iwahori--Hecke algebra in type A provides a ``canonical'' basis for the centraliser algebra of the Schur algebra acting on tensor space. In 2022 the second author found a similar result for the centraliser of the partition algebra acting on the same tensor space. Each basis is indexed by permutations. We exploit these bases to show that the linear decomposition of an arbitrary invariant (in either centraliser algebra) depends integrally on its entries, and describe combinatorial rules that pick out minimal sets of such entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian length category containing a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory $\mathcal{M}$. We prove that a subcategory of $\mathcal{M}$ is a $d$-torsion class if and only if it is closed under $d$-extensions and $d$-quotients. This generalises an important result for classical torsion classes. As an application, we prove that the $d$-torsion classes in $\mathcal{M}$ form a complete lattice. Moreover, we use the characterisation to classify the $d$-torsion classes associated to higher Auslander algebras of type $\mathbb{A}$, and give an algorithm to compute them explicitly. The classification is furthermore extended to the setup of higher Nakayama algebras.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of General Linear Supergroups in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop representation theory of general linear groups in the category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest tensor category which is not Frobenius exact. Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spin Hurwitz numbers, which count ramified covers of the Riemann sphere with a sign coming from a theta characteristic. These numbers are known to be related to Gromov-Witten theory of K\"ahler surfaces and to representation theory of the Sergeev group, and are generated by BKP tau-functions. We use the latter interpretation to give polynomiality properties of these numbers and we derive a spectral curve which we conjecture computes spin Hurwitz numbers via a new type of topological recursion. We prove that this conjectural topological recursion is equivalent to an ELSV-type formula, expressing spin Hurwitz numbers in terms of the Chiodo class twisted by the $2$-spin Witten class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of tensor invariants. We introduce hourglass plabic graphs as a new avatar of webs, and use these to give the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web basis, a long-sought object. The characterization of our basis webs relies on the combinatorics of these new plabic graphs and associated configurations of a symmetrized six-vertex model. We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis. We also discuss how previously known rotation-invariant web bases can be unified in our framework of hourglass plabic graphs.</description>

      <title>Promotion permutations for tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our companion paper, we develop a new $SL_4$-web basis. Basis elements are given by certain planar graphs and are constructed so that important algebraic operations can be performed diagrammatically. A guiding principle behind our construction is that the long cycle $(12\ldots n) \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ should act by rotation of webs. Moreover, the bijection between webs and tableaux should intertwine rotation with the promotion action on tableaux.
  In this paper, we develop necessary notions of promotion permutations and promotion matrices, which are new even for standard tableaux. To support inductive arguments in the companion paper, we must however work in the more general setting of fluctuating tableaux, which we introduce and which subsumes many classes of tableaux that have been previously studied, including (generalized) oscillating, vacillating, rational, alternating, and (semi)standard tableaux. Therefore, we also give here a full development of the basic combinatorics and representation theory of fluctuating tableaux.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\Sigma,\mathbb{M},\mathbb{P})$ be a surface with marked points $\mathbb{M}\subseteq \partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$ and punctures $\mathbb{P}\subseteq\Sigma\setminus\partial\Sigma$. In this paper we show that for every curve $\gamma$ on $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, the curve obtained by resolving the kinks of $\gamma$ in any order is uniquely determined, up to homotopy in $\Sigma\setminus\mathbb{P}$, by the $2$-orbifold homotopy class of $\gamma$, in which the punctures are interpreted to be orbifold points of order $2$. Our proof resorts to an application of the Diamond Lemma.</description>

      <title>Differential graded vertex Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the continuation of the study of differential graded (dg) vertex algebras previously defined by the authors. The goal of this paper is to construct a functor from the category of dg vertex Lie algebras to the category of dg vertex algebras which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor. This functor not only provides an abundant number of examples of dg vertex algebras, but it is also an important step in constructing a homotopy theory in the category of vertex algebras. Vertex Lie algebras were introduced as analogues of vertex algebras, but in which we only consider the singular part of the vertex operator map and the equalities it satisfies. In this paper, we extend the definition of vertex Lie algebras to the dg setting. We construct a pair of adjoint functors between the categories of dg vertex algebras and dg vertex Lie algebras, which leads to the explicit construction of dg vertex (operator) algebras. We will give examples based on the Virasoro algebra, the Neveu-Schwarz algebra, and dg Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to semiorthogonal decompositions for singular projective varieties II: Representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that odd-dimensional projective varieties with tilting objects and only ADE-hypersurface singularities are nodal, i.e. they only have $A_1$-singularities. This is a very special case of more general obstructions to the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions for projective Gorenstein varieties. More precisely, for many isolated hypersurface singularities, we show that Kuznetsov-Shinder's categorical absorptions of singularities cannot contain tilting objects. The key idea is to compare singularity categories of projective varieties to singularity categories of finite-dimensional associative Gorenstein algebras. The former often contain special generators, called cluster-tilting objects, which typically have loops and $2$-cycles in their quivers. In contrast, quivers of cluster-tilting objects in the latter categories, can never have loops or $2$-cycles.</description>
