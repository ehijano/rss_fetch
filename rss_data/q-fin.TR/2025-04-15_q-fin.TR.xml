      <title>Optimal Execution in Intraday Energy Markets under Hawkes Processes with Transient Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal execution strategies in intraday energy markets through a mutually exciting Hawkes process model. Calibrated to data from the German intraday electricity market, the model effectively captures key empirical features, including intra-session volatility, distinct intraday market activity patterns, and the Samuelson effect as gate closure approaches. By integrating a transient price impact model with a bivariate Hawkes process to model the market order flow, we derive an optimal trading trajectory for energy companies managing large volumes, accounting for the specific trading patterns in these markets. A back-testing analysis compares the proposed strategy against standard benchmarks such as Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), demonstrating substantial cost reductions across various hourly trading products in intraday energy markets.</description>

      <title>The Support and Resistance Line Method: An Analysis via Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model motivated by the support/resistance line method in technical analysis where the underlying stock price transitions between three states of nature in a path-dependent manner. For optimal stopping problems with respect to a general class of reward functions and dynamics, using probabilistic methods, we show that the value function is $C^1$ (with respect to the corresponding scale function) and solves a general free boundary problem. Moreover, for a range of utilities, we prove that the best times to buy and sell the stock are obtained by solving free boundary problems corresponding to two linked optimal stopping problems. We use this to compute optimal trading strategies for several types of dynamics and varying degrees of relative risk aversion.</description>
