      <title>TorchLean: Formalizing Neural Networks in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly deployed in safety- and mission-critical pipelines, yet many verification and analysis results are produced outside the programming environment that defines and runs the model. This separation creates a semantic gap between the executed network and the analyzed artifact, so guarantees can hinge on implicit conventions such as operator semantics, tensor layouts, preprocessing, and floating-point corner cases. We introduce TorchLean, a framework in the Lean 4 theorem prover that treats learned models as first-class mathematical objects with a single, precise semantics shared by execution and verification. TorchLean unifies (1) a PyTorch-style verified API with eager and compiled modes that lower to a shared op-tagged SSA/DAG computation-graph IR, (2) explicit Float32 semantics via an executable IEEE-754 binary32 kernel and proof-relevant rounding models, and (3) verification via IBP and CROWN/LiRPA-style bound propagation with certificate checking. We validate TorchLean end-to-end on certified robustness, physics-informed residual bounds for PINNs, and Lyapunov-style neural controller verification, alongside mechanized theoretical results including a universal approximation theorem. These results demonstrate a semantics-first infrastructure for fully formal, end-to-end verification of learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Quadratization of Autonomous Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratization for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a process that transforms a nonquadratic PDE into a quadratic form by introducing auxiliary variables. This symbolic transformation has been used in diverse fields to simplify the analysis, simulation, and control of nonlinear and nonquadratic PDE models. This paper presents a rigorous definition of PDE quadratization, theoretical results for the PDE quadratization problem of spatially one-dimensional PDEs-including results on existence and complexity-and introduces QuPDE, an algorithm based on symbolic computation and discrete optimization that outputs a quadratization for any spatially one-dimensional polynomial or rational PDE. This algorithm is the first computational tool to find quadratizations for PDEs to date. We demonstrate QuPDE's performance by applying it to fourteen nonquadratic PDEs in diverse areas such as fluid mechanics, space physics, chemical engineering, and biological processes. QuPDE delivers a low-order quadratization in each case, uncovering quadratic transformations with fewer auxiliary variables than those previously discovered in the literature for some examples, and finding quadratizations for systems that had not been transformed to quadratic form before.</description>
