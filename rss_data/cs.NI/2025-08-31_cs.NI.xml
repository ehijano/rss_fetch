      <title>A Combined Push-Pull Access Framework for Digital Twin Alignment and Anomaly Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digital twin (DT) contains a set of virtual models of real systems and processes that are synchronized to their physical counterparts. This enables experimentation and examination of counterfactuals, simulating the consequences of decisions in real time. However, the DT accuracy relies on timely updates that maintain alignment with the real system. We can distinguish between: (i) pull-updates, which follow a request from the DT to the sensors, to decrease its drift from the physical state; (ii) push-updates, which are sent directly by the sensors since they represent urgent information, such as anomalies. In this work, we devise a push-pull scheduler (PPS) medium access framework, which dynamically allocates the communication resources used for these two types of updates. Our scheme strikes a balance in the trade-off between DT alignment in normal conditions and anomaly reporting, optimizing resource usage and reducing the drift age of incorrect information (AoII) by over 20% with respect to state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same anomaly detection guarantees, as well as reducing the worst-case anomaly detection AoII from 70 ms to 20 ms when considering a 1 ms average drift AoII constraint.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Proportional Fairness Scheduling for Multi-Flow 5G UEs: A Smart Factory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private 5G networks are emerging as key enablers for smart factories, where a single device often handles multiple concurrent traffic flows with distinct Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Existing simulation frameworks, however, lack the fidelity to model such multi-flow behavior at the QoS Flow Identifier (QFI) level. This paper addresses this gap by extending Simu5G to support per-QFI modeling and by introducing a novel QoS-aware Proportional Fairness (QoS-PF) scheduler. The scheduler dynamically balances delay, Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR), and priority metrics to optimize resource allocation across heterogeneous flows. We evaluate the proposed approach in a realistic smart factory scenario featuring edge-hosted machine vision, real-time control loops, and bulk data transfer. Results show that QoS-PF improves deadline adherence and fairness without compromising throughput. All extensions are implemented in a modular and open-source manner to support future research. Our work provides both a methodological and architectural foundation for simulating and analyzing advanced QoS policies in industrial 5G deployments.</description>

      <title>Towards a Decentralized IoT Onboarding for Smart Homes Using Consortium Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart home devices and IoT-based security systems presents significant opportunities to enhance convenience, safety, and risk management for homeowners and service providers. However, secure onboarding-provisioning credentials and establishing trust with cloud platforms-remains a considerable challenge. Traditional onboarding methods often rely on centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) models and manufacturer-controlled keys, which introduce security risks and limit the user's digital sovereignty. These limitations hinder the widespread deployment of scalable IoT solutions. This paper presents a novel onboarding framework that builds upon existing network-layer onboarding techniques and extends them to the application layer to address these challenges. By integrating consortium blockchain technology, we propose a decentralized onboarding mechanism that enhances transparency, security, and monitoring for smart home architectures. The architecture supports device registration, key revocation, access control management, and risk detection through event-driven alerts across dedicated blockchain channels and smart contracts. To evaluate the framework, we formally model the protocol using the Tamarin Prover under the Dolev-Yao adversary model. The analysis focuses on authentication, token integrity, key confidentiality, and resilience over public channels. A prototype implementation demonstrates the system's viability in smart home settings, with verification completing in 0.34 seconds, highlighting its scalability and suitability for constrained devices and diverse stakeholders. Additionally, performance evaluation shows that the blockchain-based approach effectively handles varying workloads, maintains high throughput and low latency, and supports near real-time IoT data processing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Inter-Flow Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel encrypted traffic classification model that operates directly on raw PCAP data without requiring prior assumptions about traffic type. Unlike existing methods, it is generalizable across multiple classification tasks and leverages inter-flow signals - an innovative representation that captures temporal correlations and packet volume distributions across flows. Experimental results show that our model outperforms well-established methods in nearly every classification task and across most datasets, achieving up to 99% accuracy in some cases, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Resource Allocation for QoS and Stability in Dynamic VLC-NOMA Networks via MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible Light Communication (VLC) combined with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) offers a promising solution for dense indoor wireless networks. Yet, managing resources effectively is challenged by VLC network dynamic conditions involving user mobility and light dimming. In addition to satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) and network stability requirements. Traditional resource allocation methods and simpler RL approaches struggle to jointly optimize QoS and stability under the dynamic conditions of mobile VLC-NOMA networks. This paper presents MARL frameworks tailored to perform complex joint optimization of resource allocation (NOMA power, user scheduling) and network stability (interference, handovers), considering heterogeneous QoS, user mobility, and dimming in VLC-NOMA systems. Our MARL frameworks capture dynamic channel conditions and diverse user QoS , enabling effective joint optimization. In these frameworks, VLC access points (APs) act as intelligent agents, learning to allocate power and schedule users to satisfy diverse requirements while maintaining network stability by managing interference and minimizing disruptive handovers. We conduct a comparative analysis of two key MARL paradigms: 1) Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) and 2) Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE). Comprehensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both tailored MARL frameworks and demonstrate an ability to handle complex optimization. The results show key trade-offs, as the CTDE approach achieved approximately 16\% higher for High priority (HP) user QoS satisfaction, while the CTCE approach yielded nearly 7 dB higher average SINR and 12\% lower ping-pong handover ratio, offering valuable insights into the performance differences between these paradigms in complex VLC-NOMA network scenarios.</description>
