      <title>Error bounds for a uniform asymptotic approximation of the zeros of the Bessel function $J_{\nu}(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent asymptotic expansion for the positive zeros $x=j_{\nu,m}$ ($m=1,2,3,\ldots$) of the Bessel function of the first kind $J_{\nu}(x)$ is studied, where the order $\nu$ is positive. Unlike previous well-known expansions in the literature, this is uniformly valid for one or both $m$ and $\nu$ unbounded, namely $m=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $1 \leq \nu &lt; \infty$. Explicit and simple lower and upper error bounds are derived for the difference between $j_{\nu,m}$ and the first three terms of the expansion. The bounds are sharp in the sense they are close to the value of the fourth term of the expansion (i.e. the first neglected term).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Fourier transformable measure in two dimensions, we find a formula for the intensity of its Fourier transform along circles. In particular, we obtain a formula for the diffraction measure along a circle in terms of the autocorrelation measure. We look at some applications of this formula.</description>

      <title>Minimax and maximin problems for sums of translates on the real axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sums of translates generalize logarithms of weighted algebraic polynomials. The paper presents the solution to the minimax and maximin problems on the real axis for sums of translates. We prove that there is a unique function that is extremal in both problems. The key in our proof is a reduction to the problem on a segment. For this, we work out an analogue of the Mhaskar-Rakhmanov-Saff theorem, too.</description>

      <title>On the $\sigma$-balancing property of multivariate generalized quasi-arithmetic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to characterize the so-called $\sigma$-balancing property in the class of generalized quasi-arithmetic means. In general, the question is whether those elements of a given family of means that possess this property are quasi-arithmetic.
  The first result in the latter direction is due to G. Aumann who showed that a balanced complex mean is necessariliy quasi-arithmetic provided that it is analytic. Then Aumann characterized quasi-arithmetic means among Cauchy means in terms of the balancing property. These results date back to the 1930s. In 2015, Lucio R. Berrone, generalizing balancedness, concluded that a mean having that more general property is quasi-arithmetic if it is symmetric, strict and continuously differentiable. A common feature of these results is that they assume a certain order of differentiability of the mean whether or not it is a natural condition.
  In 2020, the balancing property was characterized in the family of generalized quasi-arithmetic means of two variables under only natural conditions, namely continuity and strict monotonicity of their generating functions. Here we extend the corresponding result for multivariate generalized quasi-arithmetic means by relaxing the conditions on the generating functions and considering the more general $\sigma$-balancing property.</description>

      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of Carleson measures on locally finite trees. This characterization establishes the connection between Carleson measures and the boundedness of a suitable Poisson integral between $L^p$-spaces. Additionally, when the tree has bounded degree, we investigate the relationship between Carleson measures and BMO functions defined on the boundary of the tree.</description>

      <title>Compact bilinear operators and paraproducts revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new proof of the compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols. By drawing an analogy to compact linear operators, we first explore further properties of compact bilinear operators on Banach spaces and present examples. We then prove compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols by combining one of the properties of compact bilinear operators thus obtained with vanishing Carleson measure estimates and interpolation of bilinear compactness.</description>

      <title>Pfaff's Method Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrable Systems arising from Separation of Variables on S3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the family of quantum integrable systems that arise from separating the Schr\"odinger equation in all 6 separable orthogonal coordinates on the 3 sphere: ellipsoidal, prolate, oblate, Lam\'{e}, spherical and cylindrical. On the one hand each separating coordinate system gives rise to a quantum integrable system on S2 x S2, on the other hand it also leads to families of harmonic polynomials in R4. We show that separation in ellipsoidal coordinates yields a generalised Lam\'{e} equation - a Fuchsian ODE with 5 regular singular points. We seek polynomial solutions so that the eigenfunctions are analytic at all finite singularities. We classify eigenfunctions by their discrete symmetry and compute the joint spectrum for each symmetry class. The latter 5 separable coordinate systems are all degenerations of the ellipsoidal coordinates. We perform similar analyses on these systems and show how the ODEs degenerate in a fashion akin to their respective coordinates. For the prolate system we show that there exists a defect in the joint spectrum which prohibits a global assignment of quantum numbers: the system has quantum monodromy. This is a companion paper to our previous work where the respective classical systems were studied.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotic expansions for the zeros of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reformulated uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for ordinary differential equations having a large parameter and a simple turning point. These involve Airy functions, but not their derivatives, unlike traditional asymptotic expansions. From these, asymptotic expansions are derived for the zeros of Bessel functions that are valid for large positive values of the order, uniformly valid for all the zeros. The coefficients in the expansions are explicitly given elementary functions, and similar expansions are derived for the zeros of the derivatives of Bessel functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the monotonicity of the period map in terms of the energy levels for certain periodic solutions of the equation $-\varphi''+\varphi-\varphi^{k}=0$, where $k&gt;1$ is a real number. We present a new approach to demonstrate this property, utilizing spectral information of the corresponding linearized operator around the periodic solution and tools related to Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>On a finite sum of cosecants appearing in various problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the finite sum of cosecants $\sum\csc\big(\varphi+a\pi l/n\big),$ where the index $l$ runs through 1 to $n-1$ and $\varphi$ and $a$ are arbitrary parameters, as well as several closely related sums, such as similar sums of a series of secants, of tangents and of cotangents. These trigonometric sums appear in various problems in mathematics, physics, and a variety of related disciplines. Their particular cases were fragmentarily considered in previous works, and it was noted that even a simple particular case $\sum\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ does not have a closed-form, i.e. a compact summation formula. In the paper, we derive several alternative representations for the above-mentioned sums, study their properties, relate them to many other finite and infinite sums, obtain their complete asymptotic expansions for large $n$ and provide accurate upper and lower bounds (e.g. the typical relative error for the upper bound is lesser than $2\times10^{-9}$ for $n\geqslant10$ and lesser than $7\times10^{-14}$ for $n\geqslant50$, which is much better than the bounds we could find in previous works). Our researches reveal that these sums are deeply related to several special numbers and functions, especially to the digamma function (furthermore, as a by-product, we obtain several interesting summations formulae for the digamma function). Asymptotical studies show that these sums may have qualitatively different behaviour depending on the choice of $\varphi$ and $a$; in particular, as $n$ increases some of them may become sporadically large. Finally, we also provide several historical remarks related to various sums considered in the paper. We show that some results in the field either were rediscovered several times or can easily be deduced from various known formulae, including some formulae dating back to the XVIIIth century.</description>
