      <title>A diagrammatic approach to correlation functions in superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renaud Parentani has given a vast contribution to the development of gravitational analogue models as tools to explore various important aspects of general relativity and of quantum field theory in curved space-time. In these systems, two-point correlation functions are of the utmost importance for the characterization of processes taking place close to the acoustic horizon. In the present paper, dedicated to him, we present a study of path integral methods that allow to determine two-point correlation functions by a perturbative expansion, in a way that -- beyond its generality -- is especially suited to analyze these processes. Our results apply to non-relativistic superfluids, realizable in terrestrial experiments, as well as to relativistic superfluids, relevant for compact stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive angulons in superfluid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the in- and out-of-equilibrium phenomena of a rotational impurity -- specifically, a linear molecule -- coupled to a nonconventional environment, a helium nanodroplet. By employing a Lee-Low-Pines-like transformation combined with a multireference configuration approach, we self-consistently account for the molecule's backaction on the superfluid bath and accurately capture the complex entanglement between the molecule's rotational degrees of freedom and the bath excitations. Our findings reveal that, in the ground state, the impurity induces a density defect in the superfluid bath, giving rise to two novel types of excited states: (a) attractive angulon states, analogous to bound states in photonic crystals and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states in superconductors, localized within the density defect region; and (b) long-lived repulsive angulon states in dilute environments. Rotational spectroscopy demonstrates a crossover from repulsive to attractive angulon states as the bath density increases. This work paves the way for exploring novel nonequilibrium phenomena of quantum impurities in interacting environments.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of a few spin $1/2$ interacting fermions trapped in an harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.10886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the properties of a few interacting spin $1/2$ fermions trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential. The interaction is assumed to be well represented by a contact delta potential. Numerical results obtained by means of direct diagonalization techniques are combined with analytical expressions for both the non-interacting and strongly interacting regime. The $N=2$ case is used to benchmark our numerical techniques with the known exact solution of the problem. After a detailed description of the numerical methods, in a tutorial-like manner, we present the static properties of the system for $N=2, 3, 4$ and 5 particles, e.g. low-energy spectrum, one-body density matrix, ground-state densities. Then, we consider dynamical properties of the system exploring first the excitation of the breathing mode, using the dynamical structure function and corresponding sum-rules, and then a sudden quench of the interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Dipolar magnetostirring protocol for three-well atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a magnetostirring protocol to create persistent currents on an annular system. Under this protocol, polar bosons confined in a three-well ring circuit reach a state with high average circulation. We model the system with an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and show that the protocol can create circulation in an atomtronic circuit for a range of tunable parameters. The performance and robustness of this scheme are examined, in particular considering different interaction regimes. We also present a method for predicting the optimal protocol parameters, which improves protocol's scalability and enables its application to systems with large numbers of bosons. This overcomes computational limitations and paves the way for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>A Radio-Frequency Emitter Design for the Low-Frequency Regime in Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) control is a key technique in cold atom experiments. We present a compact and efficient RF circuit based on a capacitive transformer, where a low-frequency coil operating up to 30 MHz serves as both inductor and power-sharing element. The design enables high current and flexible matching bandwidth, and integrates broadband and narrowband RF manipulation within a unified configuration, overcoming the distance constraints imposed by metallic chambers. In evaporative cooling, the broadband circuit reduces RF input power from 14.7 dBW to -3.5 dBW due to its low-pass behavior, effectively cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to below 10{\mu}K. In a Landau-Zener protocol, the narrowband circuit transfers 80% of rubidium atoms from |F=2, mF=2&gt; to |2, -2&gt; in 1 millisecond, yielding a Rabi frequency of about 7.6 kHz under an input power of 0.1 dBW. The concise design ensures robust impedance matching and stable performance across a wide frequency range, with behavior closely consistent with lumped-element simulations.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature Via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>
