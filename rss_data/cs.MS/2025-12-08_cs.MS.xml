      <title>OpenSQP: A Reconfigurable Open-Source SQP Algorithm in Python for Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods have been remarkably successful in solving a broad range of nonlinear optimization problems. These methods iteratively construct and solve quadratic programming (QP) subproblems to compute directions that converge to a local minimum. While numerous open-source and commercial SQP algorithms are available, their implementations lack the transparency and modularity necessary to adapt and fine-tune them for specific applications or to swap out different modules to create a new optimizer. To address this gap, we present OpenSQP, a modular and reconfigurable SQP algorithm implemented in Python that achieves robust performance comparable to leading algorithms. We implement OpenSQP in a manner that allows users to easily modify or replace components such as merit functions, line search procedures, Hessian approximations, and QP solvers. This flexibility enables the creation of tailored variants of the algorithm for specific needs. To demonstrate reliability, we present numerical results using the standard configuration of OpenSQP that employs a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function for the line search and a quasi-Newton BFGS method for approximating the Hessians. We benchmark this configuration on a comprehensive set of problems from the CUTEst test suite. The results demonstrate performance that is competitive with proven nonlinear optimization algorithms such as SLSQP, SNOPT, and IPOPT.</description>

      <title>Compiler-supported reduced precision and AoS-SoA transformations for heterogeneous hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates AoS-to-SoA transformations over reduced-precision data layouts for a particle simulation code on several GPU platforms: We hypothesize that SoA fits particularly well to SIMT, while AoS is the preferred storage format for many Lagrangian codes. Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Discontinuous Galerkin Consistent Splitting Method for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the consistent splitting scheme proposed by Liu [J. Liu, J. Comp. Phys., 228(19), 2009]. The method enforces the divergence-free constraint implicitly, removing velocity--pressure compatibility conditions and eliminating pressure boundary layers. Consistent boundary conditions are imposed, also for settings with open and traction boundaries. Hence, accuracy in time is no longer limited by a splitting error.
  The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method is used for second spatial derivatives. The convective term is treated in a semi-implicit manner, which relaxes the CFL restriction of explicit schemes while avoiding the need to solve nonlinear systems required by fully implicit formulations. For improved mass conservation, Leray projection is combined with divergence and normal continuity penalty terms.
  By selecting appropriate fluxes for both the divergence of the velocity field and the divergence of the convective operator, the consistent pressure boundary condition can be shown to reduce to contributions arising solely from the acceleration and the viscous term for the $L^2$ discretization. Per time step, the decoupled nature of the scheme with respect to the velocity and pressure fields leads to a single pressure Poisson equation followed by a single vector-valued convection-diffusion-reaction equation. We verify optimal convergence rates of the method in both space and time and demonstrate compatibility with higher-order time integration schemes. A series of numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional flow around a cylinder benchmark and the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex problem, verify the applicability to practically relevant flow problems.</description>
