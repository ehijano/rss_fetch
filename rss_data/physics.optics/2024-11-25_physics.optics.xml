      <title>First-order thermal insensitivity of the frequency of a narrow spectral hole in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of generating an narrow spectral hole in a rare-earth doped crystal opens the gateway to a variety of applications, one of which is the realization of an ultrastable laser. As this is achieved by locking in a pre-stabilized laser to the narrow hole, a prerequisite is the elimination of frequency fluctuations of the spectral hole. One potential source of such fluctuations can arise from temperature instabilities. However, when the crystal is surrounded by a buffer gas subject to the same temperature as the crystal, the effect of temperature-induced pressure changes may be used to counterbalance the direct effect of temperature fluctuations. For a particular pressure, it is indeed possible to identify a temperature for which the spectral hole resonant frequency is independent of the first-order thermal fluctuations. Here, we measure frequency shifts as a function of temperature for different values of the pressure of the surrounding buffer gas, and identify the ``magic'' environment within which the spectral hole is largely insensitive to temperature.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of spectral broadening and few-cycle compression of Yb:KGW laser pulses in gas-filled hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While industrial-grade Yb-based amplifiers have become very prevalent, their limited gain bandwidth has created a large demand for robust spectral broadening techniques that allow for few-cycle pulse compression. In this work, we perform a comparative study between several atomic and molecular gases as media for spectral broadening in a hollow-core fiber geometry. Exploiting nonlinearities such as self-phase modulation, self-steepening, and stimulated Raman scattering, we explore the extent of spectral broadening and its dependence on gas pressure, the critical power for self-focusing, and the optimal regime for few-cycle pulse compression. Using a 3-mJ, 200-fs input laser pulses, we achieve ~ 15 fs, few-cycle pulses with &gt;70% overall energy transmission efficiency. The optimal parameters can be scaled for higher or lower input pulse energies with appropriate gas parameters and fiber geometry.</description>

      <title>SecONN: An Optical Neural Network Framework with Concurrent Detection of Thermal Fault Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Photonics-based AI Accelerators (SPAAs) have been considered as promising AI accelerators achieving high energy efficiency and low latency. While many researchers focus on improving SPAAs' energy efficiency and latency, their physical security has not been sufficiently studied. This paper first proposes a threat of thermal fault injection attacks on SPAAs based on Vector-Matrix Multipliers (VMMs) utilizing Mach-Zhender Interferometers. This paper then proposes SecONN, an optical neural network framework that is capable of not only inferences but also concurrent detection of the attacks. In addition, this paper introduces a concept of Wavelength Division Perturbation (WDP) where wavelength dependent VMM results are utilized to increase detection accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves 88.7% attack-caused average misprediction recall.</description>

      <title>Large-angle twisted photonic crystal semiconductor nanolasers with ultra-low thresholds operating in the C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanolasers, characterized by enhanced optical localization at subwavelength scale, have emerged as promising coherent light sources for ultra-compact, high-speed and energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits. Twisted photonic crystal nanocavity, constructed by stacking two layers of photonic crystal structure with a specified rotation angle, enables strong light confinement with an ultra-small mode volume and an extremely high quality factor. The twisted angle can be randomly selected, providing the possibility of actively tuning the resonant wavelength and optical mode distribution within a nanoscale twisted cavity. Here, we demonstrate large-angle twisted single-mode photonic crystal nanolasers operating in the C-band with an exceptionally ultra-compact footprint of approximately 25 $\mu m^2$ and an ultra-small mode volume of 0.47 $(\lambda/n)^3$. The reported twisted photonic crystal nanolasers are optically pumped at room temperature with an ultra-low threshold of $\sim$ 1.25 $kW/cm^2$. Our work provides a prospective method for easily constructing robust nanolasers by twisting angles, and paves the way for achieving high-performance nanoscale coherent light sources for densely integrated photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dark solitons and oscillatory dynamics in microcavity polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark solitons carrying quantized phase information arouse great interest in different nonlinear systems. A dark soliton in 1D can be stabilized in microcavity polariton condensates as a confinement is imposed on it to prevent its decay. Such a confinement can be realized by optical manners, i.e., by using optically induced potential traps. Under nonresonant excitation with spatially periodically modulated optical beams, we numerically demonstrate that besides fundamental dark solitons, higher-order dark solitons with multiple density minima and $\pi$-phase jumps can also stably survive in the potential (pump) valleys. Simultaneously exciting several orders of dark soliton states by properly choosing the lattice constant of the optical pump gives rise to dark oscillators. In some cases, the stably trapped dark solitons in adjacent pump valleys squeeze the condensate density between them and generate another type of density dips in the pump peak area. Surprisingly, such a density dip supports another stable dark soliton with a larger size which is essentially composed of two counter-propagating gray solitons.</description>

      <title>2D Semiconductors Superlattices as Hyperbolic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials are natural or engineered artificial structures that provide means to manipulate and control electromagnetic radiation, leading to a variety of strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. In this work, we explore the physical properties of the optical response of 2D semiconductor-based superlattices, which are engineered with atomic precision and composed of alternating 2D semiconductor monolayers and hexagonal-boron-nitride. We find that such superlattices exhibit a robust hyperbolic response at the visible to near-infrared spectrum, and with dimensions that are an order of magnitude smaller compared to conventional metal-based hyperbolic metamaterials, down to three active monolayers. By employing both analytical and numerical studies, we show that by varying the superlattice configuration we can control and manipulate the nature of the hyperbolic response. Finaly, we propose an optimal structure that will enable the experimental observation of this hyperbolic response in 2D semiconductors superlattices. Such highly compact hyperbolic materials of atomic precision could open the way for deep-subwavelength optoelectronic devices with extremely small footprint.</description>

      <title>Time Interfaces in Nanoplasma-Switched Wire Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider instantaneous transitions of an infinitely extended uniaxial dielectric into a wire medium (WM) of continuous infinitely long conducting wires. Due to the strong spatial dispersion in the WM the known (Morgenthaler's) theory of temporal discontinuities is not applicable. We solve this problem analytically in time domain. We show that a transverse electromagnetic (TM) plane wave transforms into four waves: a pair of TM waves and a pair of transverse electromagnetic waves. This way, the power flow splits into two different directions, with one of them along the wires. Such a transition can possibly be achieved by nanoplasma discharges in the gaps of the split wires, initiated by an external voltage source applied to the wire and transforming the split wires forming the uniaxial dielectric into continuous ones.</description>

      <title>Manipulating spectral transitions and photonic transmission in a non-Hermitian optical system through nanoparticle perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this letter, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we demonstrate that by precisely manipulating the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues(or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Encircled Higher-order Exceptional Points in an Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique properties of exceptional point (EP) singularities, arising from non-Hermitian physics, have unlocked new possibilities for manipulating light-matter interactions. A tailored gain-loss variation, while encircling higher-order EPs dynamically, can significantly enhance the control of the topological flow of light in multi-level photonic systems. In particular, the integration of dynamically encircled higher-order EPs within fiber geometries holds remarkable promise for advancing specialty optical fiber applications, though a research gap remains in exploring and realizing such configurations. Here, we report a triple-core specialty optical fiber engineered with customized loss and gain to explore the topological characteristics of a third-order exceptional point (EP3), formed by two interconnected second-order exceptional points (EP2s). We elucidate chiral and nonchiral light transmission through the fiber, grounded in second- and third-order branch point behaviors and associated adiabatic and nonadiabatic modal characteristics, while considering various dynamical parametric loops to encircle the embedded EPs. We investigate the persistence of EP-induced light dynamics specifically in the parametric regions immediately adjacent to, though not encircling, the embedded EPs, potentially leading to improved device performance. Our findings offer significant implications for the design and implementation of novel light management technologies in all-fiber photonics and communications.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss and Low-Power Silicon Ring Based WDM 32$\times$100 GHz Filter Enabled by a Novel Bend Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring resonators are crucial in silicon photonics for various applications, but conventional designs face performance trade-offs. Here a third-order polynomial interconnected circular (TOPIC) bend is proposed to revolutionize the ring designs fundamentally. The TOPIC bend has a unique feature of continuous curvature and curvature derivative, which is theoretically derived to be essential for waveguide loss optimization. With the TOPIC bend, the silicon ring resonators demonstrated here have achieved three records to the best of our knowledge: the smallest radius (0.7 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) for silicon rings resonating with single guided mode, the lowest thermal tuning power (5.85 mW/$\pi$) for silicon rings with FSR $\geq$3.2 THz, and the first silicon ring-based WDM 32$\times$100 GHz filter. The filter has doubled the channel amount compared to the state of the art, and meanwhile achieved low insertion loss (1.91 $\pm$ 0.28 dB) and low tuning power (283 GHz/mW). Moreover, the TOPIC bend is not limited to ring applications, it can also be used to create bends with an arbitrary angle, with the advantages of ultra-compact radius and heater integration, which are expected to replace all circular bends in integrated photonics, greatly reducing system size and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Significant loss suppression and large induced chirality via cooperative near- and far-field coupling in plasmonic dimer nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas containing nano-gaps support "hotspots" for greatly enhanced light-matter interactions, but suffer from inherent high losses, a long-standing issue that hinders practical applications. Here we report a strategy to significantly suppress the losses of plasmonic dimer nanoantennas. Specifically, by introducing the concept of cooperative near- and far-field coupling, we observed an unprecedented transition from the weak coupling of localized resonances to strong coupling of collective (nonlocal) resonances, showing robustness to the gap distance between the dimer. We develop a generalized lattice sum approximation model to describe this transition and reveal its origins: the off-diagonal element of the anisotropic polarizability tensor due to near-field coupling, and the anisotropic lattice sums due to far-field coupling. This strong coupling leads to loss-suppressed plasmonic resonances with large modulation depths and meanwhile extremely high measured quality factors up to 3120 in the near-infrared regime, exceeding the record in the near infrared regime. Additionally, high-$Q$ and large chiroptical responses can also be induced for achiral planar dimers under the critical coupling condition. This work paves an avenue toward extremely low-loss plasmonic devices, either chiral or not, for diverse important applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Efficiency Dual-Band Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Modulator Incorporating Low-k Underfill with 220 GHz Extrapolated Bandwidth for 390 Gbit/s PAM8 Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance electro-optic modulators play a critical role in modern telecommunication networks and intra-datacenter interconnects. Low driving voltage, large electro-optic bandwidth, compact device size, and multi-band operation ability are essential for various application scenarios, especially energy-efficient high-speed data transmission. However, it is challenging to meet all these requirements simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance dual-band thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic modulator with low-k underfill to achieve overall performance improvement. The low-k material helps reduce the RF loss of the modulator and achieve perfect velocity matching with narrow electrode gap to overcome the voltage-bandwidth limitation, extending electro-optic bandwidth and enhancing modulation efficiency simultaneously. The fabricated 7-mm-long modulator exhibits a low half-wave voltage of 1.9 V at C-band and 1.54 V at O-band, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 1.33 V*cm and 1.08 V*cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the novel design yields an ultra-wide extrapolated 3 dB bandwidth of 220 GHz (218 GHz) in the C-band (O-band). High-speed data transmission in both C- and O-bands using the same device has been demonstrated for the first time by PAM8 with data rates up to 390 Gbit/s, corresponding to a record-low energy consumption of 0.69 fJ/bit for next-generation cost-effective ultra-high-speed optical communications.</description>

      <title>Comment on Quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for enhanced object detection (Opt. Express 32, 40150-40164, 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper by K. Sengupta et al. (Opt. Express 32, 40150-40164, 2024) explores quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for object detection in noisy environments. In this comment, we highlight fundamental flaws in the mathematical model used to describe photon loss. We argue that the treatment of photon loss and its effects on quantum entanglement is incorrect. We demonstrate that the conclusions of Sengupta et al., particularly the detection of low-reflectivity objects using quantum correlations, are unsubstantiated, as the assumed resilience of polarization entanglement to photon loss contradicts established principles of quantum information theory. We present a more rigorous framework for describing the effects of photon loss on both polarization-encoded and photon-number quantum states. Additionally, we critique the approach used in the OE article to model photon loss in free-space optical (FSO) transmission, noting that it is based on a fiber-optic model that was adopted with insufficient attribution from an earlier publication. We propose several improvements to enhance the modeling of FSO photon loss.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by Hui et al. (Ref. [1], Sci. Adv. 10, eadp5805 (2024)) claims the demonstration of 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction' with laser-gated electron pulses. In this comment, we point out a series of physical and technical inconsistencies of the experiment and results. Beyond failing to show any microscopy, the reported concept does not produce properly gated electrons. Furthermore, the noise and signal levels of the presented data are statistically and quantitatively incompatible with the work's interpretation and attosecond dynamics in graphite. These inconsistencies render the claims and conclusions of Ref. [1] unsubstantiated and suggest that the data primarily show an interferometric artifact.</description>

      <title>Advanced LIGO detector performance in the fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On May 24th, 2023, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors, began the fourth observing run for a two-year-long dedicated search for gravitational waves. The LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors have achieved an unprecedented sensitivity to gravitational waves, with an angle-averaged median range to binary neutron star mergers of 152 Mpc and 160 Mpc, and duty cycles of 65.0% and 71.2%, respectively, with a coincident duty cycle of 52.6%. The maximum range achieved by the LIGO Hanford detector is 165 Mpc and the LIGO Livingston detector 177 Mpc, both achieved during the second part of the fourth observing run. For the fourth run, the quantum-limited sensitivity of the detectors was increased significantly due to the higher intracavity power from laser system upgrades and replacement of core optics, and from the addition of a 300 m filter cavity to provide the squeezed light with a frequency-dependent squeezing angle, part of the A+ upgrade program. Altogether, the A+ upgrades led to reduced detector-wide losses for the squeezed vacuum states of light which, alongside the filter cavity, enabled broadband quantum noise reduction of up to 5.2 dB at the Hanford observatory and 6.1 dB at the Livingston observatory. Improvements to sensors and actuators as well as significant controls commissioning increased low frequency sensitivity. This paper details these instrumental upgrades, analyzes the noise sources that limit detector sensitivity, and describes the commissioning challenges of the fourth observing run.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical deconstruction of vibrational energy transfer rate and pathways modified by collective vibrational strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and the optical cavity field can modify vibrational energy transfer (VET) processes in molecular systems. However, the underlying mechanisms and the behavior of individual molecules under collective VSC remain largely incomplete. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art quantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamics simulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how the vibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the (H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSC breaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches, and opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving both neighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET process relies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of the corresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathways is found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OH stretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in mode coupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirm and extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes but also provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Cryptographic Conferencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum networks. Due to the fragility and low generation rate of genuine multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging. Measurement-device-independent QCC (MDI-QCC), which removes all detector side-channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDI-QCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI-QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</description>

      <title>VO$_2$ films grown on TiO$_2$ sub-layer: influence of thickness on structural, electrical and optical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO$_2$-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO$_2$ properties in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO$_2$ films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO$_2$ layer thickness in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$ composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO$_2$ lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO$_2$ layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO$_2$ thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO$_2$ lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO$_2$ layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO$_2$ films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO$_2$ films revealed that VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO$_2$ film to be as low as 800 ns.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Optical Bistability of Photon Avalanching Nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically bistable materials respond to a single input with two possible optical outputs, contingent upon excitation history. Such materials would be ideal for optical switching and memory, yet limited understanding of intrinsic optical bistability (IOB) prevents development of nanoscale IOB materials suitable for devices. Here, we demonstrate IOB in Nd3+-doped KPb2Cl5 avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs), which switch with high contrast between luminescent and non-luminescent states, with hysteresis characteristic of bistability. We elucidate a nonthermal mechanism in which IOB originates from suppressed nonradiative relaxation in Nd3+ ions and from the positive feedback of photon avalanching, resulting in extreme, &gt;200th-order optical nonlinearities. Modulation of laser pulsing tunes hysteresis widths, and dual-laser excitation enables transistor-like optical switching. This control over nanoscale IOB establishes ANPs for photonic devices in which light is used to manipulate light.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive pump-probe measurement of the complex nonlinear susceptibility of silicon across the direct band edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear response of materials, an increasingly important aspect of light-matter interaction, can be challenging to measure in highly absorbing materials. Here, we introduce an interferometric technique that enables a direct measurement of the nonlinear complex permittivity in a bulk medium from reflectivity alone. We demonstrate the utility of pump-probe supercontinuum (SC) spectral interferometry in reflection by measuring time-dependent variations in the complex dielectric function ($n$, $k$) over the visible wavelength range in bulk silicon. Transient phase shifts in the reflected SC due to a near infrared pump pulse allow us to track modifications to $k$; whereas changes in $n$ are derived from transient fluctuations in the reflected SC probe amplitude. The ultrafast response is attributed to effective two-photon absorption ($\beta$) and Kerr ($n_2$) coefficients. We observe the onset of strong two-photon absorption as the two-photon energy is tuned through the direct band edge of silicon ($E_1$ = 3.4 eV) for the first time to our knowledge. This technique allows straightforward spectroscopic measurements of the $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear response at the surface of absorbing materials.</description>

Abstract: The rise of the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform marks a promising pathway towards the realization of monolithic quantum photonic networks. However, the challenge of establishing room-temperature entangled registers on these integrated photonics platforms remains unresolved. Herein, we demonstrate the first entangled processor on the SiCOI platform. We show that both deterministic generation of single divacancy electron spins and near-unity spin initialization of a single $^{13}$C nuclear spin can be achieved on SiCOI at room temperature. Besides coherently manipulating the single nuclear spin, a maximally entangled state with a fidelity of 0.89 has been prepared on this CMOS-compatible semiconductor-integrated photonics system. This work establishes the foundation for compact and on-chip solutions within existing defect-based computing and sensing protocols, positioning the SiCOI platform as the most promising candidate for integrated monolithic quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>
