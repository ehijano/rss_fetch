      <title>Intergenerational cross-subsidies in UK collective defined contribution (CDC) funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of and level of intergenerational cross subsidy in single-employer and multi-employer collective defined contribution (CDC) schemes which have been designed to be compatible with UK legislation. The single-employer scheme captures the essential features of the Royal Mail CDC scheme, which is currently the only UK CDC scheme. We find that the schemes can be successful in smoothing pension outcomes while outperforming a DC + annuity scheme, but that this outperformance is not guaranteed in a single-employer scheme. There are significant intergenerational cross-subsidies in the single-employer scheme. These qualitatively mirror the cross-subsidies seen in existing defined benefit schemes, but we find the magnitude of the cross-subsidies is much larger in single employer CDC schemes. The multi-employer scheme is intended to minimize such cross-subsidies, but we find that such subsidies still arise due to the approximate pricing methodology implicit in the scheme design. These cross-subsidies tend to cancel out over time, but in any given year they can be large, implying that it is important to use a rigorous pricing methodology when valuing collective pension investments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Central Banks in Advancing Sustainable Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the pivotal role central banks play in advancing sustainable finance, a crucial component in addressing global environmental and social challenges. As supervisors of financial stability and economic growth, central banks have dominance over the financial system to influence how a country moves towards sustainable economy. The chapter explores how central banks integrate sustainability into their monetary policies, regulatory frameworks, and financial market operations. It highlights the ways in which central banks can promote green finance through sustainable investment principles, climate risk assessments, and green bond markets. Additionally, the chapter examines the collaborative efforts between central banks, governments, and international institutions to align financial systems with sustainability goals. By investigating case studies and best practices, the chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the strategies central banks employ to foster a resilient and sustainable financial landscape. The findings underscore the imperative for central banks to balance traditional mandates with the emerging necessity to support sustainable development, ultimately contributing to the broader agenda of achieving global sustainability targets.</description>

      <title>The Value of Information from Sell-side Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine the value of information from sell-side analysts by analyzing a large corpus of their written reports. Using embeddings from state-of-the-art large language models, I show that textual information in analyst reports explains 10.19% of contemporaneous stock returns out-of-sample, a value that is economically more significant than quantitative forecasts. I then perform a Shapley value decomposition to assess how much each topic within the reports contributes to explaining stock returns. The results show that analysts' income statement analyses account for more than half of the reports' explanatory power. Expressing these findings in economic terms, I estimate that early acquisition of analysts' reports can yield significant profits. Analysts' information value peeks in the first week following earnings announcements, highlighting their vital role in interpreting new financial data.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Analysis of Cryptocurrencies -- Non-Linear Dynamics in High Frequency Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform some analysis for the probability distributions in the space of frequency and time variables. However, in the domain of high frequencies, it behaves in such a way as the highly non-linear dynamics. The wavelet analysis is a powerful tool to perform such analysis in order to search for the characteristics of frequency variations over time for the prices of major cryptocurrencies. In fact, the wavelet analysis is found to be quite useful as it examine the validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the weak form, especially for the presence of the cyclical persistence at different frequencies. If we could find some cyclical persistence at different frequencies, that means that there exist some intrinsic causal relationship for some given investment horizons defined by some chosen sampling scales. This is one of the characteristic results of the wavelet analysis in the time-frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Chat Bankman-Fried: an Exploration of LLM Alignment in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have renewed concerns about AI alignment - the consistency between human and AI goals and values. As various jurisdictions enact legislation on AI safety, the concept of alignment must be defined and measured across different domains. This paper proposes an experimental framework to assess whether LLMs adhere to ethical and legal standards in the relatively unexplored context of finance. We prompt nine LLMs to impersonate the CEO of a financial institution and test their willingness to misuse customer assets to repay outstanding corporate debt. Beginning with a baseline configuration, we adjust preferences, incentives and constraints, analyzing the impact of each adjustment with logistic regression. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the baseline propensity for unethical behavior of LLMs. Factors such as risk aversion, profit expectations, and regulatory environment consistently influence misalignment in ways predicted by economic theory, although the magnitude of these effects varies across LLMs. This paper highlights both the benefits and limitations of simulation-based, ex post safety testing. While it can inform financial authorities and institutions aiming to ensure LLM safety, there is a clear trade-off between generality and cost.</description>
