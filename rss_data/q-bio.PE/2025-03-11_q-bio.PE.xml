      <title>Invasion dynamics of super invaders: Elimination of Allee effects by a strategy at the range boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a reaction-diffusion model with free boundaries in one space dimension for a single population species with density $u(t,x)$ and population range $[g(t), h(t)]$, we demonstrate that the Allee effects can be eliminated if the species maintains its population density at a suitable level at the range boundary by advancing or retreating the fronts. It is proved that with such a strategy at the range edge the species can invade the environment successfully with all admissible initial populations, exhibiting the dynamics of super invaders. Numerical simulations are used to help understand what happens if the population density level at the range boundary is maintained at other levels. If the invading cane toads in Australia used this strategy at the range boundary to become a super invader, then our results may explain why toads near the invading front evolve to have longer legs and run faster.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Time to Extinction of an SIQS Epidemic Model with Quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parasite quiescence is the ability for the pathogen to be inactive, with respect to metabolism and infectiousness, for some amount of time and then become active (infectious) again. The population is thus composed of an inactive proportion, and an active part in which evolution and reproduction takes place. In this paper, we investigate the effect of parasite quiescence on the time to extinction of infectious disease epidemics. We build a Susceptible-Infected-Quiescent-Susceptible (SIQS) epidemiological model. Hereby, host individuals infected by a quiescent parasite strain cannot recover, but are not infectious. We particularly focus on stochastic effects. We show that the quiescent state does not affect the reproduction number, but for a wide range of parameters the model behaves as an SIS model at a slower time scale, given by the fraction of time infected individuals are within the I state (and not in the Q state). This finding, proven using a time scale argument and singular perturbation theory for Markov processes, is illustrated and validated by numerical experiments based on the quasi-steady state distribution. We find here that the result even holds without a distinct time scale separation. Our results highlight the influence of quiescence as a bet-hedging strategy against disease stochastic extinction, and are relevant for predicting infectious disease dynamics in small populations.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of chytridiomycosis transmission in frogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease, primarily caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, that poses a major threat to frog populations worldwide, driving at least 90 amphibian species to extinction, and severely affecting hundreds of others. Difficulties in management of this disease have shown a need for novel conservation approaches.
  In this paper, we present a novel dynamic mathematical model for chytridiomycosis transmission in frogs that includes the natural history of infection, to test the hypothesis that sunlight-heated refugia reduce transmission in frog populations. This model was fit using approximate Bayesian computation to experimental data where frogs were separated into cohorts based the amount of heat the refugia received.
  Our results show that the effect of sunlight-heating the refugia reduced infection in frogs by 40%. Further, frogs that were infected and recovered had significant protection, with a reduction in susceptibility of approximately 97% compared to naive frogs. The mathematical model can be used to gain further insight into using sunlight-heated refugia to reduce chytridiomycosis prevalence amongst amphibians.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Epidemic Models with Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of epidemics often use compartmental models dividing the population into several compartments. Based on a microscopic setting describing the temporal evolution of the subpopulation sizes in the compartments by stochastic counting processes one can derive macroscopic models for large populations describing the average behavior by associated ordinary differential equations such as the celebrated SIR model. Further, diffusion approximations allow to address fluctuations from the average and to describe the state dynamics also for smaller populations by stochastic differential equations.
  In general, not all state variables are directly observable, and we face the so-called "dark figure" problem, which concerns, for example, the unknown number of asymptomatic and undetected infections. The present study addresses this problem by developing stochastic epidemic models that incorporate partial information about the current state of the epidemic, also known as nowcast uncertainty. Examples include a simple extension of the SIR model, a model for a disease with lifelong immunity after infection or vaccination, and a Covid-19 model. For the latter, we propose a ``cascade state approach'' that allows to exploit the information contained in formally hidden compartments with observable inflow but unobservable outflow. Furthermore, parameter estimation and calibration are performed using ridge regression for the Covid-19 model. The results of the numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Photometric Decision-Making During the Dawn Choruses of Cicadas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first quantitative study of the onset of dawn choruses of cicadas in several natural habitats. A time-frequency analysis of the acoustical signals is used to define an order parameter for the development of collective singing. The ensemble of recordings reveals that the chorus onset times accurately track the changing sunrise times over the course of many weeks, occurring within civil twilight at a solar elevation of -$3.8^\circ \pm 0.2^\circ$. Despite day-to-day variations in the amplitude of fully developed choruses, the order parameter data collapse to a common sigmoidal curve when scaled by those amplitudes and shifted by the onset time, revealing a characteristic rise time of ~60 s for a chorus to reach saturation amplitude. The results are used to obtain the cumulative distribution function of singing as a function of ground illumination, from which is obtained a generalized susceptibility which exhibits a narrow peak with a half-width of $\sim\! 12\%$. The variance of the order parameter exhibits a similar peak, suggesting that a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds for this system. A model of decision-making under ramps of a control parameter is developed and can achieve a quantitative match to the data. It suggest that sharpness of the susceptibility peak reflects cooperative decision-making arising from acoustic communication.</description>
