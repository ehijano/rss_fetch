      <title>A Runtime Analysis of the Multi-Valued Compact Genetic Algorithm on Generalized LeadingOnes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature on runtime analyses of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), researchers have recently explored univariate EDAs for multi-valued decision variables. Particularly, Jedidia et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued UMDA on the r-valued LeadingOnes (r-LeadingOnes) functions and Adak et al. gave the first runtime analysis of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) on the r-valued OneMax function. We utilize their framework to conduct an analysis of the multi-valued cGA on the r-valued LeadingOnes function. Even for the binary case, a runtime analysis of the classical cGA on LeadingOnes was not yet available. In this work, we show that the runtime of the r-cGA on r-LeadingOnes is O(n^2r^2 log^3 n log^2 r) with high probability.</description>

      <title>Intelligent OLSR Routing Protocol Optimization for VANETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in wireless technologies have given rise to the emergence of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In such networks, the limited coverage of WiFi and the high mobility of the nodes generate frequent topology changes and network fragmentations. For these reasons, and taking into account that there is no central manager entity, routing packets through the network is a challenging task. Therefore, offering an efficient routing strategy is crucial to the deployment of VANETs. This paper deals with the optimal parameter setting of the optimized link state routing (OLSR), which is a well-known mobile ad hoc network routing protocol, by defining an optimization problem. This way, a series of representative metaheuristic algorithms (particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing) are studied in this paper to find automatically optimal configurations of this routing protocol. In addition, a set of realistic VANET scenarios (based in the city of M\'alaga) have been defined to accurately evaluate the performance of the network under our automatic OLSR. In the experiments, our tuned OLSR configurations result in better quality of service (QoS) than the standard request for comments (RFC 3626), as well as several human experts, making it amenable for utilization in VANET configurations.</description>

      <title>Parallel multi-objective metaheuristics for smart communications in vehicular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyzes the use of two parallel multi-objective soft computing algorithms to automatically search for high-quality settings of the Ad hoc On Demand Vector routing protocol for vehicular networks. These methods are based on an evolutionary algorithm and on a swarm intelligence approach. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the configurations computed by our optimization algorithms outperform other state-of-the-art optimized ones. In turn, the computational efficiency achieved by all the parallel versions is greater than 87 %. Therefore, the line of work presented in this article represents an efficient framework to improve vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Quantum Advantage in Quantum Circuit Generation through Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits that leverage quantum advantage compared to classical computing has become increasingly critical. Genetic algorithms have shown potential in generating such circuits through artificial evolution. However, integrating quantum advantage into the fitness function of these algorithms remains unexplored. In this paper, we aim to enhance the efficiency of quantum circuit design by proposing two novel approaches for incorporating quantum advantage metrics into the fitness function of genetic algorithms.1 We evaluate our approaches based on the Bernstein-Vazirani Problem and the Unstructured Database Search Problem as test cases. The results demonstrate that our approaches not only improve the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm but also produce circuits comparable to expert-designed solutions. Our findings suggest that automated quantum circuit design using genetic algorithms that incorporate a measure of quantum advantage is a promising approach to accelerating the development of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</description>
