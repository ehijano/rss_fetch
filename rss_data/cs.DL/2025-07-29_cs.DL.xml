      <title>Permanent Data Encoding (PDE): A Visual Language for Semantic Compression and Knowledge Preservation in 3-Character Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent Data Encoding (PDE) is a visual language framework designed for long-term, human-readable, and electrically independent knowledge preservation. By encoding semantic content into compact 2-3 character alphanumeric codes, paired with public dictionaries and rule-based expansion structures, PDE enables information to be visually interpreted and logically reconstructed without reliance on digital systems. Unlike QR codes or binary data, PDE offers a transparent and self-contained method of encoding meaning. This paper outlines the PDE syntax, dictionary protocol, use cases in disaster resilience and AI integration, and its implications as a cross-generational semantic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Matching Game Preferences Through Dialogical Large Language Models: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to share their different preferences through structured conversations. This approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine, understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Aging and the Narrowing of Scientific Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With rising life expectancies around the world and an older scientific workforce than ever before, what does aging mean for individual scientists, and what do aging scientists mean for scientific progress as a whole? Here we examine how scientists and scholars age in terms of how their ideas and contributions relate to the evolving frontier of knowledge and how demographically aging fields relate to field-level advance. At the individual level, we examine how research experiences and choices can moderate the effects of intellectual aging. At the collective level, we explore mechanisms that link individual and collective aging. Prior research focuses on star scientists, their changing dates and rates of breakthrough success throughout history. We explore this for scientists in all fields over time, drawing upon novel deep learning measurements that allow us not only to trace positive attention through citation but also negative attention through explicit criticism with a novel, comprehensive database of over 20,000 human-validated critical citations. We find that younger scientists tend toward disruptive contributions that push the frontier, while older scientists engage in combinatorial innovation with an aging collection of components. This includes analyzing the impact of the 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on mandatory retirement and examining how unexpected collaborations affect citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Representing provenance and track changes of cultural heritage metadata in RDF: a survey of existing approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of Digital Humanities, the management of cultural heritage metadata is pivotal for ensuring data trustworthiness. Provenance information - contextual metadata detailing the origin and history of data - plays a crucial role in this process. However, tracking provenance and changes in metadata using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) presents significant challenges due to the limitations of foundational Semantic Web technologies. This article offers a comprehensive review of existing models and approaches for representing provenance and tracking changes in RDF, with a specific focus on cultural heritage metadata. It examines W3C standard proposals such as RDF Reification and n-ary relations, along with various alternative systems. Through an in-depth analysis, the study identifies Named Graphs, RDF*, the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O), Dublin Core (DC), Conjectural Graphs, and the OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM) as the most effective solutions. These models are evaluated based on their compliance with RDF standards, scalability, and applicability across different domains. The findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model to ensure robust and reliable management of provenance in RDF datasets, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on provenance representation in the Digital Humanities.</description>

      <title>Understanding discrepancies in the coverage of OpenAlex: the case of China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citation indexes play a crucial role for understanding how science is produced, disseminated, and used. However, these databases often face a critical trade-off: those offering extensive and high-quality coverage are typically proprietary, whereas publicly accessible datasets frequently exhibit fragmented coverage and inconsistent data quality. OpenAlex was developed to address this challenge, providing a freely available database with broad open coverage, with a particular emphasis on non-English speaking countries. Yet, few studies have assessed the quality of the OpenAlex dataset. This paper assesses the coverage, by OpenAlex, of China's papers, which shows an abnormal trend, and compares it with other countries that do not have English as their main language. Our analysis reveals that while OpenAlex increases the coverage of China's publications, primarily those disseminated by a national database, this coverage is incomplete and discontinuous when compared to other countries' records in the database. We observe similar issues in other non-English-speaking countries, with coverage varying across regions. These findings indicate that although OpenAlex expands coverage of research outputs, continuity issues persist and disproportionately affect certain countries. We emphasize the need for researchers to use OpenAlex data cautiously, being mindful of its potential limitations in cross-national analyses.</description>
