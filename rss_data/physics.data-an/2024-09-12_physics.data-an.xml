      <title>Why aphids are not pests in cacao? An approach based on a predator-prey model with aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied a mean-field predator-prey model with aging to simulate the \mbox{interaction} between aphids (\textit{Toxoptera aurantii}) and syrphid larvae in \mbox{cacao} farms in Ilheus, Bahia. Based on the classical predator-prey model, we \mbox{propose} a system of differential equations with three rate equations. \mbox{Unlike} the original Lotka-Volterra model, our model includes two aphid population classes: juveniles (non-breeding) and adult females (asexually breeding). We obtained steady-state solutions for juvenile and adult populations by \mbox{analyzing} the stability of the fixed points as a function of model \mbox{parameters}. The results show that the absorbing state (zero prey population) is always possible, but not consistently stable. A nonzero stationary solution is achievable with appropriate parameter values. Using phase diagrams, we analyzed the \mbox{stationary} solution, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics involved. Simulations on complete graphs yielded results closely matching the differential equations. We also performed simulations on random networks to highlight the influence of network topology on system behavior.</description>

      <title>Toward Model-Agnostic Detection of New Physics Using Data-Driven Signal Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for new particles in high-energy physics, it is crucial to select the Signal Region (SR) in such a way that it is enriched with signal events if they are present. While most existing search methods set the region relying on prior domain knowledge, it may be unavailable for a completely novel particle that falls outside the current scope of understanding. We address this issue by proposing a method built upon a model-agnostic but often realistic assumption about the localized topology of the signal events, in which they are concentrated in a certain area of the feature space. Considering the signal component as a localized high-frequency feature, our approach employs the notion of a low-pass filter. We define the SR as an area which is most affected when the observed events are smeared with additive random noise. We overcome challenges in density estimation in the high-dimensional feature space by learning the density ratio of events that potentially include a signal to the complementary observation of events that closely resemble the target events but are free of any signals. By applying our method to simulated $\mathrm{HH} \rightarrow 4b$ events, we demonstrate that the method can efficiently identify a data-driven SR in a high-dimensional feature space in which a high portion of signal events concentrate.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions were revealed based on Potential Learning (PL), and dependence of particular solar wind plasma density (NP) on moderate geomagnetic conditions was discussed. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity NP begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp ranges under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed (VX), and NP obtained from the 21-year OMNI solar wind database were used as the PL input parameters. PL extracted VX as the most significant parameter for the moderate Kp level under southward IMF conditions and NP is the second most influential parameter. Based on the examination of the statistical relationship between VX and NP under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp levels using the PL database, geomagnetic conditions remain high while NP becomes large, even if VX decreases (or remains similar). This shows that both VX and NP govern geomagnetic activity, following the relational equation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. Based on the relation between VX and NP clarified by PL and incidental statistical studies using PL input data, we also revealed that NP begins to affect the Kp level from moderate geomagnetic activity level. These results suggest that even under southward IMF conditions, the geomagnetic activity might be influenced by fast (slow) VX and low (high) NP. Our results would greatly help understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions, and forecast the geomagnetic activity under extreme solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>

      <title>Inferring parameters and reconstruction of two-dimensional turbulent flows with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining system parameters and reconstructing the full flow state from limited velocity observations using conventional fluid dynamics solvers can be prohibitively expensive. Here we employ machine learning algorithms to overcome the challenge. As an example, we consider a moderately turbulent fluid flow, excited by a stationary force and described by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with linear bottom friction. Using dense in time, spatially sparse and probably noisy velocity data, we reconstruct the spatially dense velocity field, infer the pressure and driving force up to a harmonic function and its gradient, respectively, and determine the unknown fluid viscosity and friction coefficient. Both the root-mean-square errors of the reconstructions and their energy spectra are addressed. We study the dependence of these metrics on the degree of sparsity and noise in the velocity measurements. Our approach involves training a physics-informed neural network by minimizing the loss function, which penalizes deviations from the provided data and violations of the governing equations. The suggested technique extracts additional information from velocity measurements, potentially enhancing the capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry.</description>

      <title>Countering adversarial perturbations in graphs using error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a graph subjected to adversarial perturbations, such as those arising from cyber-attacks, where edges are covertly added or removed. The adversarial perturbations occur during the transmission of the graph between a sender and a receiver. To counteract potential perturbations, this study explores a repetition coding scheme with sender-assigned noise and majority voting on the receiver's end to rectify the graph's structure. The approach operates without prior knowledge of the attack's characteristics. We analytically derive a bound on the number of repetitions needed to satisfy probabilistic constraints on the quality of the reconstructed graph. The method can accurately and effectively decode Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs that were subjected to non-random edge removal, namely, those connected to vertices with the highest eigenvector centrality, in addition to random addition and removal of edges by the attacker. The method is also effective against attacks on large scale-free graphs generated using the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model but require a larger number of repetitions than needed to correct Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs.</description>
