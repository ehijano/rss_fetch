      <title>A Segmented Total Energy Detector (sTED) optimized for $(n,\gamma)$ cross-section measurements at n_TOF EAR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN is a spallation source dedicated to measurements of neutron-induced reaction cross-sections of interest in nuclear technologies, astrophysics, and other applications. Since 2014, Experimental ARea 2 (EAR2) is operational and delivers a neutron fluence of $4\times 10^7$ neutrons per nominal proton pulse, which is 50 times higher than the one of Experimental ARea 1 (EAR1) of $8\times10^5$ neutrons per pulse. The high neutron flux at EAR2 results in high counting rates in the detectors that challenged the previously existing capture detection systems. For this reason, a Segmented Total Energy Detector (sTED) has been developed to overcome the limitations in the detectors response, by reducing the active volume per module and by using a photomultiplier (PMT) optimized for high counting rates. This paper presents the main characteristics of the sTED, including energy and time resolution, response to $\gamma$-rays, and provides as well details of the use of the Pulse Height Weighting Technique (PHWT) with this detector. The sTED has been validated to perform neutron-capture cross-section measurements in EAR2 in the neutron energy range from thermal up to at least 400 keV. The detector has already been successfully used in several measurements at n_TOF EAR2.</description>

      <title>Water-based Quantum Dots Liquid Scintillator for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid scintillators are typically composed from organic compounds dissolved in organic solvents. However, usage of such material is often restricted due to fire safety and environmental reasons. Because of this, R\&amp;D of water-based liquid scintillators is of extreme relevance; yet, no such scintillators have been made commercially available as yet. Here, we investigate an alternative, water-based quantum dots liquid scintillator. Pre-determined and controllable optical properties of the quantum dots, as well as the existence of large libraries of established protocols for their dispersion in aqueous solutions, make them an attractive option for nuclear and particle physics applications. We characterize the optical properties of water-based quantum dots liquid scintillator and find that most of its optical properties are preserved upon quantum dots' phase transfer into water, through the addition of an oleic acid hydrophilic layer. Using the developed scintillator, the time and charge responses from atmospheric muons are measured, highlighting the practical viability of water-based quantum dots liquid scintillators for nuclear and particle physics, special interest on neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic lock-in detection and its optimisation for femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although often viewed as detrimental, fluctuations carry valuable information about the physical system from which they emerge. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) has recently been established to probe the ultrafast fluctuation dynamics of thermally populated magnons by measurement of their amplitude autocorrelation. Subharmonic lock-in detection is the key technique in this method, allowing to extract the pulse-to-pulse polarisation fluctuations of two femtosecond optical pulse trains transmitted through a magnetic sample. Here, we present a thorough technical description of the subharmonic demodulation technique and of the FemNoC measurement system. We mathematically model the data acquisition process and identify the essential parameters which critically influence the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals. Comparing the model calculations to real datasets allows validating the predicted parameter dependences and provides a means to optimise FemNoC experiments.</description>

      <title>Proton Beam Based Production of Positron Emitters by Exploiting the 27Al(p,x)22Na Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron annihilation experiments on an laboratory scale depend on the supply and the availability of $\beta^+$ emitters. Here we present the production of positron sources based on the $^{27}$Al(p,x)$^{22}$Na reaction by irradiation of Al with a 68\,MeV proton beam. We simulated the energy loss, range and radial scattering of the protons in Al in order to design a simple target consisting of a stack of Al discs. Our approach allows (i) the direct use of the Al discs as positron emitters that inherently avoids wet chemical processes as usually applied in commercial production of carrier-free $^{22}$Na, (ii) the production of multiple positron sources at once, and (iii) the simple measurement of the depth and lateral distribution of $^{22}$Na. We precisely determined the cross section of the $^{27}$Al(p,x)$^{22}$Na reaction which was found to differ from literature values particularly for proton energies between 27 and 40\,MeV. The activity of all nuclides produced (apart from $^{22}$Na) was shown to be negligible 15 days after irradiation. The production of radionuclides such as $^{48}$Sc, $^{54}$Mn and $^{56}$Co can be prevented by using Al of a higher purity. The concept presented here can easily be adapted for the production of stronger $^{22}$Na sources by increasing the proton current or/and the irradiation time.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Mitigating Dark Current Noise and Bad Pixels in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Cameras for Space-based Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the performance of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. These cameras have gained popularity as a viable alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras in a wide range of applications. One particular application is the CMOS camera installed in small space telescopes. However, the limited power and spatial resources available on satellites present challenges in maintaining ideal observation conditions, including temperature and radiation environment. Consequently, images captured by CMOS cameras are susceptible to issues such as dark current noise and defective pixels. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for mitigating dark current noise and bad pixels for CMOS cameras. Our approach involves two key steps: pixel clustering and function fitting. During pixel clustering step, we identify and group pixels exhibiting similar dark current noise properties. Subsequently, in the function fitting step, we formulate functions that capture the relationship between dark current and temperature, as dictated by the Arrhenius law. Our framework leverages ground-based test data to establish distinct temperature-dark current relations for pixels within different clusters. The cluster results could then be utilized to estimate the dark current noise level and detect bad pixels from real observational data. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted tests using real observation data obtained from the Yangwang-1 satellite, equipped with a near-ultraviolet telescope and an optical telescope. The results show a considerable improvement in the detection efficiency of space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Fast data-driven spectrometer with direct measurement of time and frequency for multiple single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-photon-sensitive spectrometer, based on a linear array of 512 single-photon avalanche diode detectors, with 0.04 nm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolutions. We employ a fast data-driven operation that allows direct measurement of time and frequency for simultaneous single photons, time- and frequency-stamping each single-photon detection. Our results combine excellent temporal and spectral resolution. We benchmark our result against the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle limit of hbar/2 for time and energy, and we are only a factor of 10 above it, despite the simplicity of our experimental setup, including room temperature operation. This work opens numerous applications in both classical and quantum photonics, especially when both spectral and temporal properties of single photons are exploited.</description>
