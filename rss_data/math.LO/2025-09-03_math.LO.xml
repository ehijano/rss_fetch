      <title>Toward higher-order infinite time Turing machines: simulational $\Gamma$-machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite time Turing machines (ITTMs) have been introduced by Hamkins and Lewis in their seminal article arXiv:math/9808093. The strength of the model comes from a limit rule which allows the ITTM to compute through ordinal stages. This rule is simple to describe and another rule would lead to a different model of ordinal computation. The aim of this article is to define a collection of limit rules for which the models of infinite Turing machine they induce have nice properties, akin to that of the ITTM. Through the analysis of the universal ITTM and of its preponderant role in the study of the ITTM, we devise a set of four constraints. A limit rule satisfying those constraints yields a model of infinite machine for which we can define a universal machine. Adding a fifth constraint, we show that any limit rule definable in set theory which meets those constraints produces a model of infinite machine with the desired properties. Among those, the fact that the supremum of the writable ordinal matches that of the clockable ordinal. That is, with the usual notations, the equality $\lambda = \gamma$ holds for any of those limit rules. Eventually, we provide a counter-example to show that the four first constraints alone are not sufficient.</description>

Abstract: We show that a set of non-negative reals is the distance set of a separable complete metric space if and only if it is either countable or is an analytic set which has 0 as a limit point. We also consider spaces with simpler distance sets.</description>

      <title>There may be an $n$-entangled set but no $n+1$-entangled sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that for every $2\leq n\in \mathbb{N}$, the statement "there is an $n$-entangled set, but there are no $n+1$-entangled sets" is consistent. We also prove some theorems which improve our understanding of entangled sets in relation to construction schemes: (1) The axiom FCA$^\Delta$ introduced in \cite{finitizationclubch} implies the existence of $n$-entangled sets which are not $n+1$-entangled. (2) $\mathfrak{m}_\mathcal{F}&gt;\omega_1$ implies the non-existence of entangled sets. Thus, $2$-capturing schemes alone are not sufficient to build these kinds of linear orders. (3) The existence of a 2-$\Delta$-capturing scheme is consistent with MA.</description>

      <title>Forcing Axioms and construction schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the development of the theory of construction schemes over $\omega_1$ as introduced by the third author by studying their relation with forcing axioms. Formally, we introduce the cardinals $\mathfrak{m}^n_{\mathcal{F}}$ and use the consistency of $\mathfrak{m}^2_\mathcal{F}&gt;\omega_1$ to prove a fundamental result relating gaps and almost disjoint families over $\omega$. The cardinals $\mathfrak{m}_\mathcal{F}$ are also used to prove some limiting results for contstruction schemes, some of which answer questions from \cite{schemescruz}. Finally, we show that PID implies the non-existence of $2$-capturing schemes.</description>

      <title>Flatness and Nonforking without the Continuum Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of FN bases (Frechet-Nikodym bases) without assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), refining results of Siu-Ah Ng concerning definability via flatness and nonforking. In particular, we examine the dependence of Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 of Ng's 1991 paper on CH, which guarantees the existence of nonforking primary heirs under specific ultrafilter conditions. We demonstrate that these properties can often be recovered in ZFC by analyzing the behavior of countably incomplete, good, and regular ultrafilters. By isolating model-theoretic conditions sufficient to replace CH, we establish that ultrapowers of flat FN bases satisfying Property B remain definable and nonforking. Connections are drawn to canonical bases, coheirs, and stability-theoretic ranks in superstable theories. Examples and counterexamples clarify the precise role of ultrafilter properties and reveal that the combinatorial essence of Ng's theory can be preserved within a purely ZFC framework.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is a Borel quasi-kernel in any locally countable Borel directed graph with finite Borel chromatic number. We prove that the Borel chromatic number of a Borel directed graph with bounded out-degree $n$ is either infinite or less than or equal to $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. This is an alternative proof of Palamourdas' theorem.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of positive characteristic with no algebraically closed subfield. Let $F$ be a function field over $K$ and $t \in F$ transcendental over $K$. Refining a result of Eisentr{\"a}ger and Shlapentokh, we show that there is no algorithm which, on input a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t][X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, determines whether $f$ has a zero in $F^n$. To this end, we revisit and partially extend several recent results from the literature on existential definability in function fields.</description>

      <title>Mekler's Construction and Murphy's Law for 2-Nilpotent Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on transfer of burden.</description>

      <title>Three Fundamental Questions in Modern Infinite-Domain Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Feder-Vardi dichotomy conjecture for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) with finite templates, confirmed independently by Bulatov and Zhuk, has an extension to certain well-behaved infinite templates due to Bodirsky and Pinsker which remains wide open. We provide answers to three fundamental questions on the scope of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture. Our first two main results provide two simplifications of this scope, one of structural, and the other one of algebraic nature. The former simplification implies that the conjecture is equivalent to its restriction to templates without algebraicity, a crucial assumption in the most powerful classification methods. The latter yields that the higher-arity invariants of any template within its scope can be assumed to be essentially injective, and any algebraic condition characterizing any complexity class within the conjecture closed under Datalog reductions must be satisfiable by injections, thus lifting the mystery of the better applicability of certain conditions over others. Our third main result uses the first one to show that any non-trivially tractable template within the scope serves, up to a Datalog-computable modification of it, as the witness of the tractability of a non-finitely tractable finite-domain Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) by the so-called sandwich method. This generalizes a recent result of Mottet and provides a strong hitherto unknown connection between the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture and finite-domain PCSPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of equivalence of generics filters started by Smythe in [Smy22]. We fully characterize those forcing posets for which the corresponding equivalence of generics is smooth using the purely topological property of condensation. Next we leverage our characterization to show that there are non-homogeneous forcing for which equivalence of generics is not smooth. Then we prove hyperfiniteness in the case of Prikry forcing and some additional results addressing the problem whether generic equivalence for Cohen forcing is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>

      <title>New inner models from second order logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new inner model C2(omega) based on the fragment of second order logic in which second order variables range over countable subsets of the domain. We compare C2(omega) to the previously studied inner model C(aa). We argue that C2(omega) appears to be a much bigger inner model than C(aa), although this cannot be literally true in ZFC alone. However, we conjecture that it follows from large cardinal assumptions. For example, assuming large cardinals, C2(omega) contains, for every n, an inner model with n Woodin cardinals, while C(aa) contains, under the same assumption, no inner model with a Woodin cardinal. As to large cardinals in C2(omega), we show that, assuming a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals, the cardinal omega_1 of V is Mahlo in C2(omega). A stronger result is proved for the combination C2(omega, aa) of C(aa) and C2(omega). We also show that the question whether HOD1, a variant of HOD, is the same as HOD cannot be decided on the basis of ZFC even if we add the assumption that there are supercompact cardinals.</description>

      <title>Continuous and algebraic domains in univalent foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and a model-theoretic independence relation on $\mathcal{D}$, we can lift that independence relation along $F$ to $\mathcal{C}$ by declaring a commuting square in $\mathcal{C}$ to be independent if its image under $F$ is independent. For each property that an independence relation can have we give assumptions on the functor that guarantee the property to be lifted.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>
