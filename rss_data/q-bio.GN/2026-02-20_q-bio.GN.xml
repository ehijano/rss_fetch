      <title>FUNGAR: a pipeline for detecting antifungal resistance mutations directly from metagenomic short reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Antifungal resistance has become an increasing global concern in both clinical and environmental health. Detecting known resistance mutations directly from sequencing reads, in special metagenomic samples, remains a major challenge. As fungal pathogens are often neglected compared with bacterial pathogens, most available tools are designed for bacterial taxa, whereas tools targeting fungi typically require assembled genomes. In metagenomic datasets, assembly-based strategies may result in substantial information loss due to genome fragmentation, low-abundance species, or incomplete recovery of resistance loci. Results: Here, we present FUNGAR, an open-source pipeline for the rapid identification of antifungal resistance genes and mutations directly from short-read data. FUNGAR employs translated alignments with DIAMOND and curated data from the FungAMR database to detect amino acid substitutions across all six open reading frames. The pipeline produces structured, reproducible reports linking detected variants to their associated antifungal drugs and can be easily customized for new species or databases.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Single-Cell Foundation Model Interpretability Reveals Attention Captures Co-Expression Rather Than Unique Regulatory Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation framework - thirty-seven analyses, 153 statistical tests, four cell types, two perturbation modalities - for assessing mechanistic interpretability in single-cell foundation models. Applying this framework to scGPT and Geneformer, we find that attention patterns encode structured biological information with layer-specific organisation - protein-protein interactions in early layers, transcriptional regulation in late layers - but this structure provides no incremental value for perturbation prediction: trivial gene-level baselines outperform both attention and correlation edges (AUROC 0.81-0.88 versus 0.70), pairwise edge scores add zero predictive contribution, and causal ablation of regulatory heads produces no degradation. These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal. Cell-State Stratified Interpretability (CSSI) addresses an attention-specific scaling failure, improving GRN recovery up to 1.85x. The framework establishes reusable quality-control standards for the field.</description>

      <title>JEPA-DNA: Grounding Genomic Foundation Models through Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Robust Machine Learning for Regulatory Sequence Modeling under Biological and Technical Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust machine learning for regulatory genomics is studied under biologically and technically induced distribution shifts. Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates.</description>
