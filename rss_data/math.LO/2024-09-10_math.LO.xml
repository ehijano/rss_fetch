      <title>Reflections on Russell's antinomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Russell's antinomy using three distinct deductive systems, which are then compared to deepen the logical deductions that lead to the contradiction. Some inferential paths are then presented, alternative to the commonly accepted one, that allow for the formal assertion of the antinomy without deriving the contradiction, thus preserving the coherence of the system. In light of this, the purpose of this article is to propose a review of the consequences of asserting Russell's antinomy and, by extension, the widespread belief that any attempt to resolve a paradox is doomed to failure.</description>

      <title>A classification of incompleteness statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For which choices of $X,Y,Z\in\{\Sigma^1_1,\Pi^1_1\}$ does no sufficiently strong $X$-sound and $Y$-definable extension theory prove its own $Z$-soundness? We give a complete answer, thereby delimiting the generalizations of G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem that hold within second-order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Deep Equilibria: Existence and Computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general concept of layered computation model, of which neural networks are a particular example, and combine tools of topological dynamics and model theory to study asymptotics of such models. We prove that, as the number of layers of a computation grows, the computation reaches a state of ``deep equilibrium" which amounts to a single, self-referential layer. After proving the existence of deep equilibria under fairly general hypotheses, we characterize their computability.</description>

      <title>Borel Order Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of Borel order dimension for Borel quasi orders. It will be shown that this notion is closely related to the notion of Borel dichromatic number for simple directed graphs. We prove a dichotomy, which generalizes the ${\GGG}_{0}$-dichotomy, for the Borel dichromatic number of Borel simple directed graphs. By applying this dichotomy to Borel quasi orders, another dichotomy that characterizes the Borel quasi orders of uncountable Borel dimension is proved. We obtain further structural information about the Borel quasi orders of countable Borel dimension by showing that they are all Borel linearizable. We then investigate the locally countable Borel quasi orders in more detail, paying special attention to the Turing degrees, and produce models of set theory where the continuum is arbitrarily large and all locally countable Borel quasi orders are of Borel dimension less than the continuum. Combining our results here with earlier work shows that the Borel order dimension of the Turing degrees is usually strictly larger than its classical order dimension.</description>

      <title>The proper forcing axiom for $\aleph_1$-sized posets, P\v{r}\'{i}kr\'{y}-type proper forcing, and the size of the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Proper Forcing Axiom for forcing notions of size $\aleph_1$ is consistent with the continuum being arbitrarily large. In fact, assuming $GCH$ holds and $\kappa\geq\omega_2$ is a regular cardinal, we prove that there is a proper and $\aleph_2$-c.c.\ forcing $\mathbb{P}$ giving rise to a model of this forcing axiom together with $2^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$ and which, in addition, satisfies all statements of the form $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)\models \forall x\exists y\varphi(x, y)$, where $\varphi(x, y)$ is a restricted formula with the property that for every $a\in \mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)$ and every inner model $M$ of $CH$ with $a\in M$ there is, in $M$, a suitably nice proper poset adding some $b$ such that $\varphi(a, b)$. In particular, $\mathbb{P}$ forces Moore's Measuring principle, Baumgartner's Axiom for $\aleph_1$-dense sets of reals, Todor\v{c}evi\'{c}'s Open Colouring Axiom for sets of size $\aleph_1$, and Todor\v{e}vi\'{c}'s P-ideal Dichotomy for $\aleph_1$-generated ideals on $\omega_1$, among other statements. In particular, all these statements are simultaneously compatible with a large continuum.</description>
