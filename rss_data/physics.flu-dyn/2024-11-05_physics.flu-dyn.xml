      <title>Advanced Theoretical Analysis of Stability and Convergence in Computational Fluid Dynamics for Computer Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling of fluid dynamics for computer graphics requires high levels of theoretical rigor to ensure visually plausible and computationally efficient simulations. This paper presents an in-depth theoretical framework analyzing the mathematical properties, such as stability, convergence, and error bounds, of numerical schemes used in fluid simulation. Conditions for stability in semi-Lagrangian and particle-based methods were derived, demonstrating that these methods remain stable under certain conditions. Furthermore, convergence rates for Navier-Stokes discretizations were obtained, showing that numerical solutions converge to analytical solutions as spatial resolution and time step decrease. Furthermore, new theoretical results were introduced on the maintenance of incompressibility and conservation of vorticity, which are crucial for the physical accuracy of simulations. The findings serve as a mathematical foundation for future research in adaptive fluid simulation, guiding the development of robust simulation techniques for real-time graphics applications.</description>

      <title>Upstroke wing clapping in bats and bat-inspired robots improves both lift generation and power economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wing articulation is critical for efficient flight of bird- and bat-sized animals. Inspired by the flight of $\textit{Cynopterus brachyotis}$, the lesser short-nosed fruit bat, we built a two-degree-of-freedom flapping wing platform with variable wing folding capability. In late upstroke, the wings "clap" and produce an air jet that significantly increases lift production, with a positive peak matched to that produced in downstroke. Though ventral clapping has been observed in avian flight, potential aerodynamic benefit of this behavior has yet to be rigorously assessed. We used multiple approaches -- quasi-steady modeling, direct force/power measurement, and PIV experiments in a wind tunnel -- to understand critical aspects of lift/power variation in relation to wing folding magnitude over Strouhal numbers between $St = 0.2 - 0.4$. While lift increases monotonically with folding amplitude in that range, power economy (ratio of lift/power) is more nuanced. At $St = 0.2 - 0.3$, it increase with wing folding amplitude monotonically. At $St = 0.3 - 0.4$, it features two maxima -- one at medium folding amplitude ($\sim 30^\circ$), and the other at maximum folding. These findings illuminate two strategies available to flapping wing animals and robots -- symmetry-breaking lift augmentation and appendage-based jet propulsion.</description>

      <title>The drag length is key to quantifying tree canopy drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of trees on urban flows are often determined using computational fluid dynamics approaches which typically use a quadratic drag formulation based on the leaf-area density $a$ and a volumetric drag coefficient $C_{d}^V$ to model vegetation. In this paper, we develop an analytical model for the flow within a vegetation canopy and identify that the drag length $\ell_d = (a C_d^V)^{-1}$ is the key metric to describe the local tree drag characteristics. A detailed study of the literature suggests that the median $\ell_d$ observed in field experiments is $21$ m for trees and $0.7$ m for low vegetation (crops). A total of $168$ large-eddy simulations are conducted to obtain a closed form of the analytical model. The model allows determining $a$ and $C_d^V$ from wind-tunnel experiments that typically present the drag characteristics in terms of the classical drag coefficient $C_d$ and the aerodynamic porosity $\alpha_L$. We show that geometric scaling of $\ell_d$ is the appropriate scaling of trees in wind tunnels. Evaluation of $\ell_d$ for numerical simulations and wind-tunnel experiments (assuming geometric scaling $1:100$) in literature shows that the median $\ell_d$ in both these cases is about $5$ m, suggesting possible overestimation of vegetative drag.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 3D numerical modeling of granular cargo movement on bulk carriers in waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel monolithic approach for simulating vessels in waves with granular cargo is presented using a Finite Volume framework. This model integrates a three-phase Volume of Fluid method to represent air, water, and cargo, coupled with a granular material model. The approach incorporates vessel dynamics by assuming rigid-body motion for the vessel's empty hull. A three degrees of freedom rigid-body motion solver is applied for a 3D case study. The model also includes inviscid far-field boundary conditions facilitating the generation of linear waves approaching the vessel and applies a rigid-perfectly plastic material model for the granular phase. The model's efficacy is demonstrated through a validation of the three-phase Volume of the Fluid method, a verification of the granular material model, and finally, a reconstruction of the "Jian Fu Star" incident in a fully 3D simulation. This integrated approach is a feasibility study for investigating bulk carrier accidents, offering a powerful tool for maritime safety analysis and design optimization.</description>

      <title>Prediction of three-dimensional chemically reacting compressible turbulence based on implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate and fast prediction of long-term dynamics of turbulence presents a significant challenge for both traditional numerical simulations and machine learning methods. In recent years, the emergence of neural operators has provided a promising approach to address this issue. The implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IU-FNO) has successfully demonstrated long-term stable predictions for three-dimensional incompressible turbulence. In this study, we extend this method to the three-dimensional chemically reacting compressible turbulence. Numerical results show that the IU-FNO model predicts flow dynamics significantly faster than the traditional dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) used in large eddy simulation (LES). In terms of prediction accuracy, the IU-FNO framework outperforms the traditional DSM in predicting the energy spectra of velocity, temperature, and density, the probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity and velocity increments, and instantaneous spatial structures of temperature. Therefore, the IU-FNO represents a highly promising approach for predicting chemically reacting compressible turbulence.</description>

      <title>The instability of a membrane enclosed by two viscous fluids with a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the stability of a flexible material interface between two fluids of the same viscosity in interaction with a free surface. When the layers are motionless, we provide evidence for the onset of a novel instability by means of analytical and numerical solution of the associated boundary value problem in the region stable against Rayleigh--Taylor instability, i.e. when the acceleration due to gravity acts from the lighter to the heavier fluid. This destabilisation phenomenon is attributed to the non-conservative tangential forces acting at the interface and the fluid-structure interaction. Furthermore, we examine the scenario in which an external forcing mechanism induces a monotonic parallel shear flow within the upper layer. In addition to the long-established inflectional instability predicted in the inviscid limit, we demonstrate the existence of membrane flutter in the absence of density stratification. The latter is either due to an over-reflection process of surface gravity waves or to the growth of Tollmien--Schlichting waves, as outlined in the context of boundary-layer theory. This fluid-structure configuration represents a paradigmatic model for investigating the interplay between inflectional, radiation-induced and shear-induced instabilities. It also serves as a viscous counterpart to the classical Kelvin--Helmholtz instability when layers with distinct densities are assumed.</description>

      <title>Neural optical flow for planar and stereo PIV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural optical flow (NOF) offers improved accuracy and robustness over existing OF methods for particle image velocimetry (PIV). Unlike other OF techniques, which rely on discrete displacement fields, NOF parameterizes the physical velocity field using a continuous neural-implicit representation. This formulation enables efficient data assimilation and ensures consistent regularization across views for stereo PIV. The neural-implicit architecture provides significant data compression and supports a space-time formulation, facilitating the analysis of both steady and unsteady flows. NOF incorporates a differentiable, nonlinear image-warping operator that relates particle motion to intensity changes between frames. Discrepancies between the advected intensity field and observed images form the data loss, while soft constraints, such as Navier-Stokes residuals, enhance accuracy and enable direct pressure inference from PIV images. Additionally, mass continuity can be imposed as a hard constraint for both 2D and 3D flows. Implicit regularization is achieved by tailoring the network's expressivity to match a target flow's spectral characteristics. Results from synthetic planar and stereo PIV datasets, as well as experimental planar data, demonstrate NOF's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art wavelet-based OF and CC methods. Additionally, we highlight its potential broader applicability to techniques like background-oriented schlieren, molecular tagging velocimetry, and other advanced measurement systems.</description>

      <title>Duality of the Navier-Stokes dynamics and lack of finite-time explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>

      <title>On the effect of two-direction seasonal flows on barchans and the origin of occluded dunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We inquire into the morphodynamics of barchans under seasonal flows. For that, we carried out grain-scale numerical computations of a subaqueous barchan exposed to two-directional flows, and we varied the angle and frequency of oscillations. We show that when the frequency is lower than the inverse of the characteristic time for barchan formation, the dune adapts to the new flow direction and recovers the barchan shape while losing less grains than under one-directional flow. For higher frequencies, the dune has not enough time for adaptation and becomes more round while losing more grains. For both cases, we show, for the first time, the typical dynamics of grains (trajectories and forces). In particular, the round barchans are similar to the so-called occluded dunes observed on Mars, where seasons have very high frequencies compared to the dune timescale, different from Earth. Our results represent a possible explanation for that shape.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasigeostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical physical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable $\textrm{ -- }$ potential vorticity (PV) $\textrm{ -- }$ is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are "balanced". For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulation of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ shows that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts. We propose here that SWQG$^{+1}$ could be a useful intermediate model for theoretical and numerical study of the balanced dynamics of geophysical physical fluid dynamics, with possible applications for forward and inverse modeling of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and other planets.</description>

      <title>Direct Calculation of the Eddy Viscosity Operator in Turbulent Channel Flow at Re$_\tau$=180</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to quantify how turbulence in a channel flow mixes momentum in the mean sense. We applied the macroscopic forcing method (Mani and Park, Physical Review Fluids, 2021, p.054607) to direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow at Re_tau=180 using two different forcing strategies that are designed to separately assess the anisotropy and nonlocality of momentum mixing. In the first strategy, the leading term of the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the eddy viscosity is quantified, revealing all 81 tensorial coefficients that essentially characterize the local-limit eddy viscosity. The results indicate: (1) the eddy viscosity has significant anisotropy, (2) Reynolds stresses are generated by both the mean strain rate and mean rotation rate tensors associated with the momentum field, and (3) the local-limit eddy viscosity generates asymmetric Reynolds stress tensors. In the second strategy, the eddy viscosity is quantified as an integration kernel revealing the nonlocal influence of the mean momentum gradient at each wall-normal coordinate on all nine components of the Reynolds stresses over the channel width. Our results indicate that while the shear component of the Reynolds stress is reasonably controlled by the local mean gradients, other components of the Reynolds stress are highly nonlocal. These results provide an understanding of anisotropy and nonlocality requirements for closure modeling of momentum transport in wall-bounded turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Prediction of turbulent channel flow using Fourier neural operator-based machine-learning strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of turbulent flows are of great importance in the science and engineering field. In this paper, we investigate the implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) in the stable prediction of long-time dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent channel flows. The trained IUFNO models are tested in the large-eddy simulations (LES) at coarse grids for three friction Reynolds numbers: $Re_{\tau}\approx180$, $395$ and $590$. The adopted near-wall mesh grids are tangibly coarser than the general requirements for wall-resolved LES. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO), the implicit FNO (IFNO) and U-Net enhanced FNO (UFNO), the IUFNO model has a much better long-term predictive ability. The numerical experiments show that the IUFNO framework outperforms the traditional dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of a variety of flow statistics and structures, including the mean and fluctuating velocities, the probability density functions (PDFs) and joint PDF of velocity fluctuations, the Reynolds stress profile, the kinetic energy spectrum, and the Q-criterion (vortex structures). Meanwhile, the trained IUFNO models are computationally much faster than the traditional LES models. Thus, the IUFNO model is a promising approach for the fast prediction of wall-bounded turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Analytical prediction for the steady-state behavior of a confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady-state behavior of a single drop under shear flow has been extensively investigated in the limit of small deformation and negligible inertia effects. In this work, we combine the calculations proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity, with those by Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. By merging these two approaches, we provide comprehensive analytical predictions for steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle across a wide range of physical conditions, from confined to unconfined droplets, including or excluding the effect of interface viscosity. The proposed analytical predictions are also robust concerning variations in the viscosity ratio, making our model general enough to include any of the above conditions.</description>

      <title>Modular and Extendable 1D-Simulation for Microfluidic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices have been the subject of considerable attention in recent years. The development of novel microfluidic devices, their evaluation, and their validation requires simulations. While common methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be time-consuming, 1D simulation provides an appealing alternative that leads to efficient results with reasonable quality. Current 1D simulation tools cover specific microfluidic applications; however, these tools are still rare and not widely adopted. There is a need for a more versatile and adaptable tool that covers novel applications, like mixing and the addition of membranes, and allows easy extension, resulting in one comprehensive 1D simulation tool for microfluidic devices. In this work, we present an open-source, modular, and extendable 1D simulation approach for microfluidic devices, which is available as an open-source software package at https://github.com/cda-tum/mmft-modular-1D-simulator. To this end, we propose an implementation that consists of a base module (providing the core functionality) that can be extended with dedicated application-specific modules (providing dedicated support for common microfluidic applications such as mixing, droplets, membranes, etc.).

      <title>Water Drop on Thin Viscous Oil Layers: From Stick-Slip Spreading to Dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13191</link>

Abstract: The impact of water droplets on thin layers of immiscible viscous liquids, such as oil films, is commonly encountered across contexts ranging from kitchen activities to industrial processes. In this study, we experimentally investigate the short-term and long-term behavior of water drops spreading on silicone oil-coated surfaces. During the initial spreading, especially towards zero impact energies, the drop edge exhibits stick-slip dynamics, characterized by intermittent stops. The stick-slip behaviour diminishes with increasing spreading energy from impacts, where the drop spreads without noticeably displacing the oil layer. In the long-term dynamics, regardless of whether the spreading is gradual or impact-driven, the drop eventually spreads onto the surface under the oil layer, governed by the dewetting dynamics of the oil. The delay for the second spreading is independent of the Weber number, indicating that the impact initially does not significantly deform the oil layer. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of water-oil interactions, with implications for both practical applications and fundamental research.</description>

      <title>A theoretical model for compressible bubble dynamics considering phase transition and migration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel theoretical model for bubble dynamics is established that simultaneously accounts for the liquid compressibility, phase transition, oscillation, migration, ambient flow field, etc. The bubble dynamics equations are presented in a unified and concise mathematical form with clear physical meanings and extensibility. The bubble oscillation equation can be simplified to the Keller-Miksis equation by neglecting the effects of phase transition and bubble migration. The present theoretical model effectively captures the experimental results for bubbles generated in free fields, near free surfaces, adjacent to rigid walls, and in the vicinity of other bubbles. Based on the present theory, we explore the effect of the bubble content by changing the vapor proportion inside the cavitation bubble for an initial high-pressure bubble. It is found that the energy loss of the bubble shows a consistent increase with increasing Mach number and initial vapor proportion. However, the radiated pressure peak by the bubble at the collapse stage increases with the decreasing Mach number and increasing vapor proportion. The energy analyses of the bubble reveal that the presence of vapor inside the bubble not only directly contributes to the energy loss of the bubble through phase transition but also intensifies the bubble collapse, which leads to greater radiation of energy into the surrounding flow field due to the fluid compressibility.</description>

      <title>Classically studied coherent structures only paint a partial picture of wall-bounded turbulence</title>

Abstract: For the last 140 years, the mechanisms of transport and dissipation of energy in a turbulent flow have not been completely understood due to the complexity of this phenomenon. The dissipation of energy due to turbulence is significative, and understanding turbulence physics is crucial for fighting the present climate emergency. Previous research has focused on analyzing the so-called coherent structures of the flow (Q events, streaks, and vortices), which are regions of high turbulence transport, high/low streamwise fluctuation, and rotation, respectively. However, the connection between these classically studied structures and the flow development is still uncertain. To fill this gap, here we show a data-driven methodology for objectively identifying high-importance regions in a turbulent flow. A deep-learning model is trained to predict a future state of a turbulent channel flow and the gradient-SHAP explainability algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each grid point for such a prediction. Finally, high-importance regions are computed using the SHAP data, analyzing and comparing their characteristics with those of the other coherent structures. The SHAP analysis provides an objective way to identify the regions of highest importance in the turbulent flow, which exhibit different levels of agreement with the classically studied structures.</description>

      <title>Large traveling capillary-gravity waves for Darcy flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study capillary-gravity and capillary surface waves for fluid flows governed by Darcy's law. This includes flows in vertical Hele-Shaw cells and in porous media (the one-phase Muskat problem) with finite or infinite depth. The free boundary is acted upon by an external pressure posited to be in traveling wave form with an arbitrary periodic profile and an amplitude parameter. For any given wave speed, we first prove that there exists a unique local curve of small periodic traveling waves corresponding to small values of the parameter. Then we prove that as the parameter increases but could possibly be bounded, the curve belongs to a connected set $\mathcal{C}$ of traveling waves. The set $\mathcal{C}$ contains traveling waves that either have arbitrarily large gradients or are arbitrarily close to the rigid bottom in the finite depth case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of large traveling surface waves for a viscous free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation for the POD formulation of the parametric laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>

Abstract: A posteriori reduced-order models (ROM), e.g. based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), are essential to affordably tackle realistic parametric problems. They rely on a trustful training set, that is a family of full-order solutions (snapshots) representative of all possible outcomes of the parametric problem. Having such a rich collection of snapshots is not, in many cases, computationally viable. A strategy for data augmentation, designed for parametric laminar incompressible flows, is proposed to enrich poorly populated training sets. The goal is to include in the new, artificial snapshots emerging features, not present in the original basis, that do enhance the quality of the reduced basis (RB) constructed using POD dimensionality reduction. The methodologies devised are based on exploiting basic physical principles, such as mass and momentum conservation, to construct physically-relevant, artificial snapshots at a fraction of the cost of additional full-order solutions. Interestingly, the numerical results show that the ideas exploiting only mass conservation (i.e., incompressibility) are not producing significant added value with respect to the standard linear combinations of snapshots. Conversely, accounting for the linearized momentum balance via the Oseen equation does improve the quality of the resulting approximation and therefore is an effective data augmentation strategy in the framework of viscous incompressible laminar flows. Numerical experiments of parametric flow problems, in two and three dimensions, at low and moderate values of the Reynolds number are presented to showcase the superior performance of the data-enriched POD-RB with respect to the standard ROM in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction</title>

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for fluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.

      <title>Spatially-Aware Diffusion Models with Cross-Attention for Global Field Reconstruction with Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their ability to represent complex distributions and incorporate uncertainty, making them ideal for robust predictions in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</description>
