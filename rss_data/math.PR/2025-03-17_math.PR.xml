      <title>The fast rate of convergence of the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating a $d$-dimensional distribution $\mu$ by the empirical measure $\hat{\mu}_n$ of its samples is an important task in probability theory, statistics and machine learning. It is well known that $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{W}_p(\hat{\mu}_n, \mu)]\lesssim n^{-1/d}$ for $d&gt;2p$, where $\mathcal{W}_p$ denotes the $p$-Wasserstein metric. An effective tool to combat this curse of dimensionality is the smooth Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}^{(\sigma)}_p$, which measures the distance between two probability measures after having convolved them with isotropic Gaussian noise $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2\text{I})$. In this paper we apply this smoothing technique to the adapted Wasserstein distance. We show that the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$ achieves the fast rate of convergence $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p^{(\sigma)}(\hat{\mu}_n, \mu)]\lesssim n^{-1/2}$, if $\mu$ is subgaussian. This result follows from the surprising fact, that any subgaussian measure $\mu$ convolved with a Gaussian distribution has locally Lipschitz kernels.</description>

      <title>Processes on Wasserstein spaces and energy-minimizing particle representations in fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a probability-measure-valued process $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide almost surely with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy in expectation. Building on our recent study (arXiv:2502.12068), where the minimization of fractional Sobolev energy was investigated for deterministic paths on Wasserstein spaces, we now extend the results to the stochastic setting to address some applications that originally motivated our study. Two applications are given. We construct minimizing particle representations for processes on Wasserstein spaces on $\mathbb{R}$ with H\"{o}lder regularity, using optimal transportation. We prove the existence of minimizing particle representations for solutions to stochastic Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations on $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{d}$ satisfying an integrability condition, using the stochastic superposition principle of Lacker--Shkolnikov--Zhang (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 25, 3229--3288 (2023)).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations as smooth Hilbertian gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under suitable assumptions on $\beta:\mathbb{R}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}, \,D:\mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^d$ and $b:\mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}$, the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation $u_t-\Delta\beta(u)+{\rm div}(Db(u)u)=0$, in $(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d$ where $D=-\nabla\Phi$, can be identified as a smooth gradient flow $\frac{d^+}{dt}\,u(t)+\nabla E_{u(t)}=0$, $\forall t&gt;0$. Here, $E:\mathcal{P}^*\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)\to\mathbb{R}$ is the energy function associated to the equation, where $\mathcal{P}^*$ is a certain convex subset of the space of probability densities. $\mathcal{P}^*$ is invariant under the flow and $\nabla E_u$ is the gradient of $E$, that is, the tangent vector field to $\mathcal{P}$ at $u$ defined by $\left&lt;\nabla E_u,z_u\right&gt;_u={\rm diff}\,E_u\cdot z_u$ for all vector fields $z_u$ on $\mathcal{P}^*$, where $\left&lt;\cdot,\cdot\right&gt;_u$ is a scalar product on a suitable tangent space $\mathcal{T}_u(\mathcal{P}^*)\subset\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Tail behavior of randomly weighted sums with interdependent summands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider a classical, well-studied problem from applied probability. This is the max-sum equivalence of randomly weighted sums, and the originality is because we manage to include interdependence among the primary random variables, as well as among primary random variables and random weights, as a generalization of previously published results. As a consequence we provide the finite-time ruin probability, in a discrete-time risk model. Furthermore, we established asymptotic bounds for the generalized moments of randomly weighted sums in the case of dominatedly varying primary random variables under the same dependence conditions. Finally, we give some results for randomly weighted and stopped sums under similar dependence conditions, with the restriction that the random weights are identically distributed, and the same holds for the primary random variables. Additionally, under these assumptions, we find asymptotic expressions for the random time ruin probability, in a discete-time risk model.</description>

      <title>On the localization length of finite-volume random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs) in dimensions 1 and 2, which naturally extend the Anderson model by replacing the random potential with a random block potential. Specifically, we focus on two RBSOs -- the block Anderson and Wegner orbital models -- defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. They take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a block potential with i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ Gaussian diagonal blocks, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We normalize the blocks of $\Psi$ so that each block has a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the same order as the blocks of $V$. Assuming $W\ge L^\delta$ for a small constant $\delta&gt;0$ and $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish the following results. In dimension $d=2$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors, which, combined with the localization result from arXiv:1608.02922 under the condition $\lambda\ll W^{-d/2}$, rigorously establishes the Anderson localization-delocalization transition as $\lambda$ crosses the critical threshold $W^{-d/2}$. In dimension $d=1$, we show that the localization length of bulk eigenvectors is at least of order $(W\lambda)^2$, which is conjectured to be the correct scaling for the localization length.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Random Geometric Graphs in High and Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT) to study the distribution of random geometric graphs (RGGs) on the cube and torus in the high-dimensional limit. We find that the distribution of RGGs on the torus converges to the Erd\H os-Reny\' i ensemble, but the distribution for RGGs on the cube is different. It has a lower maximum entropy, but is still symmetric. An Edgeworth correction to the CLT is then developed to derive the $\mathcal{O}\left(d^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ scaling of Shannon entropy of RGGs in dimension. We also provide numerical approximations of maximum entropy in low-dimensional hard and soft RGGs, and calculate exactly the entropy of hard RGGs with 3 nodes in the one-dimensional cube and torus.</description>

      <title>Quadratic BSDEs with Singular Generators and Unbounded Terminal Conditions: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with generators singular in $ y $. First, we establish the existence of solutions and a comparison theorem, thereby extending results in the literature. Additionally, we analyze the stability property and the Feynman-Kac formula, and prove the uniqueness of viscosity solutions for the corresponding singular semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Finally, we demonstrate applications in the context of robust control linked to stochastic differential utility and certainty equivalent based on $g$-expectation. In these applications, the coefficient of the quadratic term in the generator captures the level of ambiguity aversion and the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, respectively.</description>

      <title>Existence of critical tiltings and local limits of general size-conditioned Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson multitype trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the structure of multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (BGW) trees conditioned on integer linear combinations of the numbers of vertices of given types. We show that, under regularity assumptions on the offspring distributions, it is always possible to find a critical BGW tree having the same conditional distribution. This allows us to prove the existence of local limits for noncritical BGW trees, under a large variety of conditionings. Our proof is based on geometric considerations on the set of the so-called exponential tiltings of a family of offspring distributions.</description>

      <title>Functional central limit theorem for the subgraph count of the voter model on dynamic random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two-opinion voter models on dynamic random graphs, in which the joint dynamics of opinions and graphs acts as one-way feedback, i.e., edges appear and disappear over time depending on the opinions of the two connected vertices, while the opinion dynamics does not depend on the edge process. Our goal is to investigate the joint evolution of the entries of a voter subgraph count vector, i.e., vector of subgraphs where each vertex has a specific opinion, in the regime that the number of vertices grows large. The main result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem. In particular, we prove that, under a proper centering and scaling, the joint functional of the vector of subgraph counts converges to a specific multidimensional Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Numerical and statistical analysis of NeuralODE with Runge-Kutta time integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NeuralODE is one example for generative machine learning based on the push forward of a simple source measure with a bijective mapping, which in the case of NeuralODE is given by the flow of a ordinary differential equation. Using Liouville's formula, the log-density of the push forward measure is easy to compute and thus NeuralODE can be trained based on the maximum Likelihood method such that the Kulback-Leibler divergence between the push forward through the flow map and the target measure generating the data becomes small. In this work, we give a detailed account on the consistency of Maximum Likelihood based empirical risk minimization for a generic class of target measures. In contrast to prior work, we do not only consider the statistical learning theory, but also give a detailed numerical analysis of the NeuralODE algorithm based on the 2nd order Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration. Using the universal approximation theory for deep ReQU networks, the stability and convergence rated for the RK scheme as well as metric entropy and concentration inequalities, we are able to prove that NeuralODE is a probably approximately correct (PAC) learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which then induce constraints on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), it has received little attention in philosophy. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist) and arguing for its advantages. In particular, I develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that treats the convergence of posterior credences to the truth as a fundamental rather than derived normative requirement. This approach, called convergentist Bayesianism, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor and related inference methods in statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Non-Parametric Model Learning and Adaptive Control of MDPs with Borel spaces: Identifiability and Near Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an average cost stochastic control problem with standard Borel spaces and an unknown transition kernel. We do not assume a parametric structure on the unknown kernel. We present topologies on kernels which lead to their identifiability and ensures near optimality through robustness to identifiability errors. Following this, we present two data-driven identifiability results; the first one being Bayesian (with finite time convergence guarantees) and the second one empirical (with asymptotic convergence guarantees). The identifiability results are, then, used to design near-optimal adaptive control policies which alternate between periods of exploration, where the agent attempts to learn the true kernel, and periods of exploitation where the knowledge accrued throughout the exploration phase is used to minimize costs. We will establish that such policies are near optimal. Moreover, we will show that near optimality can also be achieved through policies that simultaneously explore and exploit the environment. Thus, our primary contributions are to present very general conditions ensuring identifiability, as well as adaptive learning and control which leads to optimality. Key tools facilitating our analysis are a general measurability theorem, robustness to model learning, and continuity of expected average cost in stationary policies under Young topology.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Total Variation Distance between Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total variation distance is a metric of central importance in statistics and probability theory. However, somewhat surprisingly, questions about computing it algorithmically appear not to have been systematically studied until very recently. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by studying this question in the important special case of multivariate Gaussians. More formally, we consider the problem of approximating the total variation distance between two multivariate Gaussians to within an $\epsilon$-relative error. Previous works achieved a fixed constant relative error approximation via closed-form formulas. In this work, we give algorithms that given any two $n$-dimensional Gaussians $D_1,D_2$, and any error bound $\epsilon &gt; 0$, approximate the total variation distance $D := d_{TV}(D_1,D_2)$ to $\epsilon$-relative accuracy in $\text{poly}(n,\frac{1}{\epsilon},\log \frac{1}{D})$ operations. The main technical tool in our work is a reduction that helps us extend the recent progress on computing the TV-distance between discrete random variables to our continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Quantization dimension for a generalized inhomogeneous bi-Lipschitz iterated function system</title>

Abstract: For a given $r\in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, of a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$ represents the speed how fast the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exists, we call $\underline D_r(\mu)$ and $\overline D_r(\mu)$, the lower and upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$. In this paper, we estimate the quantization dimension of condensation measures associated with condensation systems $(\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N, (p_i)_{i=0}^N, \nu)$, where the mappings $f_i$ are bi-Lipschitz and the measure $\nu$ is an image measure of an ergodic measure with bounded distortion supported on a conformal set. In addition, we determine the optimal quantization for an infinite discrete distribution, and give an example which shows that the quantization dimension of a Borel probability measure can be positive with zero quantization coefficient.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on Jacobi structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jacobi structures are known to generalize Poisson structures, encompassing symplectic, cosymplectic, and Lie-Poisson manifolds. Notably, other intriguing geometric structures -- such as contact and locally conformal symplectic manifolds -- also admit Jacobi structures but do not belong to the Poisson category. In this paper, we employ global stochastic analysis techniques, initially developed by Meyer and Schwartz, to rigorously introduce stochastic Hamiltonian systems on Jacobi manifolds. We then propose a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) framework as an alternative perspective on the underlying dynamics. We emphasize that many of our results extend the work of Bismut [Bis80, Bis81] and L\'azaro-Cam\'i \&amp; Ortega [LCO08, LCO09]. Furthermore, aspects of our geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory in the stochastic setting draw inspiration from the deterministic contributions of Abraham \&amp; Marsden [AM78], de Le\'on \&amp; Sard\'on [dLS17], Esen et al. [EdLSZ21], and related literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a sequence of $d$-regular graphs $(G_d)_{d\in \mathbb{N}}$ and denote by $G_{d,p}$ the graph obtained from $G_d$ after edge-percolation with probability $p=c/d$, for a constant $c&gt;0$. We prove a quantitative local convergence of $(G_{d,p})_{d\in \mathbb{N}}$. In combination with results of Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez, it implies that the rescaled matching number of $G_{d,p}$ is asymptotically equivalent to that of the binomial random graph $G(n,c/n)$.</description>

      <title>On continuity of Chatterjee's rank correlation and related dependence measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While measures of concordance -- such as Spearman's rho, Kendall's tau, and Blomqvist's beta -- are continuous with respect to weak convergence, Chatterjee's rank correlation xi recently introduced in Azadkia and Chatterjee [5] does not share this property, causing drawbacks in statistical inference as pointed out in B\"ucher and Dette [7]. As we study in this paper, xi is instead weakly continuous with respect to conditionally independent copies -- the Markov products. To establish weak continuity of Markov products, we provide several sufficient conditions, including copula-based criteria and conditions relying on the concept of conditional weak convergence in Sweeting [36]. As a consequence, we also obtain continuity results for xi and related dependence measures and verify their continuity in the parameters of standard models such as multivariate elliptical and l1-norm symmetric distributions.</description>

      <title>Effective Soliton Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these solitons, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of soliton locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards practical PDMP sampling: Metropolis adjustments, locally adaptive step-sizes, and NUTS-based time lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) hold significant promise for sampling from complex probability distributions. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the need to compute model-specific bounds. Conversely, while Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) offers a generally efficient approach to sampling, its inability to adaptively tune step sizes impedes its performance when sampling complex distributions like funnels.
  To address these limitations, we introduce three innovative concepts: (a) a Metropolis-adjusted approximation for PDMP simulation that eliminates the need for explicit bounds without compromising the invariant measure, (b) an adaptive step size mechanism compatible with the Metropolis correction, and (c) a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)-inspired scheme for dynamically selecting path lengths in PDMPs. These three ideas can be seamlessly integrated into a single, `doubly-adaptive' PDMP sampler with favourable robustness and efficiency properties.</description>

      <title>Towards Markov-State Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</description>

      <title>A dual process for the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.02668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion is a multi-dimensional Wright-Fisher diffusion for multi-locus and multi-allelic genetic frequencies, expressed as the strong solution to a system of stochastic differential equations that are coupled in the drift, where the pairwise interaction among loci is modelled by an inter-locus selection. In this paper, an ancestral process, which is dual to the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion, is derived. The dual process corresponds to the block counting process of coupled ancestral selection graphs, one for each locus. Jumps of the dual process arise from coalescence, mutation, single-branching, which occur at one locus at the time, and double-branching, which occur simultaneously at two loci. The coalescence and mutation rates have the typical structure of the transition rates of the Kingman coalescent process. The single-branching rate not only contains the one-locus selection parameters in a form that generalises the rates of an ancestral selection graph, but it also contains the two-locus selection parameters to include the effect of the pairwise interaction on the single loci. The double-branching rate reflects the particular structure of pairwise selection interactions of the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion. Moreover, in the special case of two loci, two alleles, with selection and parent independent mutation, the stationary density for the coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion and the transition rates of the dual process are obtained in an explicit form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kingman coalescent is a fundamental process in population genetics modelling the ancestry of a sample of individuals backwards in time. In this paper, in a large-sample-size regime, we study asymptotic properties of the coalescent under neutrality and a general finite-alleles mutation scheme, i.e. including both parent independent and parent dependent mutation. In particular, we consider a sequence of Markov chains that is related to the coalescent and consists of block-counting and mutation-counting components. We show that these components, suitably scaled, converge weakly to deterministic components and Poisson processes with varying intensities, respectively. Along the way, we develop a novel approach, based on a change of measure, to generalise the convergence result from the parent independent to the parent dependent mutation setting, in which several crucial quantities are not known explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an injective martingale coupling; in particular, given measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ in convex order on $\mathbb R$ such that $\nu$ is continuous, we construct a martingale transport such that for each $y$ in the support of the target law $\nu$ there is a {\em unique} $x$ in {a support of} the initial law $\mu$ such that (some of) the mass at $x$ is transported to $y$. Then $\pi$ has disintegration $\pi(dx,dy) = \nu(dy) \delta_{\theta(y)}(dx)$ for some function $\theta$.
  More precisely we construct a martingale coupling $\pi$ of the measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ such that there is a set $\Gamma_\mu$ such that $\mu(\Gamma_\mu)=1$ and a disintegration $(\pi_x)_{x \in \Gamma_\mu}$ of $\pi$ of the form $\pi(dx,dy) = \pi_x(dy) \mu(dx)$ such that, with $\Gamma_{\pi_x}$ a support of $\pi_x$, we have $\# \{ x \in \Gamma_\mu : y \in \Gamma_{\pi_x} \} \in \{ 0,1 \}$ for all $y$ and $\{ y : \# \{ x \in \Gamma_\mu : y \in \Gamma_{\pi_x} \} = 1 \} = supp(\nu)$. Moreover, if $\mu$ is continuous we may take $\Gamma_{\pi_x} = supp(\pi_x)$ for each $x$. However, we cannot also insist that $\Gamma_\mu = supp (\mu)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wright-Fisher diffusions and their dual ancestral graphs occupy a central role in the study of allele frequency change and genealogical structure, and they provide expressions, explicit in some special cases but generally implicit, for the sampling probability, a crucial quantity in inference. Under a finite-allele mutation model, with possibly parent-dependent mutation, we consider the asymptotic regime where the selective advantage of one allele grows to infinity, while the other parameters remain fixed. In this regime, we show that the Wright-Fisher diffusion can be approximated either by a Gaussian process or by a process whose components are independent continuous-state branching processes with immigration, aligning with analogous results for Wright-Fisher models but employing different methods. While the first process becomes degenerate at stationarity, the latter does not and provides a simple, analytic approximation for the leading term of the sampling probability. Furthermore, using another approach based on a recursion formula, we characterise all remaining terms to provide a full asymptotic expansion for the sampling probability. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the rates of the block-counting process of the conditional ancestral selection graph and establish an asymptotic duality relationship between this and the diffusion.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Markovian lifts of stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) with completely monotone kernels and general coefficients within a class of weighted Sobolev spaces. Our primary focus is developing a comprehensive solution theory for a class of non-local stochastic evolution equations (SEEs) encompassing these Markovian lifts. This enables us to provide conditions for the existence of invariant measures for the lifted processes and the corresponding SVE. Another key contribution is an Ito-type formula for the stochastic Volterra equations under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel-based random graphs (KBRGs) are a broad class of random graph models that account for inhomogeneity among vertices. We consider KBRGs on a discrete $d-$dimensional torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N^d$. Conditionally on an i.i.d.~sequence of {Pareto} weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{\kappa_{\sigma}(W_i,W_j)}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\kappa_{\sigma}(u,v)= (u\vee v)(u \wedge v)^{\sigma}$ for some $\sigma\in(0,\tau-1)$.
  We focus on the adjacency operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. For $\alpha&lt;d$ and $\tau&gt;2$, we show that a non-trivial limiting distribution exists as $N\to\infty$ and that the corresponding measure $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ is given by an operator-valued semicircle law, whose Stieltjes transform is characterised by a fixed point equation in an appropriate Banach space. We analyse the moments of $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ and prove that the second moment is finite even when the weights have infinite variance. In the case $\sigma=1$, corresponding to the so-called scale-free percolation random graph, we can explicitly describe the limiting measure and study its tail.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic modelling necessitates an interpretation of noise. In this paper, we describe the loss of deterministically stable behaviour in a fundamental fluid mechanics problem, conditional to whether noise is introduced in the sense of It\^o, Stratonovich or a limit of Wong-Zakai type. We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretising stochastic differential equations with and without the L\'evy area. From the numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate performing higher order discretisations with the use of a L\'evy area can lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behaviour is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. Conversely, we study Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport and its derivation from homogenisation theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From the viewpoint of homogenisation, the qualitative properties of the Wong-Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.</description>

We show that the complex analogue, i.e. resilience of the polydisc slicing theorem proven by Oleszkiewicz and Pelczy\'nski, holds for large $p$ and small $n$, but does not hold for any $p &gt; 2$ and large $n$.</description>

      <title>Fused Specht Polynomials and $c=1$ Degenerate Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <title>Almost sure bounds for weighted sums of Rademacher random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that when $f$ is a Rademacher random multiplicative function for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, then $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{61/80+\epsilon}$ for almost all $f$. We also show that there exist arbitrarily large values of $x$ such that $\sum_{n \leqslant x}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \gg (\log\log(x))^{-1/2}$. This is different to what is found in the Steinhaus case, this time with the size of the Rademacher Euler product making the multiplicative chaos contribution the dominant one. We also find a sharper upper bound when we restrict to integers with a prime factor greater than $\sqrt{x}$, proving that $\sum_{\substack{n \leqslant x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}}\frac{f(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ll (\log\log(x))^{21/80+\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of points in general position in a random subset of finite $3$-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ be the maximum possible size of a point set in general position in the $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. In this note, we determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{3},p)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor by proving a balanced supersaturation result for the sets of $4$ points in the same plane.</description>
