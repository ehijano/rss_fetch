      <title>On the proximal dynamics between integrable and non-integrable members of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries family of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distance between the solutions to the integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and a broad class of non-integrable generalized KdV (gKdV) equations is estimated in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales.</description>

      <title>Random initial data and average shock time in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with long-wavelength random initial data. When the energy per particle is small, thermal equilibrium is not reached on a fast timescale and the system enters prethermalization. The formation of the prethermal state is characterized by the development of a Burgers-type shock and the onset of a turbulent-like spectrum with a time dependent exponent $\zeta(t)$ in the inertial range. We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit. For large $p$, this time scales as $(p \sqrt{\log p})^{-1}$, where $p$ is the number of excited modes proving that it is an intensive quantity up to a logarithmic correction in the size of the system.</description>

      <title>Measuring FPUT thermalization with Toda integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the ergodic properties of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ model for generic initial conditions using a Toda integral. It serves as an adiabatic invariant for the system and a suitable observable to measure its equilibrium time. Over this timescale, the onset of action diffusion results in ergodic temporal fluctuations. We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density. We measure the dependence of energy density on the critical system size and relate this observation to the possible emergence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser regime. We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N.</description>
