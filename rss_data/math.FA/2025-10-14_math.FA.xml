      <title>H-harmonic reproducing kernels on the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Szeg\H{o} reproducing kernel associated with the space of $H$-harmonic functions on the unit ball in n-dimensional space, i.e. functions that are characterized by being annihilated by the hyperbolic Laplacian. This paper derives an explicit series expansion for the reproducing kernel in terms of a triple hypergeometric function introduced of Exton. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Szeg\H{o} kernel admits a representation as a finite sum of hypergeometric functions. We further show that the Szeg\H{o} kernel, for linearly dependent arguments, can be expressed in terms of the first Appell hypergeometric function. In addition we provide a series expansion for the weighted Bergman kernels.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theory For Singh-Chatterjea Type Contractive Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new contraction condition that combines the framework of Singh's extension with the classical Chatterjea contraction. This generalized form, called the Singh-Chatterjea contraction, is defined on the p-th iterate of a mapping. We establish fixed point theorems for such mappings in complete metric spaces and show that our results extend and unify both Singh's and Chatterjea's classical fixed point theorems. Illustrative examples and a simple numerical implementation are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the study of proper affine isometric actions of countable discrete groups in various spaces plays a crucial role in geometric group theory, operator algebras, and high-dimensional topology.
  In this article, we shall construct a proper affine isometric action of countable discrete group $\Gamma$ on the Banach space $\oplus_{n=1}^\infty\ell^{2n}(\Gamma)$ such that the cocycles have decay rates that are better than those of Haagerup and Przybyszewska in.</description>

      <title>Dual Truncated Hankel Operators: Characterization and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the Dual Truncated Hankel Operator (DTHO) and provide several operator equation characterizations using the dual compressed shift operator. These characterizations are similar to classical results concerning Hankel operators and align with recent findings related to Truncated Hankel Operators (THO) \cite{GM}. Additionally, our work addresses comprehensive solutions to various operator equations encountered in studying THO and the classical Hankel operator. We have also established some fundamental operator-theoretic properties of DTHO that apply to general symbols and symbols under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Metric Sobolev spaces II: dual energies and divergence measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several approaches to vector calculus in the non-smooth setting of complete and separable metric spaces equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. More precisely, we study different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations appearing in the literature, as well as their mutual relation. We also carry forward a thorough investigation of gradients, divergence measures, and Laplacian measures, together with their applications in potential analysis (for example, regarding the condenser capacity) and in the study of duality properties of Sobolev spaces. Most of the results are obtained for the full range of exponents $p\in[1,\infty)$ and without finiteness assumption on the measure.</description>

      <title>Mean and pointwise ergodicity for composition operators on rearrangement-invariant spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ergodicity of composition operators on rearrangement-invariant Banach function spaces. More precisely, we give a natural and easy-to-check condition on the symbol of the operator which entails mean ergodicity on a very large class of rearrangement-invariant Banach function spaces. Further, we present some natural additional assumptions that allow us to obtain pointwise ergodicity. The class of spaces covered by our results contains many non-reflexive spaces, such as the Lorentz spaces $L^{p, 1}$ and $L^{p,\infty}$, $p \in (1, \infty)$, Orlicz spaces $L \log^{\alpha} L$ and $\exp L^{\alpha}$, $\alpha &gt; 0$, and the spaces $L^1$ and $L^{\infty}$ over measure spaces of finite measure. The main novelty in our approach is the application of a new locally convex topology which we introduce and which lies strictly between the norm topology and the weak topology induced by the associate space. Throughout, we give several examples which illustrate the applicability of our results as well as highlight the necessity and optimality of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>A note on irreducibility for topical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topical maps are a nonlinear generalization of nonnegative matrices acting on the interior of the standard cone $\mathbb{R}^n_{\ge 0}$. Several analogues of irreducibility have been defined for topical maps, and all are sufficient to guarantee the existence of entrywise positive eigenvectors. In this note, we organize several of these notions, showing which conditions are stronger and when different types of irreducibility are equivalent. We also consider how to computationally check the conditions. We show that certain irreducibility conditions can be expressed as Boolean satisfiability problems that can be checked using SAT solvers. This can be used to confirm the existence of entrywise positive eigenvectors when the dimension is large.</description>

      <title>On $\alpha$-monotone operators and their resolvent in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new definition of $\alpha$-monotone operators in real 2-uniformly convex and smooth Banach spaces. Based on this new definition, we establish several novel structural and analytical properties of such operators, which not only extend classical results from Hilbert spaces but also reveal new insights into the geometry of Banach spaces. In particular, we examine the resolvent of $\alpha$-maximal monotone operators and demonstrate how its behavior is consistent with, and generalizes, the well-known firmly nonexpansive property in the Hilbert space setting. Building upon this theoretical framework, we further investigate algorithmic applications. Specifically, we analyze the forward-reflected-backward splitting algorithm under the new $\alpha$-monotonicity assumption and prove its strong convergence as well as its $R$-linear convergence rate in real 2-uniformly convex and smooth Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Empirical bounds for commuting dilations of free unitaries and the universal commuting dilation constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tuple $T$ of Hilbert space operators, the 'commuting dilation constant' is the smallest number $c$ such that the operators of $T$ are a simultaneous compression of commuting normal operators of norm at most $c$. We present numerical experiments giving a strong indication that the commuting dilation constant of a pair of independent random $N{\times}N$ unitary matrices converges to $\sqrt2$ as $N \to \infty$ almost surely. Under the assumption that this is the case, we prove that the commuting dilation constant of an arbitrary pair of contractions is strictly smaller than $2$. Our experiments are based on a simple algorithm that we introduce for the purpose of computing dilation constants between tuples of matrices.</description>

      <title>On Korovkin-type theorems including exponential test functions on infinite intervals through power series convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximation theory has long been concerned with the development of positive linear operators that effectively approximate classes of functions. Among the most well-known results in this area are Korovkin-type approximation theorems, which provide simple and elegant criteria for convergence by testing only on a small set of functions. Motivated by these classical results and their extensions, we focus on versions that preserve exponential functions and incorporate modern summability techniques. In this paper, we establish Korovkin-type theorems that preserve exponential functions by employing power series convergence and a special case thereof. By considering approximation through Borel-type power series convergence via integral summability, we provide an alternative framework that applies in cases where classical convergence or ordinary Borel convergence fails, and we offer a comparative analysis of the corresponding theorems. We also present illustrative examples in which the classical results fail, while the proposed approach remains applicable. In addition, the rate of convergence is analyzed through the modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory and dispersive estimates for general $1$d Charge Transfer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our study of scattering theory and dispersive properties for one-dimensional charge transfer models, namely linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials. By the discovery of a refined structure of the construction of distorted Fourier transforms adapted to the multi-potential framework, we remove the large-velocity separation assumption imposed in [8]. This work thus completes the full scattering theory and dispersive analysis for general one-dimensional charge transfer models. These dispersive estimates provide the foundation for analyzing asymptotic stability and collision phenomena for multi-solitons in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Bilateral facial reduction: qualification-free subdifferential calculus and exact duality in convex analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric framework to extend convex analysis results beyond standard qualification conditions such as intersecting relative interiors of domains. We define the joint facial subspace $T$ as the span of the face of $C - D$ generated by $0$, with its affine translation $T_a$ containing $C \cap D$. The intersections $C \cap T_a$ and $D \cap T_a$ are faces of the original sets, establishing $T_a$ as a bilateral facial reduction with parallels to Borwein-Wolkowicz facial reduction in conic programming. When reducing the domains of two convex functions to their joint facial subspace $T_a$, their relative interiors then always intersect, enabling unqualified application of classical theorems via localization. Key generalizations include subdifferential additivity, normal cones of intersections, a subdifferential chain rule, attained infimal convolution for $(f+g)^*,$ and an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual. We characterize $T$ via generated faces and computationally through an iterative process converging in at most $n$ steps in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Proofs are self-contained and introduce novel concepts like facial subspaces and nested normals to describe convex boundaries and the lattice of faces.</description>

Abstract: We derive the weak elliptic Harnack inequality and the elliptic Harnack inequality for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-energy form on metric measure spaces. The proof relies on the Poincar\'e inequality, the cutoff Sobolev inequality, and some mild conditions on the jump measure. Our approach is based on the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser method, extending the corresponding result for Dirichlet forms without a killing part (the case $p=2$).</description>

Abstract: We introduce Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces on a manifold with boundary adapted to H\"ormander vector fields, near a so-called non-characteristic point of the boundary. We prove sharp results in these spaces for the corresponding restriction and trace operators, show these operators are retractions, and other related results. This is the second paper in a forthcoming series devoted to a general theory of maximally subelliptic boundary value problems, and lays the function space foundation for this general theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the concept of Wiener-Luxemburg amalgam spaces which are a modification of the more classical Wiener amalgam spaces intended to address some of the shortcomings the latter face in the context of rearrangement-invariant Banach function spaces.
  We introduce the Wiener-Luxemburg amalgam spaces and study their properties, including (but nor limited to) their normability, embeddings between them and their associate spaces. We also study amalgams of quasi-Banach function spaces and introduce a necessary generalisation of the concept of associate spaces. We then apply this general theory to resolve the question whether the Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya principle holds for all r.i. quasi-Banach function spaces. Finally, we illustrate the asserted shortcomings of Wiener amalgam spaces by providing counterexamples to certain properties of Banach function spaces as well as rearrangement invariance.</description>

      <title>A max filtering local stability theorem with application to weighted phase retrieval and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, max filtering offers a rich class of convex $G$-invariant maps. In this paper, we identify sufficient conditions under which these maps are locally bilipschitz on $R(G)$, the set of orbits with maximal dimension, with respect to the quotient metric on the orbit space $V/G$. Central to our proof is a desingularization theorem, which applies to open, dense neighborhoods around each orbit in $R(G)/G$ and may be of independent interest.
  As an application, we provide guarantees for stable weighted phase retrieval. That is, we construct componentwise convex bilipschitz embeddings of weighted complex (resp.\ quaternionic) projective spaces. These spaces arise as quotients of direct sums of nontrivial unitary irreducible complex (resp.\ quaternionic) representations of the group of unit complex numbers $S^1\cong \operatorname{SO}(2)$ (resp.\ unit quaternions $S^3\cong \operatorname{SU}(2)$).
  We also discuss the relevance of such embeddings to a nearest-neighbor problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a leading technique for resolving the spatial structure of biological molecules.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Operator-Valued Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new kind of measures, called projection families, which generalize the classical notion of vector and operator-valued measures. The maximal class of reasonable functions admits an integral with respect to a projection family, where the integral is defined as an element of the second dual instead of the original space. We show that projection families possess strong enough properties to satisfy the theorems of Monotone Convergence and Dominated convergence, but are much easier to come by than the more restrictive operator-valued measures.</description>

      <title>Reflections in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|&lt;1\}$ and $\mathbb{T}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|=1\}$. For $a\in\mathbb{D}$, consider $\varphi_a(z)=\frac{a-z}{1-\bar{a}z}$ and $C_a$ the composition operator in $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ induced by $\varphi_a$: $$ C_a f=f\circ\varphi_a. $$ Clearly $C_a$ satisties $C_a^2=I$, i.e., is a non-selfadjoint reflection. We also consider the following symmetries (selfadjoint reflections) related to $C_a$: $$ R_a=M_{\frac{|k_a|}{\|k_a\|_2}}C_a \ \hbox{ and } \ W_a=M_{\frac{k_a}{\|k_a\|_2}}C_a, $$ where $k_a(z)=\frac{1}{1-\bar{a}z}$ is the Szego kernel. The symmetry $R_a$ is the unitary part in the polar decomposition of $C_a$. We characterize the eigenspaces $N(T_a\pm I)$ for $T_a=C_a, R_a$ or $W_a$, and study their relative positions when one changes the parameter $a$, e.g., $N(T_a\pm I)\cap N(T_b\pm I)$, $N(T_a\pm I)\cap N(T_b\pm I)^\perp$, $N(T_a\pm I)^\perp\cap N(T_b\pm I)$, etc., for $a\ne b\in\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Dirac system with respect to a spectral parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac system of ordinary differential equations \[ Y'(x) + \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \sigma_1(x) \\ \sigma_2(x) &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} Y(x) = i\mu \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} Y(x), \quad Y(x) = \begin{bmatrix} y_1(x) \\ y_2(x) \end{bmatrix}, \] where $x \in [0,1]$, $\mu \in \mathbb{C}$ is a spectral parameter, and $\sigma_j \in L^p[0,1],$ $j = 1,2,$ for $p \in [1,2).$ We study the asymptotic behavior of the system's fundamental solutions as $|\mu| \to \infty$ in the half-plane $\operatorname{Im} \mu &gt; -r,$ where $r \geq 0$ is fixed, and obtain detailed asymptotic formulas. As an application, we derive new results on the half-plane asymptotics of fundamental solutions to Sturm--Liouville equations with singular potentials.</description>

      <title>On the weighted Wiener-L\'evy theorem: analogue on Euclidean space, strong converse on LCA group and applications to modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the space (weighted Fourier algebra) of Banach algebra valued functions $A^q_{\omega}(\Gamma,\cX),$ which consists of all Fourier transforms of functions in $L^q_\omega(G,\cX)$. Here $\omega$ is a Beurling-Domar type weight on a discrete abelian group $G$, $\Gamma$ is the dual of $G$, and $\cX$ is a unital commutative Banach algebra. We shall prove a strong converse of the Wiener-L\'evy theorem in vector valued weighted setting. Specifically, we proved that if $F$ is a $\cX-$valued function defined on $\mathbb{C}$ such that the composition $F\circ f:\Gamma\to\cX$ is in $A^q(\Gamma,\cX)$ ($1\leq q &lt;2$) for all $f\in A^1_\omega(\Gamma,\mathbb{C})$, then $F$ must be real analytic on $\mathbb R^2$. Here the range of $q$ is sharp. Further, its multivariate analogue and analogue for locally compact abelian $G$ are also established. This is the first result which generalizes the classic theorems of Helson, Kahane, Katznelson and Rudin \cite{helson,rud} in the presence of proposed weight. On the other hand, we established the analogue of Wiener-L\'evy theorem in Euclidean Fourier algebra $A_{\omega}^q(\mathbb R^d)$ for a weight $\omega$ of regular growth.
  As an application, we establish similar results for weighted modulation, Wiener amalgam and Fourier amalgam spaces. This complements the work of Bhimani-Ratnakumar \cite{bhimani2016functions} and Feichtinger-Kobayashi-Sato \cite{HGWL1, HGWL2}; and enables us to shed light on nonlinearity while understanding the dynamics of dispersive PDE in these spaces.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the proof of his famous 5K-theorem, W. Banaszczyk introduced a transformation of convex bodies for which the Gaussian measure is monotone. In this note, we present a simplified proof of this monotonicity by slightly modifying Banaszczyk's transform, so that it interacts smoothly with Ehrhard symmetrizations, thereby yielding a somewhat easier proof of the 5K-theorem.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Mathematical Morphology for grey-level functions, an image is analysed by another image named the structuring function. This structuring function is translated over the image domain and summed to the image. However, in an image presenting lighting variations, the amplitude of the structuring function should vary according to the image intensity. Such a property is not verified in Mathematical Morphology for grey level functions, when the structuring function is summed to the image with the usual additive law. In order to address this issue, a new framework is defined with an additive law for which the amplitude of the structuring function varies according to the image amplitude. This additive law is chosen within the Logarithmic Image Processing framework and models the lighting variations with a physical cause such as a change of light intensity. The new framework is named Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology (LMM) and allows the definition of operators which are robust to such lighting variations.</description>

      <title>An efficient and exact noncommutative quantum Gibbs sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal and ground states is an essential quantum algorithmic task for quantum simulation. In this work, we construct the first efficiently implementable and exactly detailed-balanced Lindbladian for Gibbs states of arbitrary noncommutative Hamiltonians. Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\sim\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free "parent Hamiltonians", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state). These favorable features suggest that our construction serves as a quantum algorithmic counterpart to classical Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaplectic operators form a relevant class of operators appearing in different applications, in the present work we study their Schwartz kernels. Namely, diagonality of a kernel is defined by imposing rapid off-diagonal decay conditions, and quasi-diagonality by imposing the same conditions on the smoothing of the kernel through convolution with the Gaussian. Kernels of metaplectic operators are not diagonal. Nevertheless, as we shall prove, they are quasi-diagonal under suitable conditions. Motivation for our study comes from problems in time-frequency analysis, that we discuss in the last section.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient}. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>
