      <title>The Flapping Birds in the Pentagram Zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $(k+1,k)$ diagonal map for $k=2,3,4,...$. We call this map $\Delta_k$. The map $\Delta_1$ is the pentagram map and $\Delta_k$ is a generalization. $\Delta_k$ does not preserve convexity, but we prove that $\Delta_k$ preserves a subset $B_k$ of certain star-shaped polygons which we call $k$-birds. The action of $\Delta_k$ on $B_k$ seems similar to the action of $\Delta_1$ on the space of convex polygons. We show that some classic geometric results about $\Delta_1$ generalize to this setting.</description>

      <title>Bi-center conditions and bifurcation of limit cycles in a class of $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems with two nilpotent points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Poincar\'e-Lyapunov method for systems with linear type centers to study nilpotent centers in switching polynomial systems and use it to investigate the bi-center problem of planar $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems associated with two symmetric nilpotent singular points. With a properly designed perturbation, 6 explicit bi-center conditions for such polynomial systems are derived. Then, based on the $6$ center conditions, by using Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation theory with general perturbations, we prove that there exist at least $20$ small-amplitude limit cycles around the nilpotent bi-center for a class of $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems. This is a new lower bound of cyclicity for such cubic polynomial systems, increased from $12$ to $20$.</description>

      <title>Permanence for continuous-time competitive Kolmogorov systems via the carrying simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the permanence and impermanence for continuous-time competitive Kolmogorov systems via the carrying simplex. We first give an extension to attractors of V. Hutson's results on the existence of repellors in continuous-time dynamical systems that have found wide use in the study of permanence via average Liapunov functions. We then give a general criterion for the stability of the boundary of carrying simplex for competitive Kolmogorov systems of differential equations, which determines the permanence and impermanence of such systems. Based on the criterion, we present a complete classification of the permanence and impermanence in terms of inequalities on parameters for all three-dimensional competitive systems which have linearly determined nullclines. The results are applied to many classical models in population dynamics including the Lotka-Volterrra system, Gompertz system, Leslie-Gower system and Ricker system.</description>

      <title>Another look at Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition in the regime of fewer Snapshots than Dictionary Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) offers a method for accurately computing the spectral properties of Koopman operators. It achieves this by calculating an infinite-dimensional residual from snapshot data, thus overcoming issues associated with finite truncations of Koopman operators, such as spurious eigenvalues. These spectral properties include spectra and pseudospectra, spectral measures, Koopman mode decompositions, and dictionary verification. In scenarios where there are fewer snapshots than dictionary size, particularly for exact DMD and kernelized EDMD, ResDMD has traditionally been applied by dividing snapshot data into a training set and a quadrature set. Through a novel computational approach of solving a dual least-squares problem, we demonstrate how to eliminate the need for two datasets. We provide an analysis of these new residuals for exact DMD and kernelized EDMD, demonstrating ResDMD's versatility and broad applicability across various dynamical systems, including those modeled by high-dimensional and nonlinear observables. The utility of these new residuals is showcased through three diverse examples: the analysis of cylinder wake, the study of aerofoil cascades, and the compression of transient shockwave experimental data. This approach not only simplifies the application of ResDMD but also extends its potential for deeper insights into the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of oblique irradiation on the onset of thermal-phototactic-bioconvection in an isotropic scattering algal suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, our focus is mainly to check the effect of light scattering on the onset of thermal-phototactic-bioconvection in an algal suspension where the suspension is illuminated by the collimated oblique irradiation from above while simultaneously applying heating or cooling from below. We conduct a numerical investigation into the linear stability of a suspension containing phototactic algae, focusing particularly on how the angle of incidence of oblique collimated irradiation influences the system. Our solutions reveal a transition of the most unstable mode from a stationary to an overstable state, or vice versa, under certain parameter configurations as the angle of incidence varies. Additionally, we frequently observe oscillatory instabilities in cases where the upper surface is rigid, particularly as the angle of incidence increases within the suspension.</description>

      <title>Effect of oblique irradiation on the onset of thermal phototactic bioconvection in non-scattering medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of a suspension of phototactic algae is investigated numerically with particular emphasis on the effects of the angle of incidence of the illuminating oblique collimated irradiation with thermal effects. The suspension is illuminated by the oblique collimated irradiation from the top and heated/cooled from the bottom. The linear stability analysis shows that the suspension becomes more unstable as the angle of incidence increases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gottschalk's conjecture for sofic groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish generalizations of the well-known surjunctivity theorem of Gromov and Weiss as well as the dual-surjunctivity theorem of Capobianco, Kari and Taati for cellular automata (CA) to local perturbations of CA over sofic group universes. We also extend the results to a class of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) consisting of global perturbations with uniformly bounded singularity of CA. As an application, we obtain the surjunctivity of algebraic NUCA with uniformly bounded singularity over sofic groups. Moreover, we prove the stable finiteness of twisted group rings over sofic groups to generalize known results on Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture for group rings.</description>

      <title>SFT covers for actions of the first Grigorchuk group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symbolic dynamical representations of actions of the first Grigorchuk group $G$, namely its action on the boundary of the infinite rooted binary tree, its representation in the topological full group of a minimal substitutive $\mathbb{Z}$-shift, and its representation as a minimal system of Schreier graphs. We show that the first system admits an SFT cover, and the latter two systems are conjugate to sofic subshifts on $G$, but are not of finite type.</description>

      <title>Rigid Poisson suspensions without roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examples of rigid Poisson suspensions without roots are presented. The discrete rational component in spectrum of an ergodic automorphism S prevents some roots from existing. If S is tensorly multiplied by an ergodic automorphism of the space with a sigma-finite measure, discrete spectrum disappears in this product, but the memory of it can remain in the form of the absence of roots. In additional conditions, this effect is inherited by the Poisson suspension over the product.</description>

      <title>On stochastic string stability with applications to platooning over additive noise channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the string stabilization of vehicular platooning when stochastic phenomena are inherent in inter-vehicle communication. To achieve this, we first provide two definitions to analytically assess the string stability in stochastic scenarios, considering the mean and variance of tracking errors as the platoon size grows. Subsequently, we analytically derive necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this notion of string stability in predecessor-following linear platoons that communicate through additive white noise channels. We conclude that the condition ensuring string stability with ideal communication is essentially the same that achieves stochastic string stability when additive noise channels are in place and guarantees that the tracking error means and variances converge.</description>

      <title>tLaSDI: Thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven latent space dynamics identification method (tLaSDI) that embeds the first and second principles of thermodynamics. The latent variables are learned through an autoencoder as a nonlinear dimension reduction model. The dynamics of the latent variables are constructed by a neural network-based model that preserves certain structures to respect the thermodynamic laws through the GENERIC formalism. An abstract error estimate of the approximation is established, which provides a new loss formulation involving the Jacobian computation of autoencoder. Both the autoencoder and the latent dynamics are trained to minimize the new loss. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of tLaSDI, which exhibits robust generalization ability, even in extrapolation. In addition, an intriguing correlation is empirically observed between the entropy production rates in the latent space and the behaviors of the full-state solution.</description>

      <title>On constructive extractability of measurable selectors of set-valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of constructive extraction of measurable selector from set-valued maps which may commonly arise in viability theory, optimal control, discontinuous systems etc. For instance, existence of solutions to certain differential inclusions, often requires iterative extraction of measurable selectors. Next, optimal controls are in general non-unique which naturally leads to an optimal set-valued function. Finally, a viable control law can be seen, in general, as a selector. It is known that selector theorems are non-constructive and so selectors cannot always be extracted. In this work, we analyze under which particular conditions selectors are constructively extractable. An algorithm is derived from the theorem and applied in a computational study with a three-wheel robot model.</description>

      <title>On the quantum Guerra-Morato Action Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth potential $W:\mathrm{T}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the torus, the Quantum Guerra-Morato action functional is given by \smallskip
  $ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, I(\psi) = \int\,(\, \, \,\frac{D v\, D v^*}{2}(x) - W(x) \,) \,\,a(x)^2 dx,$ \smallskip
  \noindent where $\psi $ is described by $\psi = a\, e^{i\,\frac{ u }{h}} $, $ u =\, \frac{v + v^*}{2},$ $a=e^{\,\frac{v^*\,-\,v}{2\, \hbar} }$, $v,v ^*$ are real functions, $\int a^2 (x) d x =1$, and $D$ is derivative on $x \in \mathrm{T}^{n}$. It is natural to consider the constraint $ \mathrm{d}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{v}(a^{2}Du)=0$, which means flux zero. The $a$ and $u$ obtained from a critical solution (under variations $\tau$) for such action functional, fulfilling such constraints, satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a quantum potential. Denote $'=\frac{d}{d\tau}$. We show that the expression for the second variation of a critical solution is given by
  \smallskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int a^{2}\,D[ v' ]\, D [(v ^*)']\, dx.$
  \smallskip
  Introducing the constraint $\int a^2 \,D u \,dx =V$, we also consider later an associated dual eigenvalue problem. From this follows a transport and a kind of eikonal equation.</description>

Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers where scissor congruence and K-theoretical invariants are related to cobordism groups of foams in various dimensions. A model example is provided where the cobordism group of weighted one-foams is identified, via the Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant, with the first homology of the group of interval exchange automorphisms and with the Zakharevich first K-group of the corresponding assembler. Several variations on this cobordism group are computed as well.</description>

Abstract: The tool mpbn offers a Python programming interface for an easy interactive editing of Boolean networks and the efficient computation of elementary properties of their dynamics, including fixed points, trap spaces, and reachability properties under the Most Permissive update mode. Relying on Answer-Set Programming logical framework, we show that mpbn is scalable to models with several thousands of nodes and is one of the best-performing tool for computing minimal and maximal trap spaces of Boolean networks, a key feature for understanding and controling their stable behaviors.

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions $W_n(x)=-n^2 \wp(nx+\tfrac{1}{2}\tau),\ n=1,2,3,\ldots$, with lattice periods 1 and the purely imaginary modular parameter $\tau$, and with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$ at $\lambda=\tfrac{1}{2}n^4 g_2(\tau)$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of the real analytic heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For any fixed real $r_0$, for example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotically Almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spatial evolution of degenerate quartets of water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we investigate the Benjamin-Feir (or modulation) instability for the spatial evolution of water waves from the perspective of the discrete, spatial Zakharov equation, which captures cubically nonlinear and resonant wave interactions in deep water without restrictions on spectral bandwidth. Spatial evolution, with measurements at discrete locations, is pertinent for laboratory hydrodynamic experiments, such as in wave flumes, which rely on time-series measurements at a series of fixed gauges installed along the facility. This setting is likewise appropriate for experiments in electromagnetic and plasma waves. Through a reformulation of the problem for a degenerate quartet, we bring to bear techniques of phase-plane analysis which elucidate the full dynamics without recourse to linear stability analysis. In particular we find hitherto unexplored breather solutions and discuss the optimal transfer of energy from carrier to sidebands. Finally, we discuss the observability of such discrete solutions in light of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic billiards and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of certain lens spaces with respect to the round metric. Interestingly we find that the Hofer-Zehnder capacity does not see the covering, i.e. the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the lens space coincides with the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the 3-sphere covering it. In particular, this gives a first example, where Gromov width and Hofer-Zehnder capacity of a disk tangent bundle disagree. Techniques we use include for the lower bound magnetic billiards and for the upper bound Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the multiplier spectrum of periodic points, which is a natural morphism defined on the moduli space of rational maps on the projective line. A celebrated theorem of McMullen asserts that aside from the well-understood flexible Latt\`es family, the multiplier spectrum morphism is quasi-finite. In this paper, we strengthen McMullen's theorem by showing that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective. This answers a question of McMullen and Poonen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the variational approach, we prove the existence of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures for partially hyperbolic $\mathcal C^1$ diffeomorphisms with mostly expanding properties. The same conclusion holds true if one considers a dominated splitting $E\oplus F$, where $\dim E=1$ and $F$ is mostly expanding. When the diffeomorphisms are $\mathcal C^{1+\alpha}$, we prove the basin covering property for both cases.</description>

Abstract: We establish large deviation estimates related to the Darling--Kac theorem and generalized arcsine laws for occupation and waiting times of ergodic transformations preserving an infinite measure, such as non-uniformly expanding interval maps with indifferent fixed points. For the proof, we imitate the study of generalized arcsine laws for occupation times of one-dimensional diffusion processes and adopt a method of double Laplace transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of strong closing property of contact forms, inspired by the $C^\infty$ closing lemma for Reeb flows in dimension three. We then prove a sufficient criterion for strong closing property, which is formulated by considering a monoidal functor from a category of manifolds with contact forms to a category of filtered vector spaces. As a potential application of this criterion, we propose a conjecture which says that a standard contact form on the boundary of any symplectic ellipsoid satisfies strong closing property.</description>

Abstract: Measure equivalence was introduced by Gromov as a measured analogue of quasi-isometry. Unlike the latter, measure equivalence does not preserve the large scale geometry of groups and happens to be very flexible in the amenable world. Indeed the Ornstein-Weiss theorem shows that all infinite countable amenable groups are measure equivalent to the group of integers. To refine this equivalence relation and make it responsive to geometry, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera introduced a quantitative version of measure equivalence. They also defined a relaxed version of this notion called quantitative measure subgroup coupling. In this article we offer to answer the inverse problem of the quantification (find a group admitting a measure subgroup coupling with a prescribed group with prescribed quantification) in the case of the lamplighter group.</description>

      <title>A geometric representative for the fundamental class in KK-duality of Smale spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental ingredient in the noncommutative geometry program is the notion of KK-duality, often called K-theoretic Poincar\'{e} duality, that generalises Spanier-Whitehead duality. In this paper we construct a $\theta$-summable Fredholm module that represents the fundamental class in KK-duality between the stable and unstable Ruelle algebras of a Smale space. To find such a representative, we construct dynamical partitions of unity on the Smale space with highly controlled Lipschitz constants. This requires a generalisation of Bowen's Markov partitions. Along with an aperiodic point-sampling technique we produce a noncommutative analogue of Whitney's embedding theorem, leading to the Fredholm module.</description>

      <title>Markov $\alpha$-Potential Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new framework of Markov $\alpha$-potential games to study Markov games. In this new framework, Markov games are shown to be Markov $\alpha$-potential games, and the existence of an associated $\alpha$-potential function is established. Any optimizer of an $\alpha$-potential function is shown to be an $\alpha$-stationary NE. Two important classes of practically significant Markov games, Markov congestion games and the perturbed Markov team games, are studied via this framework of Markov $\alpha$-potential games, with explicit characterization of an upper bound for $\alpha$ and its relation to game parameters. Additionally, a semi-infinite linear programming based formulation is presented to obtain an upper bound for $\alpha$ for any Markov game. Furthermore, two equilibrium approximation algorithms, namely the projected gradient-ascent algorithm and the sequential maximum improvement algorithm, are presented along with their Nash regret analysis, and corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sampling via Gradient Flows in the Space of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling a target probability distribution with an unknown normalization constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering. Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development. This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows, discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and numerically.</description>

Abstract: We investigate and compare applications of the Zilber-Pink conjecture and dynamical methods to rigidity problems for arithmetic real and complex hyperbolic lattices. Along the way we obtain new general results about reconstructing a variation of Hodge structures from its typical Hodge locus that may be of independent interest. Applications to Siu's immersion problem are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Wrappingness and Trunkenness of Volume-Preserving Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link invariants of long pieces of orbits of a volume-preserving flow can be used to define diffeomorphism invariants of the flow. In this paper, we extend the notions of wrapping number and trunk and define invariants of links with respect to a fibration on a 3-manifold. Extending work of Dehornoy and Rechtman, we apply this to define diffeomorphism invariants wrappingness and trunkenness of volume-preserving flows on 3-manifolds and interpret these invariants as obstructions to the existence of a global surface of section for the flow. Finally, we construct flows and show that wrappingness and trunkenness are not functions of the helicity of a flow.</description>
