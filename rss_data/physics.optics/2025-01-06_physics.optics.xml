      <title>Dynamic realization of emergent high-dimensional optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimensionality of vortical structures has recently been extended beyond two dimensions, providing higher-order topological characteristics and robustness for high-capacity information processing and turbulence control. The generation of high-dimensional vortical structures has mostly been demonstrated in classical systems through the complex interference of fluidic, acoustic, or electromagnetic waves. However, natural materials rarely support three- or higher-dimensional vortical structures and their physical interactions. Here, we present a high-dimensional gradient thickness optical cavity (GTOC) in which the optical coupling of planar metal-dielectric multilayers implements topological interactions across multiple dimensions. Topological interactions in high-dimensional GTOC construct non-trivial topological phases, which induce high-dimensional vortical structures in generalized parameter space in three, four dimensions, and beyond. These emergent high-dimensional vortical structures are observed under electro-optic tomography as optical vortex dynamics in two-dimensional real-space, employing the optical thicknesses of the dielectric layers as synthetic dimensions. We experimentally demonstrate emergent vortical structures, optical vortex lines and vortex rings, in a three-dimensional generalized parameter space and their topological transitions. Furthermore, we explore four-dimensional vortical structures, termed optical vortex sheets, which provide the programmability of real-space optical vortex dynamics. Our findings hold significant promise for emulating high-dimensional physics and developing active topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Implementing photonic-crystal resonator frequency combs in a photonics foundry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an AIM Photonics silicon-nitride platform to fabricate photonic-crystal resonators for generating optical parametric oscillators (OPO) and soliton microcombs. Our approach leverages the scalability and fine feature size of silicon-nitride processing on large-scale silicon wafers to achieve low-loss, high-Q microresonators, functionalized by nano-scale photonic-crystal structures. We demonstrate intrinsic microresonator quality factor up to 1.2*10^7 with complete foundry fabrication on 300 mm silicon, a 700 nm thick silicon-nitride device layer, and inclusion of complex nanophotonics. These features enable a host of nonlinear nanophotonics sources on the platform, including OPOs, microcombs, parametric amplifiers, squeezed-light generators, and single-photon sources. By fine-tuning the photonic-crystal design parameters, we achieve broad tunability in the frequency of the OPO output, spanning a significant portion of the near-infrared. Additionally, we observe the formation of soliton frequency combs, enabled by the precise dispersion engineering of the microresonators. These results highlight the potential of widely accessible, photolithographically patterned, silicon-nitride photonics to enable wide access to and complex integration of frequency-comb sources, with applications in spectroscopy, metrology, and communications.</description>

      <title>Fiber-based mid-infrared frequency-swept laser at 50 MScans/s via frequency down-conversion of time-stretched pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the sweep rate of mid-infrared (MIR) frequency-swept sources offers significant potential for various high-speed spectroscopy-based applications. While continuous-wave frequency-swept lasers have achieved sweep rates up to 1 MHz, a recently demonstrated time-stretched ultrashort pulsed laser has reached a significantly higher sweep rate, up to tens of MHz. However, the previous system relied on a bulky femtosecond optical parametric oscillator and produced only ~30 discrete spectral elements due to the use of a free-space time stretcher. In this work, we present a fiber-based frequency-swept MIR source that utilizes the frequency down-conversion of time-stretched near-infrared pulses, employing a compact mode-locked fiber laser and telecommunication fiber. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we performed MIR spectroscopy of methane gas around 3.4 um at a rate of 50 MSpectra/s, capturing 220 spectral elements over a range of 19.0 cm-1. This compact and robust high-speed MIR frequency-swept laser system holds the potential for deployment in field applications.</description>

      <title>Electron hopping induced phonon pumping in opto-mechanical molecular nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as practically implementable quantum-mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>In-operando control of sum-frequency generation in tip-enhanced nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) is a second-order nonlinear process widely used for characterizing surfaces and interfaces with monolayer sensitivity. Recently, optical field enhancement in plasmonic nanocavities has enabled SFG with continuous wave (CW) lasers from nanoscale areas of molecules, promising applications like nanoscale SFG spectroscopy and coherent upconversion for mid-infrared detection at visible frequencies. Here, we demonstrate CW SFG from individual nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities, which are resonant at visible frequencies and filled with a monolayer of molecules, when placed beneath a metal scanning probe tip. The tip acts as an efficient broadband antenna, focusing incident CW infrared illumination onto the nanocavity. The cascaded near-field enhancement within the NPoM nanocavity yields nonlinear optical responses across a broad range of infrared frequencies, achieving SFG enhancements of up to 14 orders of magnitude. Further, nanomechanical positioning of the tip allows for in-operando control of SFG by tuning the local field enhancement rather than the illumination intensities. The versatility of tip-enhanced nanocavities allows for SFG studies of a wide range of molecular species in the few-molecule regime without the need for complex nanofabrication of doubly-resonant nanocavities. Our results also promise SFG nanoimaging with tips providing strong visible and IR field enhancement at their apex, offering a robust platform for future applications in nonlinear nanooptics.</description>

      <title>780 nm Compact Optical Clock Down-Conversion for Microwave Frequencies with $10^{-14}$ instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated a compact rubidium optical clock, which includes an optical frequency standard and an optical frequency comb, with an optical path volume of merely 11.6 liters. The laser frequency is stabilized to the hyperfine transitions of the rubidium D2 line using modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS), which eliminites Doppler background and provides a high signal to noise ratio and high sensitivity. A 300 MHz microwave signal, whose phase exactly tracks that of the optical frequency standard (OFC), is generated via the optical frequency comb, yielding a frequency instability of 1.89 E-13@1 s and 5.27 E-14@1000 s in the electronic domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optical clock at Rb D2 line. These results offer a promising approach for the development of portable optical clock.</description>

      <title>Efficiency enhancement in regenerative amplifier free-electron lasers using a tapered undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in short wavelength free-electron lasers extending from the extreme ultraviolet through the x-ray regime have opened new avenues for industrial and research applications. A high-gain/low-Q oscillator, i.e., a regenerative amplifier free-electron laser (RAFEL), is one possible concept. In this paper, we present the first analysis of efficiency enhancement in a RAFEL with a long, tapered undulator line. For the present analysis, we consider a high average power EUV RAFEL at 13.5 nm and show that the performance exceeds that of single-pass, tapered self-amplified spontaneous emission. This points the way to high power tapered undulator x-ray RAFELs.</description>

      <title>Microchip semiconductor membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first microchip semiconductor membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser. This compact type of laser consists solely of a semiconductor gain region present as a micron-thin membrane, sandwiched between two transparent heat spreaders. The heat spreaders have a highly reflective coating on their outer facets, which assembles the laser's plane-parallel solid-state cavity with a total length of just ~ 1 mm. One of the coatings with slightly reduced reflectivity acts as outcoupling mirror. The microchip membrane external-cavity surface-emitting laser (microchip MECSEL) is optically pumped with a standard fiber-coupled diode laser module emitting at 808 nm and stabilizes itself due to an occurring thermal lens. More than one watt of continuous wave output power around 1123 nm and a record value in fitted slope efficiency of ~ 51.4% with MECSELs, while maintaining excellent beam quality (TEM00, M^2 &lt; 1.05), is demonstrated. Important properties of semiconductor lasers such as the efficiency, beam quality, and polarization were investigated. Further, this setup was used to characterize the thermal lens and it's dependence on the absorbed pump power in the microchip MECSEL. Such systems represent an attractive solution, when high-power output at customizable emission wavelength with excellent beam quality is needed in combination with very compact built size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and performance analysis of relay lenses that provide high-performance image transmission for target acquisition and tracking in military optical systems. Relay lenses are critical components for clear and lossless image transmission over long distances. In this study, the optical performance of a relay lens system designed and optimized using ZEMAX software is investigated in detail. The analysis focuses on important optical properties such as modulation transfer function (MTF), spot diagrams, Seidel diagram, field curvature and distortion. The results show that the lens has significant potential in military applications for target detection and tracking with high resolution and low aberration.</description>

      <title>Developing a practical model for noise in entangled photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive model for the effective two-photon density matrix produced by a parametric source of entangled photon pairs under a variety of detector configurations commonly seen in a laboratory setting: two and four photon number-resolving (PNR) and threshold detectors. We derive the probability of obtaining a single coincidence assuming Poisson-distributed photon pairs, non-unit detection efficiency, and dark counts; obtain the effective density matrix; and use this quantity to compute the fidelity of the generated quantum state. The 4 PNR case admits an analytic result valid for any combination of parameters, while all other cases leverage low-efficiency approximations to arrive at closed-form expressions. Interestingly, our model reveals appreciable fidelity improvements from four detectors as opposed to two yet minimal advantages for PNR over threshold detectors in the regimes explored. Overall, our work provides a valuable tool for the quantitative design of two-photon experiments under realistic nonidealities.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels have limitations such as slow, labor-intensive, high-cost installation, and interruptive to solar field operations. Here we present a rapid, cost-effective, user-friendly and non-intrusive Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS) detection method. The PIMS imaging device is very compact and can be integrated on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for single-shot measurement of large area measurement on Heliostat mirrors for fast soiling detection without labor-intensive inspection of each heliostat with a reflectometer. With skylight as a natural light source, we developed a methodology to correlate Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) image of mirrors to their soiling levels using an experimentally calibrated model based on Mie Scattering Theory and Monte-Carlo simulation. For field deployment of the PIMS method, minimal pre-installation is required, and the field operation is not interrupted by the UAV imaging process. The PIMS method has significant potential for deployment in various concentration solar-thermal power (CSP) plants, offering high speed, non-interruptive mirror soiling detection. Moreover, the method can be further developed for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic troughs, solar panels, etc.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matrix elements of the position operator in the crystal momentum representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fewer operators are more fundamental than the position operator in a crystal. But since it is not translationally invariant in crystal momentum representation (CMR), how to properly represent it is nontrivial. Over half a century, various methods have been proposed, but they often lead to either highly singular derivatives or extremely arcane expressions. Here we propose a resolution to this problem by directly computing their matrix elements between two Bloch states. We show that the position operator is a full matrix in CMR, where the off-diagonal elements in crystal momentum $\bf k$ only appear along the direction of the position vector. Our formalism, free of singular derivative and degeneracy difficulties, can describe an array of physical properties, from intraband transitions, polarization with or without spin-orbit coupling, orbital angular momentum, to susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Light Interaction With a Space-Time-Modulated Josephson Junction Array and Application to Angular-Frequency Beam Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions, as pivotal components of modern technologies such as superconducting quantum computing, owe their prominence to their unique nonlinear properties at low temperatures. Despite their extensive use in static configurations, the study of dynamic Josephson junctions, particularly under space-time modulation, remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the interaction and transmission of electromagnetic waves through arrays of space-time-modulated Josephson junctions. A comprehensive mathematical framework is presented to model the propagation of electric and magnetic fields within and beyond these structures. We demonstrate how such dynamic arrays enable groundbreaking four-dimensional light manipulation, achieving angular-frequency beam multiplexing through a seamless integration of frequency conversion and beam-splitting functionalities. These advancements open new horizons for electromagnetic field engineering, with far-reaching implications for superconducting quantum technologies, next-generation wireless communications, biomedical sensing, and radar systems.</description>

      <title>A stable phase-locking-free single beam optical lattice with multiple configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices formed by interfering laser beams are widely used to trap and manipulate atoms for quantum simulation, metrology, and computation. To stabilize optical lattices in experiments, it is usually challenging to implement delicate phase-locking systems with complicated optics and electronics to reduce the relative phase fluctuation of multiple laser beams. Here we report a phase-locking-free scheme to implement optical lattices by passing a single laser beam through a prism with n-fold symmetric facets and large apex angles. The scheme ensures a stable optical lattice since the interference occurs among different deflected parts of a single laser beam without any moving component. Various lattice configurations, including a triangular lattice and a quasi-crystal lattice with ten-fold symmetry are demonstrated. In both cases, stability measurements show a change of lattice constant in less than 1.14%, and a drift of lattice position in less than 1.61%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, the prominent strategies for controlling spontaneous emission has been the use of resonant or space-periodic photonic structures. This approach, initially articulated by Purcell and later expanded by Bykov and Yablonovitch in the context of photonic crystals, leverages the spatial surroundings to modify the spontaneous emission decay rate of atoms or quantum emitters. However, the rise of time-varying photonics has compelled a reevaluation of the spontaneous emission process within dynamically changing environments, especially concerning photonic temporal crystals where optical properties undergo time-periodic modulation. Here, we apply classical light-matter interaction theory along with Floquet analysis to reveal a substantial enhancement in the spontaneous emission decay rate at the momentum gap frequency in photonic temporal crystals. This enhancement is attributed to time-periodicity-induced loss and gain mechanisms, as well as the non-orthogonality of Floquet eigenstates that are inherent to photonic temporal crystals. Intriguingly, our findings also suggest that photonic temporal crystals enable a non-equilibrium light-matter interaction process: the spontaneous excitation of an atom from its ground state to an excited state, accompanied by the concurrent emission of a photon, referred to as spontaneous emission excitation.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Chain: A Simple Model for Universal Description of Excitation of Waveguiding Modes in Thin Films</title>

Abstract: There is no simple and universal analytical description of various micro-optical schemes related with Fano resonances. This especially concern modulated thin films, which, when coupled to a continuum, show Fano resonances. Usually, such micro-optic circuits are simulated numerically, frequently by the use of commercial software. We fill this gap of the lack of universal analytical description by introducing and exploring a simple mechanical equivalent, the oscillator chain, which mimic such schemes involving Fano resonances. The model does not necessary provide the rigorous description of complicated micro-optical schemes, however does capture the main properties of such Fano-related micro-optical systems. The model captures different modifications of thin film: thin film with amplification, non-Hermitical thin films, and others. It also covers the case of multiple Fano resonances in a thin film. The model is compared with the rigorously calculated (Rigorous Coupled Wave analysis) wave propagation in the thin films.</description>

      <title>The Hall effects of vortex light in optical materials</title>

Abstract: For light, its spin can be independent of the spatial distribution of its wave function, whereas its intrinsic orbital angular momentum does depend on this distribution. This difference suggests that the spin Hall effect might differ from the orbital Hall effect as light propagates through optical materials. In this paper, we model optical materials as curved spacetime and investigate light propagation in two specific materials by solving the covariant Maxwell equations. We find that the trajectory of light with spin $\sigma$ and intrinsic orbital angular momentum $\ell$ deviates from that of light without angular momentum ($\sigma=0$ and $\ell=0$) by an angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell} \propto 2\sigma+\ell$. Notably, the contribution of spin $\sigma$ to the angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell}$ is twice that of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum $\ell$, highlighting their differing effects on light propagation in optical materials. Additionally, this angle $\theta_{\sigma,\ell}$ could potentially be observed experimentally, enhancing our understanding of the role of angular momentum in light propagation.</description>

      <title>Doped and structured silica optical fibres for fibre laser sources</title>

Abstract: Specialty optical fibres, usually the silica-based ones doped with rare-earth ions, have been heart of fibre amplifiers and lasers spread thanks to work of team of Sir David N. Payne started in 1980-ies of 20th century. Wavelength of their emission depends on used rare earth, on glass matrix in which the rare earths are incorporated, on fibre structure in macro, micro and nano scale, and fibre laser architecture. Usually, fibre lasers are operated at single wavelength. A typical example is an erbium fibre laser (erbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1550 nm or ytterbium fibre laser (ytterbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1060 nm. When erbium and ytterbium ions together are randomly distributed in a silica glass matrix and pumped at absorption band of ytterbium, laser emission is typically obtained only at 1550 nm (emission of erbium) thanks to energy transfer from ytterbium to erbium ions, supported by modification of silica glass matrix with phosphorous pentoxide. However, when erbium and ytterbium ions are specifically structured in micro or nano scale in the fibre core it is possible to obtain dual-wavelength laser operation with controlled output parameters. Such dual-wavelength operation with controlled output at 1042 nm and simultaneously at 1550 nm was demonstrated with structured core Er3+ and Yb3+-doped fibre. The proposed approach makes fabrication of active fibres emitting with controlled characteristics at more wavelengths possible.</description>

      <title>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubit generation via approximate squeezed coherent state superposition breeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement-based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement-based methods can produce high-quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement-based methods, while still producing states with high fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin modes and fixed-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>
