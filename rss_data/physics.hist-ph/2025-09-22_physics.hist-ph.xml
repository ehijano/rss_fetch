      <title>Der Stern von Bethlehem -- Einige Theorien und Hintergruende: Von der altorientalischen Astrologie ueber Kepler zu Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding "geocentric" and "heliocentric" world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.</description>

      <title>Dualities in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.</description>

      <title>A Timeless Game: A Game-Theoretic Model of Mass-Geometry Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal, timeless game-theoretic representation of the mass-geometry relation. An "Object" (mass) and "Space" (geometry) choose strategies in a static normal-form game; utilities encode stability as mutual consistency rather than dynamical payoffs. In a 2x2 toy model, the equilibria correspond to "light-flat" and "heavy-curved" configurations; a continuous variant clarifies when only trivial interior equilibria appear versus a continuum along a matching ray. Philosophically, the point is representational: a global description may be static while the experience of temporal flow for embedded observers arises from informational asymmetry, coarse-graining, and records. The framework separates time as parameter from relational constraint without committing to specific physical dynamics.</description>
