      <title>The dispersion measure and rotation measure from fast radio burst host galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG50 simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRB) will become important cosmological tools, as the number of observed FRBs is increasing rapidly with more surveys being carried out. A large sample of FRBs with dispersion measures (DM) and rotation measures (RM) can be used to study the intergalactic magnetic field. However, the observed DM and RM of FRBs have multiple contributors which must be quantified to obtain the intergalactic medium's (IGM) DM and RM. In this paper, we estimate one such contribution to DM and RM: that of FRB host galaxies. We show how it changes with redshift, galaxy type, and the stellar mass of the galaxies, inclination, and FRB's projected offset. Using the IllustrisTNG50 simulations, we selected 16500 galaxies at redshifts of 0&lt;=z&lt;=2, with stellar masses in the range 9&lt;=log(M*/Msun)&lt;=12. In each galaxy, we calculate the DM and RM contributions of 1000 sightlines, and construct DM and RM probability density functions. We find that the rest frame DM distributions of all galaxies at a given redshift can be fitted by a lognormal function, and the rest frame RM distribution is symmetric around 0 rad m$^{-2}$, and can be fitted by the combination of a Lorentzian and two Gaussian functions. The parameters of these functions change for different subsets of galaxies with different redshift, stellar mass, inclination, and FRB offset. These changes are due to an increasing $n_e$ with redshift, SFR, and stellar mass, and we find a more ordered B field at lower z compared to higher z, suggested by more galaxies with B field reversals and B fields dominated by random B field at higher z. We estimate the FRB host DM and RM contributions, which can be used in the future to isolate the IGM's contribution from the observed DM and RM of FRBs. We predict that to constrain an $\sigma_{\rm RM,IGM}$ of 2 rad m$^{-2}$ to 95% confidence level we need to observe 95000 FRBs at z=0.5, but only 9500 FRBs at z=2.</description>

      <title>The stellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies suggests deviations from the collision-less cold dark matter paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the nature of dark matter (DM) stands as a primary objective in modern physics. Here we present evidence suggesting deviations from the collisionless Cold DM (CDM) paradigm. It arises from the radial distribution of stars in six Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies measured with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). After a trivial renormalization in size and central density, the six UFDs show the same stellar distribution, which happens to have a central plateau or core. Assuming spherical symmetry and isotropic velocities, the Eddington inversion method proves the observed distribution to be inconsistent with potentials characteristic of CDM particles. Under such assumptions, the observed innermost slope of the stellar profile discards the UFDs to reside in a CDM potential at a &gt; 97% confidence level. The extremely low stellar mass of these galaxies, 10**3-10**4 Msun , prevents stellar feedback from modifying the shape of a CDM potential. Other conceivable explanations for the observed cores, like deviations from spherical symmetry and isotropy, tidal forces, and the exact form of the used CDM potential, are disfavored by simulations and/or observations. Thus, the evidence suggests that collisions among DM particles or other alternatives to CDM are likely shaping these galaxies. Many of these alternatives produce cored gravitational potentials, shown here to be consistent with the observed stellar distribution.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Milky Way spiral arms with 26Al -- The role of nova systems in the 2D distribution of 26Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are one of the most important and investigated astrophysical production sites of $^{26}$Al, a short-lived radioisotope with $\sim$ 1 Myr half-life. Its short lifetime prevents us from observing its complete chemical history, and only the $^{26}$Al that was recently produced by massive stars can be observed. Hence, it is considered a tracer of star formation rate (SFR). However, important contributions to $^{26}$Al comes from nova systems that pollute the interstellar medium with a large delay, thus partly erasing the correlation between $^{26}$Al and SFR. In this work we describe the 2D distribution of the mass of $^{26}$Al as well as that of massive stars and nova systems in the Milky Way, to investigate their relative contributions to the production of $^{26}$Al. We use a detailed 2D chemical evolution model where the SFR is azimuthally dependent and is required to reproduce the spiral arm pattern observed in the Milky Way. We test two different models, one where the $^{26}$Al comes from massive stars and novae, and one with massive stars only. We then compare the predictions to the $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{26}$Al mass observed by the surveys COMPTEL and INTEGRAL. The results show that novae do not trace SFR and, in the solar vicinity, they concentrate in its minima. The effect of novae on the map of the $^{26}$Al mass consists in damping the spiral pattern by a factor of five. Regarding the nucleosynthesis, we find that $\sim$75% of the $^{26}$Al is produced by novae and the $\sim$25% by massive stars. We conclude that novae cannot be neglected as $^{26}$Al producers since the observations can only be reproduced by including their contribution. Moreover, we suggest that bulge novae should eject around six times more material than the disc ones to well reproduce the observed mass of $^{26}$Al.</description>

      <title>A Sub-solar Fe/O, logT~7.5 Gas Component Permeating the Milky Way's CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study focuses on characterizing the highly ionized gas within the Milky Way's (MW) Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) that gives rise to ionic transitions in the X-ray band 2 - 25 \AA. Utilizing stacked \Chandra/\ACISS\ \MEG\ and \LETG\ spectra toward QSO sightlines, we employ the self-consistent hybrid ionization code PHASE to model our data. The stacked spectra are optimally described by three distinct gas phase components: a \warm\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 5.5), \warmhot\ (\logT\ $\sim 6$), and \hot\ (\logT\ $\sim$ 7.5) components. These findings confirm the presence of the \hot\ component in the MW's CGM indicating its coexistence with a \warm\ and a \warmhot\ gas phases. We find this \hot\ component to be homogeneous in temperature but inhomogeneous in column density. The gas in the \hot\ component requires over-abundances relative to solar to be consistent with the Dispersion Measure (DM) from the Galactic halo reported in the literature. {For the hot phase we estimated a DM = $55.1^{+29.9}_{-23.7}$ pc cm$^{-3}$}. We conclude that this phase is either enriched in Oxygen, Silicon, and Sulfur, or has metallicity {over 6} times solar value, or a combination of both. We do not detect Fe L-shell absorption lines, implying O/Fe $\geq$ 4. The non-solar abundance ratios found in the super-virial gas component in the Galactic halo suggest that this phase arises from Galactic feedback.</description>

      <title>Where is the Supervirial hot gas? I: A pilot study with sightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot, \logT\ $\sim$ 7.5, gas was recently discovered in the Milky Way in extragalactic sightlines. In order to determine its location, here we present sightlines to Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) passing through the Interstellar Medium (ISM). In this pilot study we investigate absorption features of \SXVI, \SiXIV, and \NeX\ in the spectra of three XRBs, namely 4U 1735-44, 4U 1820-30, and Cyg X-2, using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating archival observations. We do not detect any of these lines. {We determine the 2$\sigma$ upper limit for the equivalent widths of the undetected absorption lines and the column densities of the corresponding ions.} We note that the 2$\sigma$ upper limits for \SXVI\ \Ka\ and \SiXIV\ \Ka\ are an order of magnitude smaller than those previously detected in the extragalactic sightlines. Our finding suggests that if any gas at \logT\ $&gt;7$ is present in the Galactic ISM, it is unlikely to be ubiquitous. This is an important result because it implies that \SXVI, \SiXIV\ {and \NeX\ }absorption detected in extragalactic sightlines is not from the ISM, but is likely from a hot gas phase in the extraplanar region beyond the ISM or in the extended CGM.</description>

      <title>The rich galactic environment of a H$_2$-absorption selected quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first VLT/MUSE observations of a quasar featuring a proximate molecular absorption system, SDSS J125917.31+030922.5. The proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption acts as a natural coronagraph, removing the quasar emission over $\sim$40~{\AA} in wavelength, and allows us to detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission without the necessity of subtracting the quasar emission. This natural coronagraph permits the investigation of the quasar environment down to its inner regions ($r &lt; 20$ kpc), where galaxy interactions or feedback processes should have the most noticeable effects. Our observations reveal a dense environment, with a highly asymmetric Ly$\alpha$ emission within $2"$ ($\sim 15$ kpc), possibly shaped by a companion galaxy, and a southern extension of the nebulae at about 50~kpc, with rotation-like kinematic signature. The width of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is broadest closer to the quasar, indicating perturbed kinematics as expected if interactions and significant gas flows are present. The foreground absorbing system itself is redshifted by $\approx $400 km/s relative to the background quasar, and therefore is likely arising from gas moving towards the quasar. Finally two additional Ly$\alpha$ emitters are detected with $&gt;10\,\sigma$ significance at 96 and 223 kpc from the quasar, making this field overdense relative to other similar observations of quasars at $z\sim 3$. Our results support the hypothesis that quasars with proximate neutral/molecular absorption trace rich environments where galaxy interactions are at play and motivates further studies of H$_2$-selected quasars to shed light on feeding and feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ imaging around the hyperluminous dust-obscured quasar W2246$-$0526 at $z=4.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyperluminous, heavily obscured quasars discovered by the \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (\emph{WISE}) all-sky survey at high redshift. Observations suggested the growth of these galaxies may be driven by mergers. Previous environmental studies have statistically shown Hot DOGs may reside in dense regions. Here we use the Very Large Telescope (VLT) narrowband and broadband imaging to search for Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in the 6.8' * 6.8' field of the Hot DOG W2246$-$0526 at $z=4.6$. W2246$-$0526 is the most distant Hot DOG. We find that there is an overdensity of LAEs in W2246$-$0526 field compared with the blank fields. This is the direct evidence that this most distant Hot DOG is in an overdense environment on the Mpc scale, and the result relates to the merger origin of Hot DOGs.</description>

      <title>ACA CO(J=2-1) Mapping of the Nearest Spiral Galaxy M33. II. Exploring the Evolution of Giant Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the main sites of high-mass star formation, is an essential process to unravel the galaxy evolution. Using a GMC catalogue of M33 from ALMA-ACA survey, we classified 848 GMCs into three types based on the association with HII regions and their H$\alpha$ luminosities $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$): Type I is associated with no HII regions; Type II with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $&lt;$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$; and Type III with HII regions of $\textit{L}$(H$\alpha$) $\geqq$ 10$^{37.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These criteria yield 224 Type I GMCs, 473 Type II GMCs, and 151 Type III GMCs. GMCs show changes in their physical properties according to the types; mass, radius, velocity dispersion, and $^{13}$CO detection rate of GMCs systematically increase from Type I to Type III, and additionally, Type III GMCs are closest to virial equilibrium. Type III GMCs show the highest spatial correlation with clusters younger than 10 Myr, Type II GMCs moderate correlation, and Type I GMCs are almost uncorrelated. We interpret that these types indicate an evolutionary sequence from Type I to Type II, and then to Type III with timescales of 4 Myr, 13 Myr, and 5 Myr, respectively, indicating the GMC lifetime of 22 Myr by assuming that Type II GMC has the same timescale as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The evolved GMCs concentrate on the spiral arms, while the younger GMCs are apart from the arm both to the leading and trailing sides. This indicated that GMCs collide with each other by the spiral potential, leading to the compression of GMCs and the triggering of high-mass star formation, which may support the dynamic spiral model. Overall, we suggest that the GMC evolution concept helps illuminate the galaxy evolution, including the spiral arm formation.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Low-mass End of the Mass-Metallicity Relation at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and provides strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use JWST NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at $z=6-8$. Thanks to strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between $10^{6}$ and $10^{8} M_{\odot}$. Using strong lines diagnostics and the most recent JWST calibrations, we derive extremely-low oxygen abundances ranging from 12+log(O/H)=6.7 to 7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12+{\rm log(O/H)}=$0.39_{-0.02}^{+0.02} \times$ log(\mstar) $+ 4.52_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$, which is steeper than determinations at $z \sim 3$. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of highly stochastic star formation and ISM enrichment, expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high-$z$ dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Damped Ly$\alpha$ Absorber in the Circumnuclear Zone of the FeLoBAL Quasar SDSS J083942.11+380526.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 ($z=2.315$) is a FeLoBAL quasar that exhibits visible Balmer absorption lines (H$\alpha$), implying a significant $n=2$ population. The quasar also shows an array of absorption lines, including \oi, \niii, \feii, \mgii, \aliii\, to \civ\ and \nv. The high-ionization absorption lines such as \civ\ and \siiv\ are revealed by slightly blueshifted BAL troughs. The resonance doublets such as \mgii\ and \aliii\ are saturated but did not reached zero intensity which indicates that the BLR is partially covered. Overall, however, the absorption is predominantly from low-ionization \feii\ lines, emitted from ground and excited states up to at least 3.814 eV. This implies that the absorbing gas spans the hydrogen ionization front and extends into the partially ionized zone where neutral hydrogen is certainly present. Notably, the hydrogen line spectrum of the quasar shows no signature of expected Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Instead, the line spectrum shows an unusual Ly$\alpha$ emission characterized by a fully filled emission line spectrum which is a composite of a strong narrow core superposed on a weak broad base. Taking into account the effect of partial covering to BLR, we have extracted a strong DLA trough in Ly$\alpha$ emission region. To fit the spectrum, we performed photoionized model calculations and compared them to the observations. We found that photoionization modeling using CLOUDY can successfully reproduce the main characteristics of the quasar spectrum, and the predicted neutral hydrogen column density arising from the clouds responsible for the low-ionization absorption provides a good match to the extracted DLA trough. This indicates that both the DLA and the low-ionization absorption arise from the same medium that is roughly collocated with the dusty torus.</description>

      <title>Massive Quiescent Disk Galaxies at $0.5\ {\leq}\ z\ {\leq}\ 1$ in CANDELS : Color Gradients and Likely Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rare population of massive disk-dominated quiescent galaxies has recently drawn much attention, which intrudes the red sequence population without destroying the underlying stellar disks. In this study, we have carefully identified 48 red sequence (RS), disk-dominated galaxies with $M_{\ast} &gt; 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ between redshift 0.5 and 1.0 in all five CANDELS fields. These galaxies are well fitted by a two-component bulge plus disk model, and have the bulge-to-total ratio $B/T&lt;0.4$ in the both F814W and F160W bands. The fitting results indicate that these galaxies generally have extended stellar disks ($\rm \sim 3~kpc$ on average) and tiny bulge components ($\rm \sim 0.5~kpc$ on average). To understand their possible origins, we have also selected two control samples of 156 green valley (GV) and 309 blue cloud (BC) disk-dominated galaxies according to the same selection criteria. We study the $UVI$($U-V$ versus $V-I$) color gradients of these galaxies to infer their specific star formation rate (sSFR) gradients out to the maximum acceptable radii. We show that on average the disks in disk-dominated RS galaxies are fully quenched at all radii, whereas both the BC and GV disks are not fully quenched at any radii. We find that all the BC, GV and RS disk galaxies generally have nearly flat sSFR profiles. We propose a potential formation mechanism, acknowledging that various other mechanisms (e.g., central compaction and AGN feedback) might contribute, where massive quiescent disk-dominated galaxies are predominantly formed via a process of secular disk fading.</description>

Abstract: Extended [CII] emission on tens of kpc, also known as a [CII] halo, is being currently reported around z$\sim$4-6 star-forming galaxies, especially thanks to the statistics of the ALPINE survey. The [CII] emission is expected to trace dense cold gas in the inner CGM of these galaxies. The origin of this emission is still debated. In this paper, we present a post-processing model applied to Illustris-TNG50 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim$4-6, and we compare our results with the ALPINE observations. By incorporating C$^{+}$ abundances derived from UV background and young stars as radiation sources, we generate mock observations, from which we extract surface-brightness (SB) profiles. We found that our model predicts similar [CII] emission values on galactic scales as the observations, providing validation for our approach. However, we find that the predicted [CII] emission in the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) falls below the observed values by a factor of $\sim$10. We discuss several model limitations that may contribute to this discrepancy. We also find discrepancies with observations when comparing SB profiles of low and high-SFR galaxies. Unlike the observations, simulations exhibit no discernible difference in the extended [CII] emission between the two subsamples. This discrepancy may reflect shortcomings in feedback model of the simulation. Finally, our analysis suggests that the extended [CII] emission is likely a result of both gas from satellite galaxies and outflows from central galaxies, with satellites playing a dominant role within 0.6$&lt;$R/R$_{\rm vir}&lt;$1. A firm estimate of the importance of each contribution is beyond the scope of the current simulations.</description>

      <title>Strong Balmer break objects at z ~ 7-10 uncovered with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts $7.1 \le z \le 9.6$ from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not strongly depend on the rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>

      <title>Variable Star Light Curves in Koopman Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of data-driven techniques for dynamical system analysis based on Koopman theory to variable stars. We focus on light curves of RRLyrae type variables, in the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Light curves are thus summarized by a handful of complex eigenvalues, corresponding to oscillatory or fading dynamical modes. We find that variable stars of the RRc subclass can be summarized in terms of fewer ($\approx 8$) eigenvalues, while RRab need comparatively more ($\approx 12$). This result can be leveraged for classification and reflects the simpler structure of RRc light curves. We then consider variable stars displaying secular variations due to the Tseraskaya-Blazhko effect and find a change in relevant eigenvalues with time, with possible implications for the physical interpretation of the effect.</description>

      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-2609Lb and KMT-2022-BLG-0303Lb: Microlensing planets identified through signals produced by major-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate microlensing data collected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of two lensing events, KMT-2021-BLG-2609 and KMT-2022-BLG-0303, exhibit a similar anomaly, in which short-term positive deviations appear on the sides of the low-magnification lensing light curves. To unravel the nature of these anomalies, we meticulously analyze each of the lensing events. Our investigations reveal that these anomalies stem from a shared channel, wherein the source passed near the planetary caustic induced by a planet with projected separations from the host star exceeding the Einstein radius. We find that interpreting the anomaly of KMT-2021-BLG-2609 is complicated by the "inner--outer" degeneracy, whereas for KMT-2022-BLG-0303, there is no such issue despite similar lens-system configurations. In addition to this degeneracy, interpreting the anomaly in KMT-2021-BLG-2609 involves an additional degeneracy between a pair of solutions, in which the source partially envelops the caustic and the other three solutions in which the source fully envelopes the caustic. As in an earlier case of this so-called von Schlieffen--Cannae degeneracy, the former solutions have substantially higher mass ratio. Through Bayesian analyses conducted based on the measured lensing observables of the event time scale and angular Einstein radius, the host of KMT-2021-BLG-2609L is determined to be a low-mass star with a mass $\sim 0.2~M_\odot$ in terms of a median posterior value, while the planet's mass ranges from approximately 0.032 to 0.112 times that of Jupiter, depending on the solutions. For the planetary system KMT-2022-BLG-0303L, it features a planet with a mass of approximately $0.51~M_{\rm J}$ and a host star with a mass of about $0.37~M_\odot$. In both cases, the lenses are most likely situated in the bulge.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m\lesssim10^{-20}$ eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m&lt;1.5\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\sigma$ confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors $m&lt;5\times10^{-22}$ eV ($2\sigma$). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.</description>

      <title>A second view on the X-ray polarization of NGC 4151 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the second observing program of the active galactic nucleus NGC 4151 with simultaneous Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE; {\sim}750 ks), NuSTAR ({\sim}60 ks), XMM-Newton ({\sim}75 ks), and NICER ({\sim}65 ks) pointings. NGC 4151 is the first Type 1 radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy with constrained polarization properties for the X-ray corona. Despite the lower flux state in which the source is re-observed and the resulting higher contribution of the constant reflection component in the IXPE energy band, our results are in agreement with the first detection. From the polarimetric analysis, a polarization degree {\Pi} = 4.7 {\pm} 1.3 per cent and angle {\Psi} = 77{\deg} {\pm} 8{\deg} east of north (68 per cent confidence level) are derived in the 2.0 - 8.0 keV energy range. Combining the two observations leads to polarization properties that are more constrained than those of the individual detections, showing {\Pi} = 4.5 {\pm} 0.9 per cent and {\Psi} = 81{\deg} {\pm} 6{\deg} (with detection significance {\sim}4.6{\sigma}). The observed polarization angle aligns very well with the radio emission in this source, supporting, together with the significant polarization degree, a slab or wedge geometry for the X-ray corona. However, a switch in the polarization angle at low energies (37{\deg} {\pm} 7{\deg} in the 2 - 3.5 keV bin) suggests the presence of another component. When it is included in the spectro-polarimetric fit, a high polarization degree disfavors an interpretation in terms of a leakage through the absorbers, rather pointing to scattering from some kind of mirror.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in asymptotic giant branch stars and their winds. I. From 3D RHD models to synthetic observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] AGB stars are significant contributors to the metal enrichment of the interstellar medium. In this paper, we adapted models from advanced RHD simulations as input for radiative transfer software to create synthetic observables. A major goal is to describe an AGB star's non-sphericity and to simulate its effects on the surrounding dusty envelope. We developed tools to translate models of an AGB star and its dust-driven wind from simulations with CO5BOLD into the format used by RADMC-3D. We preserved the asymmetric shape of the star by including it as a `dust species' and by using temperature data computed in CO5BOLD. Circumstellar dust is included using Mg2SiO4 opacity data with spatially dependent grain sizes. We compared images and SEDs created with RADMC-3D of a model with similar output made with a spherically symmetric star. Our CO5BOLD model features substantial and clumpy dust formation just above 3.4 au from the grid centre, and large-scale structures due to giant convection cells are visible on the stellar surface. With the properties of VLTI as a basis, we have created simple synthetic observables. Such optical interferometers should be able to detect these dust clouds. We find that it is important to include asymmetric stellar models since they even affect the SEDs. Effects on flux levels can be linked to the clumpiness of the circumstellar dust and the angle-dependent illumination resulting from temperature variations on the stellar surface causes shifts in the wavelengths of the flux maximum. The methods presented here are an important step towards producing realistic synthetic observables and testing predictions of advanced 3D RHD models. Taking the angle-dependence of SEDs as a proxy for temporal variations in unresolved data, we conclude that not all variability observed in AGB stars should be interpreted as global changes in the sense of spherical models.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stellar intrinsic colors and dust reddenings for spectro-photometric data: From the blue-edge method to a machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for the studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict the ICs with the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, ${\rm log}\,g$, and $\rm [M/H]$. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and 2MASS bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 GSP-phot module and were validated by comparing with APOGEE and LAMOST. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for $\rm [M/H]$, do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})_0$, 0.050 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$, and 0.040 mag for $(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$. The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from Andrae et al. (2023) to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of $E(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})$ between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of $E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})/E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})$, a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and the accuracy of the machine-learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectro-photometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12787594}. The models for more bands will be completed in the following works.</description>

      <title>Constraints on galaxy formation from the cosmic-far-infrared-background\,$-$\,optical-imaging cross-correlation using \textit{Herschel} and UNIONS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using {\it Herschel}-SPIRE imaging and the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS) Low Surface Brightness data products from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we present a cross-correlation between the cosmic far-infrared background and cosmic optical background fluctuations. The cross-spectrum is measured for two cases: all galaxies are kept in the images; or all individually-detected galaxies are masked to produce `background' maps. We report the detection of the cross-correlation signal at $\gtrsim 18\,\sigma$ ($\gtrsim 14\,\sigma$ for the background map). The part of the optical brightness variations that are correlated with the submm emission translates to an rms brightness of $\simeq 32.5\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ in the $r$ band, a level normally unreachable for individual sources. A critical issue is determining what fraction of the cross-power spectrum might be caused by emission from Galactic cirrus. For one of the fields, the Galactic contamination is 10 times higher than the extragalactic signal; however, for the other fields, the contamination is around 20~per cent. An additional discriminant is that the cross-power spectrum is of the approximate form $P(k)\propto 1/k$, much shallower than that of Galactic cirrus. We interpret the results in a halo-model framework, which shows good agreement with independent measurements for the scalings of star-formation rates in galaxies. The approach presented in this study holds great promise for future surveys such as FYST/CCAT-prime combined with {\it Euclid} or the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST), which will enable a detailed exploration of the evolution of star formation in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing by AGNs as a probe of the quasar-host relations in the distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tight correlations found between masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the luminosities, total stellar masses, and velocity dispersions of their host galaxies are often interpreted as a sign of their co-evolution. Studying these correlations across redshift provides a powerful insight into the evolutionary path followed by the quasar and its host galaxy. While the mass of the black hole is accessible from single-epoch spectra, measuring the mass of its host galaxy is challenging as the active nucleus largely overshines its host. Here, we present a technique to probe quasar-host relations beyond the local universe with strong gravitational lensing, hence overcoming the use of stellar population models or velocity dispersion measurements, both prone to degeneracies. We study in detail one of the three known cases of strong lensing by a quasar to accurately measure the mass of its host and to infer a total lensing mass of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm Tot, h}/M_{\odot}) = 10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}~$ within the Einstein radius of 1.2 kpc. The lensing measurement is more precise than any other alternative technique and compatible with the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{\star, h}$ scaling relation. The sample of such quasar-galaxy or quasar-quasar lensing systems should reach a few hundreds with Euclid and Rubin-LSST, thus enabling the application of such a method with statistically significant sample sizes.</description>

We construct a detailed forward model for the COSMOS data, comprising: a population model describing the joint distribution of galaxy characteristics and its evolution (parameterized by a flexible score-based diffusion model); a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis (SPS) model connecting galaxies' instrinsic properties to their photometry; and a data-model for the observation, calibration and selection processes. By minimizing the optimal transport distance between synthetic and real data we are able to jointly fit the population- and data-models, leading to robustly calibrated population-level inferences that account for parameter degeneracies, photometric noise and calibration, and selection. We present a number of key predictions from our model of interest for cosmology and galaxy evolution, including the mass function and redshift distribution; the mass-metallicity-redshift and fundamental metallicity relations; the star-forming sequence; the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass, star formation rate and attenuation-law index; and the relation between gas-ionization and star formation. Our model encodes a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution that faithfully predicts galaxy colors across a broad redshift ($z&lt;4$) and wavelength range.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO simulation view of cluster progenitors observed in the epoch of reionization with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent JWST discovery of galaxy overdensities during the Epoch of Reionzation, we examine the physical properties of high-$z$ protoclusters and their evolution using the FLAMINGO simulation suite. We investigate the impact of the apertures used to define protoclusters, because the heterogeneous apertures used in the literature have limited our understanding of the population. Our results are insensitive to the uncertainties of the subgrid models at a given resolution, whereas further investigation into the dependence on numerical resolution is needed. When considering galaxies more massive than $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$, the FLAMINGO simulations predict a dominant contribution from progenitors similar to those of the Coma cluster to the cosmic star-formation rate density during the reionization epoch. Our results indicate the onset of suppression of star formation in the protocluster environments as early as $z\,{\simeq}\,5$. The galaxy number density profiles are similar to NFW at $z\,{\lesssim}\,1$ while showing a steeper slope at earlier times before the formation of the core. Different from most previous simulations, the predicted star-formation history for individual protoclusters is in good agreement with observations. We demonstrate that, depending on the aperture, the integrated physical properties including the total (dark matter and baryonic) mass can be biased by a factor of 2 to 5 at $z\,{=}\,5.5$--$7$, and by an order of magnitude at $z\,{\lesssim}\,4$. This correction suffices to remove the ${\simeq}\,3\,\sigma$ tensions with the number density of structures found in recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023; Mercier et al. 2024) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts. Scale invariance appears to release or even suppress the need for dark matter.</description>

      <title>AXES-2MRS: A new all-sky catalogue of extended X-ray galaxy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new all-sky catalogue of X-ray detected groups (AXES-2MRS), based on the identification of large X-ray sources found in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) with the Two Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) Bayesian Group Catalogue. We study the basic properties of these galaxy groups to gain insights into the effect of different group selections on the properties. In addition to X-ray luminosity coming from shallow survey data of RASS, we have obtained detailed X-ray properties of the groups by matching the AXES-2MRS catalogue to archival X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and complemented this by adding the published XMM-Newton results on galaxy clusters in our catalogue. We analyse temperature and density to the lowest overdensity accessible by the data, obtaining hydrostatic mass estimates and comparing them to the velocity dispersions of the groups. We find a large spread in the central mass to virial mass ratios for galaxy groups in the XMM-Newton subsample. This can either indicate large non-thermal pressure of galaxy groups affecting our X-ray mass measurements, or the effect of a diversity of halo concentrations on X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Previous catalogues, based on detecting the peak of the X-ray emission preferentially sample the high-concentration groups, while our new catalogue includes many low-concentration groups.

      <title>Galaxy Ages with Redshift z=2-4: Stellar Population Synthesis for Candidates in FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of large amount of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped SED non-AGN galaxies at redshifts $2&lt;z&lt;4$ of the catalog of FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by V-shape in their spectral energy distribution (SED) with a Lyman and a Balmer break. SED fitting include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with $z&gt;2.5$, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research find that most massive galaxies ($\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ ) are older (typically $&gt;\sim 1$ Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular emissions associated with MgII absorptions detected in the SDSS spectra of background quasars</title>

Abstract: We present long-slit spectroscopic observations of 40 Galaxy On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs) at ${0.37 \leqslant z \leqslant 1.01}$ using the South African Large Telescope. Using this and available photometric data, we measure the impact parameters of the foreground galaxies to be in the range of 3$-$16 kpc with a median value of 8.6 kpc. This is the largest sample of galaxies producing MgII absorption at such low impact parameters. These quasar-galaxy pairs are ideal for probing the disk-halo interface. At such impact parameters, we do not find any significant anti-correlation between rest equivalent width (REW) of CaII, MnII, FeII, MgII, and MgI absorptions and impact parameters. These sight lines are typically redder than those of strong MgII absorbers, with the color excess, E(B$-$V) for our sample ranging from $-$0.191 to 0.422, with a median value of 0.058. In the E(B$-$V) vs. W$_{3935}$ plane, GOTOQs occupy the same region as CaII absorbers. For a given E(B$-$V), we find larger W$_{3935}$ than what has been found in the Milky Way, probably due to a smaller dust-to-gas ratio in GOTOQs. Galaxy parameters could be measured for twelve cases, and their properties seem to follow the trends found for strong MgII absorbers. Measuring the host galaxy properties for the full sample using HST photometry or AO-assisted ground-based imaging is important to gain insights into the relationship between the stellar mass of galaxies and the metal line REW distributions at low impact parameters.</description>

      <title>Big Galaxies and Big Black Holes: The Massive Ends of the Local Stellar and Black Hole Mass Functions and the Implications for Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by combining the GSMF at stellar masses $M_* \lesssim 10^{11.3} M_\odot$ from the census study of Leja et al. (2020) and the GSMF of massive galaxies at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ from the volume-limited MASSIVE galaxy survey. To obtain a robust estimate of $M_*$ for local massive galaxies, we use MASSIVE galaxies with $M_*$ measured from detailed dynamical modeling or stellar population synthesis modeling (incorporating a bottom-heavy initial mass function) with high-quality spatially-resolved spectroscopy. These two independent sets of $M_*$ agree to within ${\sim}7$%. Our new $z=0$ GSMF has a higher amplitude at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ than previous studies, alleviating prior concerns of a lack of mass growth in massive galaxies between $z\sim 1$ and 0. We derive a local black hole mass function (BHMF) from this GSMF and the scaling relation of SMBH and galaxy masses. The inferred abundance of local SMBHs above $\sim 10^{10}M_\odot$ is consistent with the number of currently known systems. The predicted amplitude of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background is also consistent with the levels reported by Pulsar Timing Array teams. Our $z = 0$ GSMF therefore leads to concordant results in the high-mass regime of the local galaxy and SMBH populations and the gravitational wave amplitude from merging SMBHs. An exception is our BHMF yields a $z=0$ SMBH mass density that is notably higher than the value estimated from quasars at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Field-level Lyman-alpha forest modelling in redshift space via augmented non-local Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved analytical model to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in redshift space from the dark matter field, expanding upon the widely-used Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation (FGPA). In particular, we introduce the dependence on the cosmic web environment (knots, filaments, sheets, voids) in the model, thereby effectively accounting for non-local bias. Furthermore, we include a detailed treatment of velocity bias in the redshift space distortions modelling, allowing the velocity bias to be cosmic-web dependent. We find evidence for a significant difference of the same model parameters in different environments, suggesting that for the investigated setup the simple standard FGPA is not able to adequately predict the Lyman-alpha forest in the different cosmic web regimes. We reproduce the summary statistics of the reference cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we use for comparison, yielding accurate mean transmitted flux, probability distribution function, 3D power spectrum, and bispectrum. In particular, we achieve maximum deviation and average deviations accuracy in the Lyman-alpha forest 3D power spectrum of $\sim 3\%$ and $\sim 0.1\%$ up to $k\sim 0.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 1.8\%$ up to $k \sim 1.4 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our new model outperforms previous analytical efforts to predict the Lyman-alpha forest at the field level in all the probed summary statistics, and has the potential to become instrumental in the generation of fast accurate mocks for covariance matrices estimation in the context of current and forthcoming Lyman-alpha forest surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Dark Matter through Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of high-energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei (AGN), NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole and high-energy protons and electrons can cool efficiently via interactions with ambient photons and gas. The dark matter density may be significantly enhanced near the central black hole, and CRs could lose energies predominantly due to scatterings with the ambient dark matter particles. We propose CR cooling in AGN as a new probe of dark matter-proton and dark matter-electron scatterings. Under plausible astrophysical assumptions, our constraints on sub-GeV dark matter can be the strongest derived to date. Some of the parameter space favored by thermal light dark matter models might already be probed with current multimessenger observations of AGN.</description>

      <title>Image deconvolution and PSF reconstruction with STARRED: a wavelet-based two-channel method optimized for light-curve extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present STARRED, a Point Spread Function (PSF) reconstruction, two-channel deconvolution, and light curve extraction method designed for high-precision photometric measurements in imaging time series. An improved resolution of the data is targeted rather than an infinite one, thereby minimizing deconvolution artifacts. In addition, STARRED performs a joint deconvolution of all available data, accounting for epoch-to-epoch variations of the PSF and decomposing the resulting deconvolved image into a point source and an extended source channel. The output is a deep sharp frame combining all data, and the photometry of all point sources in the field of view as a function of time. Of note, STARRED also provides exquisite PSF models for each data frame. We showcase three applications of STARRED in the context of the imminent LSST survey and of JWST imaging: i) the extraction of supernovae light curves and the scene representation of their host galaxy, ii) the extraction of lensed quasar light curves for time-delay cosmography, and iii) the measurement of the spectral energy distribution of globular clusters in the "Sparkler", a galaxy at redshift z=1.378 strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. STARRED is implemented in JAX, leveraging automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. This enables rapid processing of large time-domain datasets, positioning the method as a powerful tool for extracting light curves from the multitude of lensed or unlensed variable and transient objects in the Rubin-LSST data, even when blended with intervening objects.</description>

      <title>The transient event in NGC 1566 from 2017 to 2019 -- I. An eccentric accretion disk and a turbulent, disk-dominated broad-line region unveiled by double-peaked Ca II and O I lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 1566 is known for exhibiting recurrent outbursts, which are accompanied by changes in spectral type. The most recent transient event occurred from 2017 to 2019 and was reported to be accompanied by a change in Seyfert classification from Seyfert 1.8 to Seyfert 1.2. We analyze data from an optical spectroscopic variability campaign of NGC 1566 taken with the 9.2m SALT between July 2018 and October 2019 and supplement our data set with optical to near-infrared spectroscopic archival data taken by VLT/MUSE in September 2015 and October 2017. We observe the emergence and fading of a strong power-law-like blue continuum as well as strong variations in the Balmer, HeI, HeII lines and the coronal lines [FeVII], [FeX] and [FeXI]. Moreover, we detect broad double-peaked emission line profiles of OI 8446 and the CaII 8498,8542,8662 triplet. This is the first time that genuine double-peaked OI 8446 and CaII 8498,8542,8662 emission in AGN is reported in the literature. All broad lines show a clear redward asymmetry with respect to their central wavelength and we find indications for a significant blueward drift of the total line profiles during the transient event. We show that the double-peaked emission line profiles are well approximated by emission from a low-inclination, relativistic eccentric accretion disk, and that single-peaked profiles can be obtained by broadening due to scale-height dependent turbulence. Small-scale features in the OI and CaII lines suggest the presence of inhomogeneities in the broad-line region. We conclude that the broad-line region in NGC 1566 is dominated by the kinematics of a relativistic eccentric accretion disk. The broad-line region can be modeled to be vertically stratified with respect to scale-height turbulence. The observed blueward drift might be attributed to a low-optical-depth wind launched during the transient event.</description>

      <title>Investigating the interplay between the coronal properties and the hard X-ray variability of active galactic nuclei with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are extremely variable in the X-ray band down to very short timescales. However, the driver behind the X-ray variability is still poorly understood. Previous results suggest that the hot corona responsible for the primary Comptonized emission observed in AGN is expected to play an important role in driving the X-ray variability. In this work, we investigate the connection between the X-ray amplitude variability and the coronal physical parameters; namely, the temperature ($kT$) and optical depth ($\tau$). We present the spectral and timing analysis of 46 {\it NuSTAR} observations corresponding to a sample of 20 AGN. For each source, we derived the coronal temperature and optical depth through X-ray spectroscopy and computed the normalized excess variance for different energy bands on a timescale of $10$ ks. We find a strong inverse correlation between $kT$ and $\tau$, with correlation coefficient of $r&lt;-0.9$ and negligible null probability. No clear dependence was found among the temperature and physical properties, such as the black hole mass or the Eddington ratio. We also see that the observed X-ray variability is not correlated with either the coronal temperature or optical depth under the thermal equilibrium assumption, whereas it is anticorrelated with the black hole mass. These results can be interpreted through a scenario where the observed X-ray variability could primarily be driven by variations in the coronal physical properties on a timescale of less than $10$~ks; whereas we assume thermal equilibrium on such timescales in this work, given the capability of the currently available hard X-ray telescopes. Alternatively, it is also possible that the X-ray variability is mostly driven by the absolute size of the corona, which depends on the supermassive black hole mass, rather than resulting from any of its physical properties.</description>
