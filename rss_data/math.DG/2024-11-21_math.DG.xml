      <description>arXiv:2411.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of generalized almost plastic structure, and, on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold endowed with two $(1,1)$-tensor fields satisfying some compatibility conditions, we construct a family of generalized almost plastic structures and characterize their integrability with respect to a given affine connection on the manifold.</description>

      <title>Stretch maps on the affine-additive group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define linear and radial stretch maps in the affine-additive group, and prove that they are minimizers of the mean quasiconformal distortion functional. For the proofs we use a method based on the notion of modulus of a curve family and the minimal stretching property (MSP) of the afore-mentioned maps. MSP relies on certain given curve families compatible with the respective geometric settings of the strech maps.</description>

      <title>Preserving curvature lower bounds when Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we survey some results on Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data. Among other things, we give a non-exhaustive list of various weak initial data which can be evolved with the Ricci flow. We also survey results which show that various curvature lower bounds will, possibly up to a constant, be preserved, if we start with such possibly non-smooth initial data. Some proofs/proof sketches are given in certain cases. A list of some open problems related to these areas is given in the last section of the paper.</description>

      <title>Twins in K{\"a}hler and Sasaki geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of weighted extremal K{\"a}hler twins together with the related notion of extremal Sasaki twins. In the K\"ahler setting this leads to a generalization of the twinning phenomenon appearing among LeBrun's strongly Hermitian solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations on the first Hirzebruch surface \cite{Leb16} to weighted extremal metrics on Hirzebruch surfaces in general. We discover that many twins appear and that this can be viewed in the Sasaki setting as a case where we have more than one extremal ray in the Sasaki cone even when we do not allow changes within the isotopy class. We also study extremal Sasaki twins directly in the Sasaki setting with a main focus on the toric Sasaki case.</description>

      <title>Graphs with Lin-Lu-Yau curvature at least one and regular bone-idle graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and its modification introduced by Lin, Lu, and Yau on graphs. We provide a complete characterization of all graphs with Lin-Lu-Yau curvature at least one. We then explore the relationship between the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature with vanishing idleness on regular graphs. An exact formula for the difference between these two curvature notions is established, along with an equality condition. This condition allows us to characterize edges that are bone-idle in regular graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-existence of 3-regular bone-idle graphs and present a complete characterization of all 4-regular bone-idle graphs. We also show that there exist no 5-regular bone-idle graphs that are symmetric or a Cartesian product of a 3-regular and a 2-regular graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>

      <title>Averages of determinants of Laplacians over moduli spaces for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. We view the regularized determinant $\log \det(\Delta_{X})$ of Laplacian as a function on $\mathcal{M}_g$ and show that there exists a universal constant $E&gt;0$ such that as $g\to \infty$,
  (1) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}-E \right|$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ has rate of decay $g^{-\delta}$ for some uniform constant $\delta \in (0,1)$;
  (2) the expected value of $\left|\frac{\log \det(\Delta_{X})}{4\pi(g-1)}\right|^\beta$ over $\mathcal{M}_g$ approaches to $E^\beta$ whenever $\beta \in [1,2)$.</description>

Abstract: We construct canonical measures, referred to as Hilbert measures, on orbit spaces of classical coregular representations of the orthogonal groups $\operatorname{O}_m$. We observe that the measures have singularities along non-principal strata of the orbit space if and only if the number of copies of the defining representation of $\operatorname{O}_m$ is equal to $m$.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Dirichlet, Neumann and Laplacian eigenvalues on graphs and their applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.04160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain some comparisons of the Dirichlet, Neumann and Laplacian eigenvalues on graphs. We also discuss their rigidities and some of their applications including some Lichnerowicz-type, Fiedler-type and Friedman-type estimates for Dirichlet eigenvalues and Neumann eigenvalues. The comparisons on Neumann eigenvalues can be translated to comparisons on Steklov eigenvalues in our setting. So, some of the results can be viewed as extensions for parts of the works of \cite{HHW} by Hua-Huang-Wang, and parts of our previous works \cite{SY,SY2}.</description>

      <title>On the Isoperimetric Riemannian Penrose Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10215v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Riemannian Penrose Inequality holds for Asymptotically Flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and connected horizon boundary, provided the optimal decay assumptions are met, which result in the $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass being a well-defined geometric invariant. Our proof builds on a novel interplay between the Hawking mass and a potential-theoretic version of it, recently introduced by Agostiniani, Oronzio and the third named author. As a consequence, we establish the equality between $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass and Huisken's Isoperimetric mass under the above sharp assumptions. Moreover, we establish a Riemannian Penrose Inequality in terms of the Isoperimetric mass on any $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature, connected horizon boundary, and which supports a well-posed notion of weak Inverse Mean Curvature Flow. In particular, such Isoperimetric Riemannian Penrose Inequality does not require the asymptotic flatness of the manifold. The argument is based on a new asymptotic comparison result involving Huisken's Isoperimetric mass and the Hawking mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any complete Riemannian manifold with negative part of the Ricci curvature in a suitable Dynkin class is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a finite-dimensional $\mathrm{RCD}$ space, by building upon the transformation rule of the Bakry-\'Emery condition under time change. We apply this result to show that our previous results on the limits of closed Riemannian manifolds satisfying a uniform Kato bound carry over to limits of complete manifolds. We also obtain a weak version of the Bishop-Gromov monotonicity formula for manifolds satisfying a strong Kato bound.</description>

      <title>Twisted Adiabatic Limit for Complex Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $X$ and a smooth positive function $\eta$ thereon, we perturb the standard differential operator $d=\partial + \bar\partial$ acting on differential forms to a first-order differential operator $D_\eta$ whose principal part is $\eta\partial + \bar\partial$. The role of the zero-th order part is to force the integrability property $D_\eta^2=0$ that leads to a cohomology isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of $X$, while the components of types $(0,\,1)$ and $(1,\,0)$ of $D_\eta$ induce cohomologies isomorphic to the Dolbeault and conjugate-Dolbeault cohomologies. We compute Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano-type formulae for the Laplacians induced by these operators and a given Hermitian metric on $X$. The computations throw up curvature-like operators of order one that can be made (semi-)positive under appropriate assumptions on the function $\eta$. As applications, we obtain vanishing results for certain harmonic spaces on complete, non-compact, manifolds and for the Dolbeault cohomology of compact complex manifolds that carry certain types of functions $\eta$. This study continues and generalises the one of the operators $d_h=h\partial + \bar\partial$ that we introduced and investigated recently for a positive constant $h$ that was then let to converge to $0$ and, more generally, for constants $h\in\C$. The operators $d_h$ had, in turn, been adapted to complex structures from the well-known adiabatic limit construction for Riemannian foliations. Allowing now for possibly non-constant functions $\eta$ creates positivity in the curvature-like operator that stands one in good stead for various kinds of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes attempt to invite the reader towards the theory of singular foliations, both smooth and holomorphic. In addition to a systematic review of the foundations, and an attempt to put in order examples and several elementary constructions, we detail several recent tools developed for non-commutative geometry, in particular the holonomy groupoid of Androulidakis and Skandalis and various methods for resolving singularities. We also introduce various homotopic notions, and end with a series of open questions.</description>
