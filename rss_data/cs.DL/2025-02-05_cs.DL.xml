      <title>Fostering Data Communities -- perspective from a Data Archive Service Provider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to bridge between the current scientific discourse about the dynamics of data communities in research infrastructures and practical experiences at a data archive which provides services for such data communities. We describe and analyse policies and practices within DANS-KNAW, the Dutch national centre of expertise and repository for research data concerning the interaction with communities in general. We take the case of the emerging DANS Data Station Life Sciences to study how a data archive navigates between observation of data research needs and anticipation of research data archival solutions. This paper offers a unique view of the complex dynamics between data communities (including lay experts) and data service providers. It adds nuances to understanding the emergence of a data community and the role of data service providers, both supporting and shaping, in this process.</description>

      <title>A comparison of citation-based clustering and topic modeling for science mapping</title>

Abstract: Understanding the different ways in which different science mapping approaches capture the structure of scientific fields is critical. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two commonly used approaches, topic modeling (TM) and citation-based clustering (CC), to assess their respective strengths, weaknesses, and the characteristics of their results. We compare the two approaches using cluster-to-topic and topic-to-cluster mappings based on science maps of cardiovascular research generated by TM and CC. Our findings reveal that relations between topics and clusters are generally weak, with limited overlap between topics and clusters. Only in a few exceptional cases do more than one-third of the documents in a topic belong to the same cluster, or vice versa. For TM the presence of highly similar topics is a considerable challenge. A strength of TM is its ability to represent societal needs related to cardiovascular disease, potentially offering valuable insights for policymakers. In contrast, CC excels in depicting the intellectual structure of cardiovascular diseases, with a strong capability to reflect scientific micro-communities. This study deepens the understanding of the use of TM and CC for science mapping, providing insights for users on how to apply these approaches based on their needs.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Data Management: Indefinite Static Data at Rest with Machine-Readable Printed Optical Data Sheets (MRPODS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era where both commercial and private sectors place a premium on the longevity of digital data storage, the imperative to bolster resilience of digital information while simultaneously curbing costs and reducing failure rates becomes paramount. This study delves into the unique attributes of optical encoding methodologies, which are poised to offer enduring stability for digital data. Despite their promising potential, there remains a notable dearth of comprehensive analyses comparing various optical encoding techniques in terms of their durability. This research is thus dedicated to exploring the financial and environmental implications of employing technology to transcribe digital data into a machine-readable optical format, assessing both the advantages and limitations inherent in this approach. Our empirical findings reveal a marked increase in the efficiency of machine-readable optical encoding over conventional digital storage methods, particularly as the volume of data diminishes and the expected lifespan of storage extends indefinitely. This paper aims to illuminate key aspects of long-term digital data storage within business contexts, focusing on aspects such as cost, dependability, legibility, and confidentiality of optically encoded digital information.</description>
