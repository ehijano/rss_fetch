      <title>Resonant amplification of multi-messenger emission in rotating stellar core collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations extending up to $\sim 2\,\mathrm{s}$, we identify a regime of pre-collapse central rotation rates ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Hz}$) that greatly enhances the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) during extended periods of time after bounce. The enhancement is a consequence of the resonance between the frequency of the fundamental quadrupolar $^2f$-mode of oscillation of the proto-neutron star and the frequency of the epicyclic oscillations at the boundary of the inner core. We observe periods of about several hundred milliseconds each where the resonance is active. The GW emission enhancement produces a correlated resonant modulation of the associated neutrino signal at the same frequencies. With GW frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{kHz})$ and strain amplitudes within the sensitivity curves of current and next-generation interferometers at distances of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{Mpc})$, this resonant-amplification mechanism may represent a potential game-changer for unveiling the supernova explosion mechanism through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray emission from memory-burdened primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the memory-burden effect suggest that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with masses smaller than $10^{15}$ grams may be viable dark matter candidates and, consequently, be potential sources of high-energy particles in the present Universe. In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of memory-burdened PBHs into high-energy gamma-rays. Differently from previous analyses, we account for the attenuation of gamma-rays caused by their interaction with background radiation at energies above $10^5~{\rm GeV}$, as well as the secondary emission from the electromagnetic cascades generated during the propagation through extragalactic space. Performing a likelihood analysis with current gamma-ray data, we place new constraints on the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs. Our results show that ultra-high-energy diffuse gamma-ray observations set more restrictive bounds than high-energy neutrino data, particularly in scenarios with a strong memory-burden suppression of the PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Optical and Near-infrared Observations of SN 2023ixf for over 600 days after the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context.We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf, with our extensive observations spanning the phases from ~3 to over 600 days after the first light.\\ Aims.The aim of this study is to obtain key information on the explosion properties of SN\,2023ixf and the nature of its progenitor.\\ Methods.The observational properties of SN\,2023ixf are compared with those of a sample of Type IIP/L SNe to investigate commonalities and diversities. We conduct a detailed analysis of temporal evolution of major spectral features observed throughout different phases of the SN\,2023ixf explosion. Several interpretations are addressed through a comparison between the data and the model spectra for progenitor stars within a range of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.\\ Results.Our observations indicate that SN\,2023ixf is a transitional SN that bridges the gap between Type IIP and IIL subclasses of H-rich SNe, characterized by a relatively short plateau ($\lesssim 70$\,d) in the light curve. It shows a rather prompt spectroscopic evolution toward the nebular phase; emission lines of Na, O, H, and Ca in nebular spectra all exhibit multipeak profiles, which might be attributed to bipolar distribution of the ejecta. In particular, the H$\alpha$ profile can be separated into two central peaked components (with a velocity of about 1500\,km\,s$^{-1}$) that is likely due to nickel-powered ejecta and two outer peak/box components (with a velocity extending up to ~8000 km\,s$^{-1}$) that can arise from interaction of the outermost ejecta with a circumstellar shell at a distance of $\sim6.2\times10^{15}$cm. The nebular-phase spectra of SN\,2023ixf show good agreement with those predicted by model spectra for progenitor stars with a ZAMS mass ranging from 15 to 19\,M${_\odot}$. A distance $D = 6.35^{+0.31}_{-0.39}$\,Mpc is estimated for M101.</description>

      <title>Galactic-scale Feeding Reveals Warped Hypermagnetized Multiphase Circumbinary Accretion Around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in gaseous and stellar environments are prime targets for next-generation space-based gravitational wave detectors. Yet, realistic accretion conditions under which these binary systems evolve are not fully understood. In this work, we demonstrate the hypermagnetized multi-phase nature of the surrounding accretion flow formed by large-scale feeding from a galaxy background. Our simulations indicate that the hypermagnetized circumbinary disk is eccentric and warped, hosting a hot gas core for a parsec-scale separated binary. We also observe collimated bipolar magnetic tower-like outflows launched from each SMBH.</description>

      <title>The impact of binary neutron star outflow mass models on kilonova parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ejecta from binary neutron star mergers, which powers its associated kilonova, can inform us about source properties, merger dynamics, and the dense nuclear matter equation of state. While now in the era of multi-messenger astronomy, we remain more likely to observe purely electromagnetic (or purely gravitational-wave) signals due to the duty cycle and maximum observing distance of gravitational wave detectors. It is thus imperative to be able to perform high-accuracy parameter inference of purely electromagnetic detections. Here, we use a collection of ejecta formulae in an end-to-end analysis to generate mock multi-wavelength kilonova signals and recover the intrinsic merger parameters. By generating mock light curves for a broad range of possible mergers and with a variety of ejecta models, and then performing parameter estimation with different ejecta models, we measure how reliably and consistently we can use the 'map' between intrinsic and outflow properties provided by the formulae to gain source (intrinsic) information from purely electromagnetic detections (observables). We find that the posteriors probability densities are prone to biases when we vary the choice of reference model for our sampler, especially away from the best studied region of the binary parameter space, i.e. near equal mass, low mass binaries. This highlights both the need for improved models for the mass of the ejecta, and the need to exert caution when performing parameter estimation with a single mass model. We also find that most models predict that parameter degeneracies in kilonova light curves are largely orthogonal to those measurement observables, such as the chirp mass, from gravitational wave signals, indicating that kilonovae may provide a lot of additional information even in multi-messenger observations, if better modeled.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration by turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection and the production of gamma-rays and neutrinos in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) resistive simulations have highlighted the significance of ubiquitous turbulence to drive fast reconnection. It has been demonstrated that particle acceleration via reconnection in 3D magnetized flows, where turbulence is embedded in large-scale magnetic fields such as in relativistic jets and accretion flows around compact sources, is remarkably efficient. Particles experience Fermi acceleration across all scales of turbulent reconnection layers, outweighing the considerably slower drift acceleration mechanism. This stands in contrast to recent assertions stemming from PIC simulations, that claimed the dominance of the latter process. In this talk, I review how particle acceleration is driven by 3D turbulent reconnection to very high energies and demonstrate its potential in magnetized regions of AGN jets and accretion disks to explain the gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. Applications to sources such as TXS 0506+056, MRK 501, and NGC 1068 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Observations of supermassive black hole binary candidates. Strong sinusoidal variations at 95, 147 and 225 GHz in PKS 2131$-$021 and PKS J0805$-$0111</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large sinusoidal variations in the radio light curves of the blazars PKS J0805$-$0111 and PKS 2131$-$021 have recently been discovered with an 18-year monitoring programme by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, making these systems strong supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates. The sinusoidal variations in PKS 2131$-$021 dominate its light curves from 2.7 GHz to optical frequencies. We report sinusoidal variations observed in both objects with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 95, 147 and 225 GHz consistent with the radio light curves. The ACT 95 GHz light curve of PKS 2131$-$021 agrees well with the contemporaneous 91.5 GHz ALMA light curve and is comparable in quality. Broadband, intermittent, sinusoidal variations are also observed in PKS J0805$-$0111, for which there are no ALMA or other millimetre light curves, showing that PKS 2131$-$021 is not an isolated case and that these three properties could be common in blazar SMBHB phenomenology. In both blazars the sinusoid phase as a function of frequency as well as the achromaticity of the sinusoid amplitudes are consistent with the expected signature of jets in SMBHB systems. Monitoring of ~8000 blazars by the Simons Observatory over the next decade should provide a large number of SMBHB candidates that will shed light on the nature of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear superburst of MAXI J1752$-$457 observed with NinjaSat and MAXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An uncatalogued bright X-ray transient was detected with MAXI on November 9, 2024, named MAXI J1752$-$457. The NinjaSat X-ray observatory promptly observed the source from November 10 to 18 under the severe Sun angle constraint, which hampered other X-ray observatories from performing follow-up monitoring. The MAXI and NinjaSat light curves in the 2-10 keV band showed fast and slow decaying components at the early and late phases, approximated by exponential functions with e-folding constants of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2 and 14.9 $\pm$ 0.9 hours (1$\sigma$ errors), respectively. A single blackbody model reproduces the X-ray spectrum with a softening trend of its temperature decreasing from 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1 keV to 0.59 $\pm$ 0.06 keV. Assuming the unknown source distance at 8 kpc, at which the initial X-ray luminosity roughly corresponds to the Eddington limit, the shrinking blackbody radius was estimated at 5-11 km. This X-ray brightening is interpreted as a superburst in a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary, which is powered by thermonuclear burning triggered presumably by carbon ignition at a thick layer in the neutron-star outer/deep crust. The transition between two decaying components occurred at 5.5-7.7 hours, corresponding to the thermal time scale of the burning layer. The ignition column density is estimated to be $\sim$(2.8-5.1)$\times 10^{12}$ g cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Supernovae at Distances &lt; 40 Mpc: I.Catalogues and fractions of Supernovae in a Complete Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context.This is the first paper of a series aiming to determine the fractions and birth rates of various types of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to construct a complete sample of SNe in the nearby universe and provide more precise measurement of subtype fractions. Methods.We carefully selected our SN sample at a distance of &lt; 40 Mpc mainly from wide-field surveys conducted over the years from 2016 to 2023. Results.The sample contains a total of 211 SNe, including 109 SNe II, 69 SNe Ia, and 33 SNe Ibc. With the aid of sufficient spectra, we can obtain relatively accurate subtype classifications for all SNe in this sample. After corrections for the Malmquist bias, this volume-limited sample gives fractions of SNe Ia, SNe Ibc, and SNe II as $30.4^{+3.7}_{-11.5}\%$, $16.3^{+3.7}_{-7.4}\%$, and $53.3^{+9.5}_{-18.7}\%$, respectively.In the SN Ia sample, the fraction of the 91T-like subtype becomes relatively low (~5.4\%), while that of the 02cx-like subtype shows a moderate increase (~6.8\%). In the SN Ibc sample, we find significant fractions of broadlined SNe Ic (~18.0\%) and SNe Ibn (~8.8\%). The fraction of 87A-like subtype is determined as ~2.3\% for the first time, indicating rare explosions from blue supergiant stars. We find that SNe Ia show a double peak number distribution in S0- and Sc-type host galaxies, which may serve as a straightforward evidence for the presence of "prompt" and "delayed" progenitor components giving rise to SN Ia explosions. Several subtypes of SNe such as 02cx-like SNe Ia, broadlined SNe Ic, SNe IIn (and perhaps SNe Ibn) are found to occur preferentially in less massive spiral galaxies, favoring their associations with young stellar progenitors. Moreover, the 02cx-like subtype shows a trend of exploding in the outer skirt of their hosts, suggestive of metal-poor progenitors.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hard X-ray Properties of $\gamma$-ray Emitting Narrow Line Seyfert-I Galaxies through NuSTAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch of the Fermi-LAT observatory in 2008, more new gamma-ray objects were discovered, mostly dominated by blazars. In addition, some of the narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies were observed in gamma-ray but in less number, making them different from other NLSy1 galaxies. We studied the six gamma-ray-detected NLSy1 galaxies using the hard X-ray observations from NuSTAR and optical g- &amp; r-band from ZTF. The X-ray spectra corresponding to all objects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong "brighter-when-redder" trend is seen, which is the properties mostly seen in Blazars. The X-ray light curves were produced for all the available observations, and the F$_{var}$ is estimated for all the observations. In 1H 0323+342, we found that F$_{var}$ lies between 9-22%, suggesting significant variability in the same source. Similarly, for PKS 2004-447, we found F$_{var}$ lies between 10-21%. We see a strong X-ray and gamma-ray spectral index correlation among these objects, suggesting that X-rays and gamma-rays are produced through a similar process. Comparing the X-ray spectral index with other class objects, we see that NLSy1 galaxies are similar to LBL and IBL types. We see a negative trend of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray luminosity in these objects, suggesting an anti-correlation between X-ray and gamma-ray luminosity. A similar trend is seen between the X-ray flux, total jet power, and disk luminosity. The X-ray spectral index also shows a negative trend with total jet power and disk luminosity. The optical variability amplitude lies between 0.90 to 2.32, and the fractional variability varies from 13-40%. The color-magnitude plot shows mostly the brighter-when-redder trend, suggesting $\gamma$-NLSy1 are much closer to FSRQs than BL Lacs. Our results, overall, summarize how the various parameters in gamma-ray-detected NLSy1 are connected.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the intensity-dependent wake structure of Vela X-1 using MAXI/GSC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Vela X-1 is among the earliest discovered high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) pulsars. In such systems, the companion's stellar wind is strongly affected by ionisation from X-rays emitted by the compact object. A smooth, isotropic stellar wind model cannot account for the observed orbital variation in absorption column density. A stream-like photoionisation wake trailing the neutron star has been proposed to explain this variation. Aims. We investigated the variability of the circumbinary environment at different intensity levels of the Vela X-1 and used a model similar to the above-mentioned stream-like photoionisation wake to explain the asymmetric absorption column density present in the source. Methods. The 2.0-20.0 keV MAXI/GSC spectrum was well modelled with a Comptonised continuum absorbed by local and interstellar material. Nearly 13 years of MAXI/GSC data was used to constrain the variations in absorption column density in Vela X-1 from orbital-phase and intensity-and-orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy. Results. The long-term light curve of Vela X-1 shows orbit-to-orbit intensity level variations without any apparent super-orbital periodicity. The orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy in multiple intensity levels reveals asymmetric variation in absorption column density changes across the intensity levels. Conclusions. We confirm that the orbital variation in absorption column density in Vela X-1 cannot be explained by a smooth stellar wind alone using long-term MAXI/GSC data. An additional component, such as a photoionisation or accretion wake, is required. The wake structure is present across intensity levels, with geometry varying by intensity. The long-term MAXI/GSC data enabled us to vary wake parameters and derive best-fit stellar wind parameters for the time-averaged intensity, reproducing observed absorption column density across intensity levels.

Abstract: Context.This is the second paper of a series aiming to determine the birth rates of supernovae in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to estimate the SN rates in the local universe and fit the delay-time distribution of SNe Ia to put constraints on their progenitor scenarios. Methods.We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the volumetric rates with the nearby SN sample introduced in Paper I of the series. The rate evolution of core-collapse SNe well traces the evolution of cosmic star formation history; while that of SNe Ia involves the convolution of cosmic star-formation history and a two-component delay-time distribution including a power law and a Gaussian component. Results.The volumetric rates of type Ia, Ibc and II SNe are derived as $0.325\pm0.040^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$, $0.160\pm0.028^{+0.044}_{-0.014}$, and $0.528\pm0.051^{+0.162}_{-0.013}$ (in unit of $10^{-4} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} h^3_{70}$), respectively. The rate of CCSNe is consistent with previous estimates. The newly derived local SN Ia rate is larger than existing results given at redshifts 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1, favoring an increased rate from the universe at z ~ 0.1 to the local universe. A two-component model can well fit the rate variation, with the power law component accounting for the rate evolution at larger redshifts and the Gaussian component with a delay time of 12.63$\pm$0.38 Gyr accounting for the local rate evolution. This delayed component with such a longer delay time suggests that the progenitors of these SNe Ia were formed at around 1 Gyr after the birth of the universe, which could only be explained by a double-degenerate progenitor scenario. This is evidenced by the comparison with the PTF sample of SNe Ia at z = 0.073, which reveals that the increase in SN Ia rate at z &lt; 0.01 is primarily due to the SNe Ia of massive E and S0 galaxies with old stellar populations.</description>

      <title>SNR G54.1+0.3, a PeVatron candidate unveiled by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration reported the first very-high-energy gamma-ray catalog, containing 90 TeV sources. Among these sources, 1LHAASO J1929+1846u is located 0.3$^\circ$ west of SNR G54.1+0.3 and also lies within a $+53 \, \text{km s}^{-1}$ cloud (the Western Cloud). Moreover, one of the IceCube track-type high-energy starting events is found around 1.3$^\circ$ north of 1LHAASO J1929+1846u, which may serve as strong evidence for the hadronic origin of this TeV source. SNR G54.1+0.3 is a young supernova remnant (SNR), with a powerful pulsar wind nebula (PWN) inside. Its X-ray radiation from the PWN and the SNR Shell can be clearly identified. The radio emission from the PWN region is also given. However, given the angular resolution of gamma-ray experiments, the entire SNR region is viewed as a point source by Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and VERITAS. In this work, we explore a hybrid scenario where SNR G54.1+0.3 is indeed associated with the Western Cloud, and we derive the multi-wavelength emissions from the PWN, the SNR Shell, and the Western Cloud, separately. Our model can explain the observations well, indicating that SNR G54.1+0.3 might be an excellent candidate of Galactic PeVatron and neutrino source.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Polarimetric Study of Weakly Magnetized Neutron Star X-ray binary GX 349+2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first spectro-polarimetric investigation of the bright Z-type source GX 349+2 using simultaneous observations of \textit{IXPE}, \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{Swift/XRT}. The source exhibited significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range during the flaring branch (FB) and normal branch (NB). The estimated polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) for FB are $1.74 \pm 0.52\%$ ($3.3\sigma$) and $19.4 \pm 8.9^\circ$, respectively; while for NB, PD and PA are $0.8 \pm 0.22\%$ ($3.6\sigma$) and $35.4 \pm 7.9^\circ$, respectively. The energy-resolved polarization for NB revealed an increase in PD from $0.78\pm0.2\%$ ($3.6\sigma$) to $1.32\pm0.40\%$ ($3.3\sigma$) and a change in PA from $17.9\pm8.1^\circ$, and $53.2\pm8.6^\circ$, in the energy range of 2-4 and 4-8 keV, respectively. Using the simultaneous observations of \textit{Swift/XRT} and \textit{NuSTAR}, we investigated the spectral properties of the source during NB, and the Western model well explained it. The spectra also depicted a strong and broad Fe K$\alpha$ line. However, spectro-polarimetric analyses carried out by \textit{IXPE} align closely with model-independent polarimetric results. We discuss results obtained from the polarimetric studies in the context of various coronal geometries, and we confirm the slab-like geometry in the NB for GX 349+2.</description>

      <title>A Phase-resolved View of Millihertz Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the Ultraluminous X-ray Source M51 ULX-7: Evidence for a Magnetically Truncated Disk and Geometrical Beaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) and extragalactic ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this study, we perform a phase-resolved analysis of recently discovered X-ray millihertz QPOs in M51 ULX-7. This represents the first detailed phase-resolved analysis of QPOs conducted in ULXs. Our findings reveal that the amplitude of the mHz QPO slightly increases with photon energy, accompanied by a narrowing of the phase modulation profile. The phase-resolved spectroscopy indicates significant variability in the energy spectrum: both disk blackbody components exhibit marked variations on the QPO timescale, with the low-temperature component demonstrating significant synchronous changes in the disk temperature and luminosity, showing a positive correlation between these two parameters throughout the QPO cycle. This correlation supports the hypothesis that the disk inner radius corresponds to the magnetospheric radius, which slightly varies with the accretion rate. Our results suggest that the soft component, without beaming, originates from a magnetically truncated outer disk, while the hard component is geometrically beamed from the inner funnel regions.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Observations of fast radio variations in microquasars by FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars are the compact objects generally including accreting black holes which produce relativistic jets. The physical mechanisms of jet launching, collimation, and acceleration are poorly understood. Microquasars show strong variability in multi-wavelength observations. In X-rays, the sources show the fast variation features down to millisecond time scales, with the prominent quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around 0.1 Hz - tens of Hz in light curves, however, physical origin of QPOs is still uncertain. FAST as the largest radio telescope provides the opportunity to study fast variability of both radio flux and polarization in microquasars. In the FAST observations from 2020 - 2022, we reported the first evidence of radio subsecond quasi-periodic oscillations of GRS 1915+105, providing the direct link between QPOs and the dynamics of relativistic jets. These QPOs with the centroid frequency around 5 Hz are transient, accompanied with strong evolution of the spectral index. Combined with multiwavelength observations, we discuss the possible physical models to produce radio QPOs in BH systems: the helical motion of jet knots or precession of the jet base. In near future, high time resolution radio monitoring of microquasars based on FAST is expected to discover more new phenomena in black hole systems, which will be important to understand the physics in strong gravity.</description>

      <title>The First Search for Optical Transient as a Counterpart of a Month-timescale IceCube Neutrino Multiplet Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical transients with timescale of months, such as supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), are candidates of high-energy neutrino sources. Multiple neutrino detections from the same direction within a month timescale provide a unique opportunity to identify such optical counterparts in the nearby Universe. In this work, we conduct archival search for the optical counterpart of an IceCube triplet event using the data of Zwicky Transient Facility. We develop a dedicated alert filtering system and validate the performance by following a blind analysis method. Applying this filtering system to the data after the detections of the IceCube triplet event, we find no transient candidates within the localization area. Assuming that the IceCube triplet event originates from an astrophysical source, we constrain parameters of optical transient, a peak luminosity and a decay timescale, using a simple signal model that is motivated by TDEs and superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Assuming the case with no time lag between neutrino detections and optical peak, almost entire parameter space of the known TDEs and SLSNe would be constrained. To give constraints on transients with a rapidly evolving light curve, quick follow-up observations for future neutrino multiplet events are crucial.</description>

      <title>The spin measurement of the black hole SLX 1746-331 using Insight-HXMT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-ray spectral analysis of a black hole X-ray binary SLX 1746-331 during the 2023 outburst using five \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations. We jointly use the reflection model \texttt{relxillcp} and the general relativistic thermal thin disk model \texttt{kerrbb} to fit the spectra from 2 - 100 keV. By jointly fitting the five spectra, we constrained the black hole mass to be $M=5.8\pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{*}=0.88^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ (90 percent statistical confidence). The reflection model shows that SLX 1746-331 is a high-inclination system with the inclination angle $i=63.7^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ degrees, the accretion disk has a density $\rm{log}N\sim 16 ~\rm cm^{-3}$. In addition, with the different reflection model \texttt{relxilllp}, which assumes a lamp-post geometry corona, we still give similar results.</description>

      <title>Broad-band noises in GX 339-4 during the 2021 outburst observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid X-ray variability of GX 339$-$4 including the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) and broad-band noises have been observed with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit {NICER}) during the 2021 outburst. Here we present a systematic study of the evolution and energy dependence properties of such broad-band noises (BBN). The outburst from February to March of 2021 can be divided into three stages: the low hard state (LHS), the hard intermediate state (HIMS) and soft intermediate state (SIMS). In the PDSs of the LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian components: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$ and a high-frequency component $L_3$. The increasing trend of the characteristic frequencies for $L_1$ and $L_2$ and the relation between the QPO frequency and characteristic BBN frequency are reported. We found that the energies corresponding to the peaks and shapes of the rms spectra for three BBN components are different. The comparison among three BBN components indicates that energy-dominant bands of these BBN components are distinct. Our results can be explained with the truncated disc/hot flow model with a large variable disc and a small hot inner flow. A possible description of the accretion structure and its evolution from the LHS to the SIMS is proposed. Further research is still required to probe such accretion structure in GX 339--4.</description>

      <title>Low-Count X-ray Polarimetry using the Bayesian Approach Reveals Fast Polarization Angle Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry of accreting compact object has revealed fast time variations in the polarization angle (PA), suggesting that the geometry and/or optical depth of the corona is changing rapidly. This prompts investigations into how fast such variability can be. Conventionally, the data are often binned to examine the time variability such that the measurement in each bin is above the minimum detectable polarization (MDP). Here we demonstrate that this is unnecessary, and even below the MDP, one can infer the posterior distribution of PA reliably using the Bayesian approach and still be able to place useful constraints on the physics in many cases. With this approach, we discovered that the PA variation in one of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of GX 13+1 is not following a linear rotation mode as suggested previously. Instead, the PA swings between two discrete angles, suggesting that there are two emitting components, e.g., the boundary layer and the spreading layer, competing with each other. Also in one of the observations of GX 13+1 and Sco X-1, the PA is found to vary in correlation with the source count rate, indicating that the mass accretion rate is shaping the corona properties. Also, during the IXPE observation of Sco X-1, the PA in highest flux level seems to deviate from the averaged value and appear to be consistent with previous measurement results with PolarLight and OSO-8.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star merger offsets from their host galaxies II. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) binaries have long been linked to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). However, despite their stellar progenitors, SGRBs are often found outside the stellar light of the host galaxy. This is commonly attributed to supernova kicks, which displace the SGRB progenitors from the original stellar population. Our goal is to use stellar population synthesis models to reproduce and interpret the observed offsets of a statistical sample of SGRBs, using realistic galactic models based on the observed host properties. We derive the host galaxy potentials from the observed properties on a case-by-case basis, and simulate the galactic trajectories of synthetic BNSs and NSBHs from the BPASS code using three different kick prescriptions. We compare predicted and observed offsets to investigate the impact of velocity kicks, host galaxy types, and host association criteria. The results confirm that the locations of the SGRB population are consistent with the expectations of kicked BNS or BHNS progenitors, implying that such mergers are the dominant (if not only) progenitor system. Predictions for NSBHs provide a significantly worse fit compared to BNSs, while we find no significant difference when comparing different kick prescriptions. For late-type hosts, we find the best agreement when including hosts with a probability of chance alignment Pch up to 20%, while lower Pch thresholds lead us to overestimate SGRB offsets. We argue that Pch is biased against viable hosts at the largest offsets, and suggest the use of less conservative Pch thresholds for late-type hosts. For early-type hosts, the predictions underestimate SGRB offsets in a few cases regardless of the Pch threshold applied. We argue that this is likely due to the models missing galaxy evolution, or spurious host associations.</description>

      <title>The GRINTA hard X-ray mission: an Explorer of the Transient Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of time domain multi-messenger (MM) astrophysics requires sensitive, large field-of-view (FoV) observatories that are able to quickly react in order to respond to alerts from gravitational wave (GW) triggers, neutrino detections, and transient sources from all parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. This is particularly true at hard X-rays and soft gamma-rays where the EM counterparts to GW triggers, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), emit most of their flux. While the present decade has a number of instruments capable of accomplishing this task, there are no missions planned for the 2030's when improved MM facilities will detect many more events. It is in this context that we present the GRINTA mission concept. GRINTA has a large area, large FoV detector to search for short, impulsive events in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range and a coded mask telescope for localizing and performing follow-up observations of sources from 5-200 keV. While GRINTA's main scientific goal is studying MM events, the instruments will observe numerous other sources to explore the sky at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Modeling the circumstellar interaction around SN 2004gq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the mass-loss history and final evolutionary stage of massive stars and the properties of the observable supernova (SN) is still under debate. This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe, where the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its evolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the exploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may contribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the interaction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be investigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within around $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely unexplored for these objects.
  Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC) analysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the unusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction scenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this with a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs (taken at 1.4,\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average mass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to CSM models.
  We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and magnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy source related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this medium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find that the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that provides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a simple semi-analytic model.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic sub-structure of RRAT J1913+1330</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest a universal relationship between the quasi-periodic sub-structures and rotational periods across various types of radio-emitting neutron stars. In this study, we report the detection of 12 quasi-periodic sub-structures in a rotating radio transient (RRAT) J1913+1330 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). This is the second known RRAT exhibiting quasi-periodic sub-structures. Our result reinforces the observed relationship between quasi-periodicity and rotational period. The polarization analysis reveals that 11 of the 12 pulses exhibit high linear polarization consistent with the quasi-periodic behaviour of the total intensity, while circular polarization with detectable quasi-periodic sub-structures is observed in only three pulses. No correlation is found between the sub-structure periods and their widths, peak fluxes, or fluences, even under the extremely variable single-pulse energy and morphology observed in J1913+1330.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of extremely bright GRB 230307A: Evidence of evolution from photospheric to synchrotron dominated emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation mechanisms powering Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their physical processes remain one of the unresolved questions in high-energy astrophysics. Spectro-polarimetric observations of exceptionally bright GRBs provide a powerful diagnostic tool to address these challenges. GRB 230307A, the second-brightest long-duration GRB ever detected, exhibits a rare association with a Kilonova, offering a unique and rare probe into the emission processes of GRBs originating from compact object mergers. We present a comprehensive time-averaged and time-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis of GRB 230307A using joint observations from the $AstroSat$ Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI), the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and $Konus$-Wind. Spectral analysis reveals a temporal evolution in the low-energy photon index, $\alpha$, transitioning from a hard to a softer state over the burst duration. Time-averaged polarimetric measurements yield a low polarization fraction ($&lt;$ 12.7 %), whereas time-resolved polarization analysis unveils a marked increase in polarization fractions ($&gt;$ 49 %) in the later stages of the emission episode. This spectro-polarimetric evolution suggests a transition in the dominant radiative mechanism: the initial phase characterized by thermal-dominated photospheric emission (unpolarized or weakly polarized) gives way to a regime dominated by non-thermal synchrotron emission (highly polarized). This transition provides critical evidence for the evolving influence of magnetic fields in shaping the GRB emission process and jet dynamics.</description>

      <title>X-ray variability of VHE detected FSRQs: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) are weak sources of very high energy (VHE; E&gt;100 GeV) emission, despite exhibiting strong MeV-GeV emissions that dominate their radiative output. To date, only ten FSRQs have been detected at VHEs, primarily during bright optical phases. In this study, we perform a detailed and systematic, temporal, and spectral analysis of the nine VHE-detected FSRQs, using the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) data. Our findings show no correlation between VHE activity and the X-ray flux or spectral state of the sources. However, investigation of spectral properties with X-ray brightness shows anti-correlation between flux and spectral index. The X-ray, generally with a different spectral shape lies at the farther end of the optical-UV synchrotron spectrum which typically shows a declining power-law spectrum, and thus, the X-ray spectrum is generally explained by Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process. However, if optical-UV synchrotron emission extends into the X-ray band, it can soften the X-ray spectrum. While most sources in our sample exhibit rising X-ray SEDs, indicative of non-synchrotron origins or minimal synchrotron contributions, many display softer or flat X-ray spectra, mainly during low X-ray flux states (e.g., 4C +21.35, 3C 279, TON 0599, PKS 1441+25, and PKS 0346-27) suggesting potential synchrotron contributions. These synchrotron continuations influence the gamma-ray spectrum, implying extension into the VHE range for inverse Compton (IC) scattering in the Thomson scattering limit. If the extended component corresponds to an underlying low-level emission, these FSRQs could represent potential candidates for persistent VHE activity.</description>

      <title>Distortions in Periodicity Analysis of Blazars: The Impact of Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, a unique class of active galactic nuclei, exhibit highly variable emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. This variability frequently manifests as intense flaring events, sparking an ongoing debate in recent literature about whether these flares exhibit periodic behavior in certain sources. However, many blazars also show clear signs of stochastic, uncorrelated flares that do not follow a regular pattern. This paper explores how the presence of one such of these stochastic flares can distort an intrinsically periodic pattern of emission in blazars. Our results demonstrate that, depending on the specific circumstances, the deviations in significance and periods can exceed 100\%. Sometimes, these deviations can be so severe that they eliminate any evidence of a periodic pattern. These findings highlight the dramatic impact that flares can have on periodicity searches. To confront this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, the Singular Spectrum Analysis method, which appears more robust against the effects of flares. As an alternative solution, we also propose the sigma clipping technique to mitigate the impact of flares. This framework offers a valuable foundation for analyzing periodicity in similar astrophysical sources that are also subject to stochastic flaring events.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB Outriggers: Design Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has emerged as the world's premier facility for studying fast radio bursts (FRBs) through its fast transient search backend CHIME/FRB\@. The CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will augment this high detection rate of 2--3 FRBs per day with the ability to precisely localize them using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Using three strategically located stations in North America and deploying recently developed synoptic VLBI observing techniques, the Outriggers will provide $\sim 50$~milliarcsecond localization precision for the majority of detected FRBs. This paper presents an overview of the design and implementation of the Outriggers, covering their geographic distribution, structural design, and observational capabilities. We detail the scientific objectives driving the project, including the characterization of FRB populations, host galaxy demographics, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. We also discuss the calibration strategies available to mitigate ionospheric and instrumental effects, ensuring high-precision localization. With two stations currently in science operations, and the third in commissioning, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project is poised to become a cornerstone of the FRB field, offering unprecedented insights into this enigmatic cosmic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>An X-ray and Optical Study of the Dwarf Nova Candidate OGLE-BLG-DN-0064</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source OGLE-BLG-DN-0064 (hereafter OGLE64) was classified as a potential dwarf nova based on its regular outburst activity revealed by the OGLE optical survey. In this paper, we investigate the X-ray and optical emissions from the source OGLE64 based on archival Chandra and Swift X-ray data and our optical observations with the 6-m BTA telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. OGLE64 shows an X-ray luminosity $ L_X \approx 1.6 \times 10^{32} \, \text{erg s}^{-1} $ and a high X-ray-to-optical flux ratio $ F_X / F_{\text{opt}} \approx 1.5$, typical for accreting white dwarfs. The X-ray spectrum of OGLE64 is better fitted by the models of a power law with a photon index $\Gamma \approx 1.9$ and an optically thin plasma with a temperature $ kT \approx 6.4 \, \text{keV} $. The optical spectrum shows hydrogen and neutral helium emission lines, in some of which a double-peaked structure is observed. An analysis of the outburst activity of OGLE64, based on data from the OGLE, ZTF, ATLAS, and ASAS-SN optical surveys, has revealed superoutbursts with a characteristic supercycle $ P_{\text{super}} \approx 400 \, \text{days} $. We found no significant variability in either the X-ray or optical light curves of OGLE64 that could be associated with the change in the visibility conditions for the emitting regions at different orbital phases. Our estimates of the orbital period of the system by indirect methods show that the period probably lies in the range $ P_{\text{orb}} \sim 1.5 - 3.5 \, \text{h} $. The properties of the X-ray and optical emissions from OGLE64 lead us to conclude that the system is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova.</description>

      <title>Retrieving the hot CGM physics from the X-ray radial profile from eROSITA with an IlustrisTNG-based forward model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent eROSITA measurements of the radial profiles of the hot CGM in the Milky-Way stellar mass (MW-mass) regime provide us with a new benchmark to constrain the hot gas around MW-mass central and satellite galaxies and their halo mass distributions. Modelling this rich data set with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations is required to further our understanding of the shortcomings in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution models. We develop forward models for the stacked X-ray radial surface brightness profile measured by eROSITA around MW-mass galaxies. Our model contains two emitting components: hot gas (around central galaxies and satellite galaxies hosted by more massive halos) and X-ray point sources (X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei). We model the hot gas profile using the TNG300-based products. We generate mock observations with our TNG300-based model (matching stellar mass and redshift with observations) with different underlying halo mass distributions. We show that for the same mean stellar mass, a factor 2x increase in the mean value of the underlying halo mass distribution results in a ~4x increase in the stacked X-ray luminosity from the hot CGM. The point sources are described by a simple point-spread-function (PSF) of eROSITA, and we fit their normalization in this work. Using empirical models to derive a permissible range of AGN and XRB luminosities in the MW-mass X-ray galaxy stack, we choose our forward model best describing the hot CGM for the eROSITA observations. We find that at &lt; 40 kpc from the galaxy centre, the hot CGM from central galaxies and the X-ray point sources emission each account for 40-50% of the total X-ray emission budget. In summary, we show that the gas physics driving the shape of the observed hot CGM (in stellar-mass-selected samples) is tightly correlated by the underlying halo-mass distribution (abridged).</description>

      <title>Probing the Firn Refractive Index Profile and Borehole Closure Using Antenna Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for extracting firn ice properties using S-parameter reflection coefficients (`$S_{11}$') of antennas lowered into boreholes. Coupled with Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations and calculations, a depth-dependent $S_{11}$ profile can be translated into a refractive index profile. Since the response of an antenna deployed into a dry borehole depends on the diameter of the hole, multi-year $S_{11}$ measurements also permit an estimate of borehole closure complementary to estimates based on calipers or other dedicated mechanical loggers. We present first results, based on data taken in August, 2024 from boreholes at Summit Station, Greenland. We estimate borehole closure resolution of $\mathbf{\sim 2}$mm and also derive an index of refraction profile consistent with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Axion Superradiance in Dipole Magnetic Fields of Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the axion-photon coupling by superradiance due to a plasma instability in the magnetospheres of millisecond pulsars. We compute the growth rate of a superradiant axion cloud in a dipole magnetic field, and give a semi-analytical formula for the superradiance rate for the lowest state. By requiring the associated instability time to be longer than the characteristic age of the supermassive black-widow millisecond pulsar PSR J0952-0607, we examine the pulsar-timing array constraints on axions of mass $\sim 10^{-12}\text{ eV}$. We find that competitive axion bounds from plasma instabilities are unlikely unless a new high spin pulsar is discovered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic turbulence is an effective mechanism for particle acceleration in strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In this study, we investigate a scenario where turbulent plasma is influenced by a strong guide magnetic field, resulting in highly anisotropic turbulent fluctuations. In such cases, the magnetic moments of particles are conserved, which means that acceleration can only occur along the direction of the magnetic field. Consistent with previous analytic studies, we find through PIC simulations of magnetically dominated pair plasma that the momenta of accelerated particles are closely aligned with the magnetic field lines. Notably, the alignment angle decreases as particle energy increases, potentially limited only by the inherent curvature and gradients of the turbulent magnetic fluctuations. This finding has significant implications for interpreting the synchrotron radiation emitted by highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This study explores Lorentz gauge theory, an alternative gravitational framework offering promising solutions to longstanding conceptual issues in quantum gravity and cosmology. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

Abstract: Double white dwarf binaries are a leading explanation to the origin of type Ia supernovae, but no system exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass limit (1.4 M$_\odot$) has been found that will explode anywhere close to a Hubble time. Here, we present the super-Chandrasekhar mass double white dwarf WDJ181058.67+311940.94 whose merger time ($22.6\pm1.0$ Gyr) is of the same order as a Hubble time. The mass of the binary is large, combining to $1.555\pm0.044$ M$_\odot$, while being located only 49 pc away. We predict that the binary will explode dynamically via a double detonation destroying both stars just before they merge, appearing as a subluminous type Ia supernova with a peak apparent magnitude of about $m_V=-16$ (200,000 times brighter than Jupiter). The observationally-derived birthrate of super-Chandrasekhar mass double white dwarfs is now at least $6.0\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the observed rate of type Ia supernovae in the Milky Way from such systems is approximately $4.4\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the predicted type Ia supernova rate in the Milky Way from all progenitor channels is about sixty times larger. Hence, WDJ181058.67+311940.94 mitigates the observed deficit of massive double white dwarfs witnessed in volume-complete populations, but further evidence is required to determine the majority progenitors of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Simulating short GRB jets in late binary neutron star merger environments</title>

Abstract: The electromagnetic emission and the afterglow observations of the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817A confirmed the association of the merger with a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) harboring a narrow ($5${\deg}-$10${\deg}) and powerful ($10^{49}$-$10^{50}~$erg) jet. Using the 1~second-long neutrino-radiation-GR-MHD simulation of coalescing neutron stars of Kiuchi et al. (2023) and following the semi-analytical estimates of Pais et al. (2023), we inject a narrow, powerful, unmagnetized jet into the post-merger phase. We explore different opening angles, luminosities, central engine durations, and times after the merger. We explore early ($0.1~$s following the merger) and late ($1~$s) jet launches; the latter is consistent with the time delay of $\approx 1.74~$s observed between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. We demonstrate that the semi-analytical estimates correctly predict the jets' breakout and collimation conditions. When comparing our synthetic afterglow light curves to the observed radio data of GW170807, we find a good agreement for a $3 \times 10^{49}$ ergs jet launched late with an opening angle in the range $\simeq 5${\deg}-$7${\deg}.</description>

      <title>Validation of straight-line signal propagation for radio signal of very inclined cosmic ray air showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural nonuniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. The refraction due to a nonuniform atmosphere is however expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction. This effect is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find a difference of 2% in radiation energy and a difference of O(0.01{\deg}) on direction reconstruction when working at frequencies below 600 MHz. We thus find that, for frequencies up to 600 MHz and zenith angles up to 88{\deg}, the current straight-line based simulation approaches are accurate.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues). We also find that including further sources results in a rapid decrease in the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Modeling the shadow of Sgr A* through an eclipsing black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr\,A* resolved the shadow image and emission ring-like structure, which is associated to the photon ring of the supermassive black hole, at the galactic centre, revealing a diameter of $51.8~\mu \text{as}$. The ring-like structure is consistent with that of a Kerr black hole. However, the source of the high bright regions in the image and the time variability remain an open question. Besides the plasma properties and emission models, the spacetime geometry also holds an important role. We present an image depicting the bright hot spots consistent with Sgr\,A* observations at a wavelength $ \lambda = 1.3\, {\rm mm}$. The image is the result of an eclipsing Schwarzschild black hole situated along the line of sight between the galactic centre and Earth. The separation from both, primary (Sgr\,A*) and secondary (eclipsing) black holes is $10233\, {\rm AU}$. The central supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy has an observational mass of $4.14\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary eclipsing black hole has an inferred mass of $1035\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the hunt for extraterrestrial high-energy neutrino counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a decade since the IceCube collaboration began detecting high-energy (HE) neutrinos originating from cosmic sources. Despite a few well-known individual associations and numerous phenomenological, observational, and statistical multiwavelength studies, the origin of astrophysical HE neutrinos largely remains a mystery. To date, the most convincing associations link HE neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN). Consequently, many studies have attempted population-based correlation tests between HE neutrinos and specific AGN subpopulations (such as blazars). While some of associations are suggestive, no definitive population-based correlation has been established. This could result from either a lack of a population-based correlation or insufficient detection power, given the substantial atmospheric neutrino background. By leveraging blazar variability, we performed spatio-temporal blazar-neutrino correlation tests aimed at enhancing detection power by reliably incorporating temporal information into the statistical analysis. We used simulations to evaluate the detection power of our method under various test strategies. We find that: (1) with sufficiently large source samples, if 20% of astrophysical HE neutrinos originate from blazars, we should robustly observe $\sim$4$\sigma$ associations; (2) a counting-based test-statistic combined with a top-hat weighting scheme (rather than a Gaussian one) provides the greatest detection power; (3) applying neutrino sample cuts reduces detection power when a weighting scheme is used; (4) in top-hat-like weighting schemes, small p-values do not occur arbitrarily with an increase in HE neutrino error region size (any such occurrence is indicative of an underlying blazar-neutrino correlation).</description>

      <title>ASKAP and VLASS search for a radio-continuum counterpart of ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of an Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) 944 MHz and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) 3~GHz search for a radio-continuum counterpart of the recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. Using (ASKAP), we catalog 1052 radio sources within the 1.5$^\circ$ radius search area (68% certainty region) around the particle's calculated origin, 10 of which we classify as blazar candidates based on their radio spectra. The most prominent radio source in the search area is the nearby spiral galaxy UGCA 127 (nicknamed Phaedra, From Greek: $\phi\alpha i\delta\rho\alpha$, a Cretan princess of Greek Mythology, derived from Phaidros, Greek: ${\phi}{\alpha}{\iota}{\delta}{\rho}o{\varsigma}$, meaning 'bright'.). Its non-thermal radio spectrum classifies it as a non-blazar active galactic nucleus (AGN). We also present an extended radio source, WISEA J061715.89-075455.4 (nicknamed Hebe, From Greek: $H{\beta}{\eta}$, the Greek goddess of youth.), located only ~7' from the geometric center of the search area, with a very unusual highly polarized compact component. Finally, we present a strong radio source, EMU J062248-072246 (nicknamed Narcissus, From Greek $N{\alpha}{\rho}{\kappa}{\iota}{\sigma}{\sigma}o{\zeta}$ was a self-absorbed hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia.), which has a maximum self-absorption spectral slope of +2.5 at low frequencies, and exhibits ~25% flux density variability over the ~5-year VLASS 3~GHz survey.</description>

      <title>Variability study of classical supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray variability of the supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1907+09 using the new NuSTAR observation of 2024. The source had a relatively stable flux level during previous NuSTAR observations, but the flux varied significantly during the current one. The light curve exhibits dips (off-state) and flares (on-state). The phase-coherent timing analysis during the on-state yields a pulse period of $443.99(4)~\mathrm{s}$, showing the pulsar's continued spin-down. The pulse profiles show an asymmetric double-peaked structure with a phase separation of 0.47 between the two peaks. A cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) is also detected at $\sim 17.6~\mathrm{keV}$, along with its harmonic at $\sim 38~\mathrm{keV}$, persisting across all flux states. Flux-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the CRSF remains constant despite a 25-fold change in flux. The spectral parameters like photon index and e-fold energy are out of phase with the pulse shape, whereas cutoff energy is in phase with the pulse shape. The source's luminosity during the on-state is $2.85 \times 10^{35}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, consistent with a "pencil" beam radiation pattern expected at this flux level from a collisionless gas-mediated shock. These results offer further insights into the accretion dynamics and magnetic field geometry of this system.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as a Factory of Axions: Extragalactic Photons from Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are significant sources of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), provided their Hawking temperature exceeds the particles' masses. Given the predominant decay of axions into photons, the enhanced photon spectrum they generate can be feasibly detected using sensitive detectors. This paper introduces a novel methodology that elucidates the decay process for particles to traverse and decay over cosmological timescales. Specifically, we derive estimations for the photon spectrum and flux, assuming a monochromatic mass spectrum and isotropic distribution for PBHs. Encouragingly, forthcoming detectors like e-ASTROGAM are well positioned to capture this signal.</description>

      <title>Naturalness in Soft Leptogenesis and Gravitino Mass Bound due to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If sneutrinos are produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, then some interesting features of soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with heavy right-handed neutrinos, are found. The required baryonic asymmetry could be possible from the decays of sneutrinos, for the soft SUSY breaking trilinear $A$ and bilinear $B$ parameters around the electroweak scale. The resonance condition in soft leptogenesis is not required. The allowed regions of different relevant parameters are discussed in detail. Using experimental constraints from collider searches on heavy leptons, the lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass is found to be around $300$ GeV with Yukawa coupling lesser than about $0.4$. The allowed region of the typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also shown from the experimental constraint on the branching ratio for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ in MEG-II search. Depending on PBH mass, bounds on the mass of gravitinos, produced from PBH evaporation, is discussed and gravitino mass around the electroweak scale is found to be possible only for unstable gravitino.</description>

Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the prediction of a boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities $\eta \lesssim 10^{11}\textrm{-}10^{14}$ on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on NS cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors, reflectionless scattering modes, and echoes of ultracompact horizonless objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

      <title>Double progenitor origin of the S-star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>

      <title>Expanded atlas of the sky in continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the full release of the atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering frequencies from 20 Hz to 1700 Hz and spindowns from -5e-10 to 5e-10 Hz/s. Compared to the early atlas release, we have extended the frequency range and have performed follow-up on the outliers. Conducting continuous wave searches is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The atlas facilitates the execution of new searches with relatively minimal computing resources.</description>
