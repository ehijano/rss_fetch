      <title>Accelerating Post-Quantum Cryptography via LLM-Driven Hardware-Software Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.</description>

      <title>Development of an Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Data Movement Strategy for Next-Generation Heterogeneous Mixed-Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.</description>

      <title>ALPHA-PIM: Analysis of Linear Algebraic Processing for High-Performance Graph Applications on a Real Processing-In-Memory System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing large-scale graph datasets is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Processor-centric CPU and GPU architectures, commonly used for graph applications, often face bottlenecks caused by extensive data movement between the processor and memory units due to low data reuse. As a result, these applications are often memory-bound, limiting both performance and energy efficiency due to excessive data transfers. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) offers a promising approach to mitigate data movement bottlenecks by integrating computation directly within or near memory. Although several previous studies have introduced custom PIM proposals for graph processing, they do not leverage real-world PIM systems.
  This work aims to explore the capabilities and characteristics of common graph algorithms on a real-world PIM system to accelerate data-intensive graph workloads. To this end, we (1) implement representative graph algorithms on UPMEM's general-purpose PIM architecture; (2) characterize their performance and identify key bottlenecks; (3) compare results against CPU and GPU baselines; and (4) derive insights to guide future PIM hardware design.
  Our study underscores the importance of selecting optimal data partitioning strategies across PIM cores to maximize performance. Additionally, we identify critical hardware limitations in current PIM architectures and emphasize the need for future enhancements across computation, memory, and communication subsystems. Key opportunities for improvement include increasing instruction-level parallelism, developing improved DMA engines with non-blocking capabilities, and enabling direct interconnection networks among PIM cores to reduce data transfer overheads.</description>

      <title>karl. - A Research Vehicle for Automated and Connected Driving</title>

Abstract: As highly automated driving is transitioning from single-vehicle closed-access testing to commercial deployments of public ride-hailing in selected areas (e.g., Waymo), automated driving and connected cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) remain active fields of research. Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving.

      <title>Hazel: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern supercomputers and data center clusters, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce Hazel, a storage management system that extends the NVMe-oF protocol capabilities and adheres to the CC threat model, providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. Hazel offers an appropriate control path with novel concepts such as counter-leasing. Hazel also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata and introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), all while remaining compatible with NVMe-oF. For additional efficiency, Hazel also supports offloading to CC-capable smart NIC accelerators. We prototype Hazel on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate that it can achieve as little as 1-2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns, AI training, IO500, and YCSB.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Logic Synthesis: Spectral Coefficient Selection via Sinkhorn-Constrained Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to "fuzzy" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.
  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows. All operations enable single-cycle combinational logic inference at 10,959 MOps/s on GPU, demonstrating viability for hardware-efficient neuro-symbolic logic synthesis.</description>
