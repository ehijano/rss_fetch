      <title>Long-Run Sovereign Debt Composition: An Analytic Ergodic Framework with Explicit Maturity Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a discrete-time model of regularly-issued sovereign debt dynamics under a deficit-driven nominal debt growth regime that explicitly accounts for granular maturity. New issuance follows fixed allocations across a finite maturity ladder, and the government budget constraint determines total borrowing endogenously. In the deterministic baseline, we identify a sustainability condition for convergence to a steady-state and derive closed-form steady portfolio shares, as well as key metrics for steady cost and risk (proxied as one-period rollover ratio). Extending the model to a stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) driven by interest rates and (normalized) deficits that are stationary and mean-reverting, and using a future-cashflow state representation of debt, we identify an analogous condition for ergodic convergence to a unique invariant distribution. This implies that metrics calculated by Monte Carlo debt simulations driven by factors with these properties will recover the ergodic means of the underlying system, independently of initial conditions, provided the simulation horizon is sufficiently long. Analytical formulae for expectations of certain key metrics under this invariant distribution are derived, and agreement with simulation is observed. We find that the introduction of stochastic interest-rate/deficit correlation into the framework leads to intuitive correction terms to their deterministic-baseline counterparts.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridges with jumps for time series generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generative modeling for time series using entropic optimal transport and the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) framework, with a focus on applications in finance and energy modeling. Extending the diffusion-based approach of Hamdouche, Henry-Labord\`ere, Pham, 2023, we introduce a jump-diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge model that allows for discontinuities in the generative dynamics. Starting from a Schr\"odinger bridge entropy minimization problem, we reformulate the task as a stochastic control problem whose solution characterizes the optimal controlled jump-diffusion process. When sampled on a fixed time grid, this process generates synthetic time series matching the joint distributions of the observed data. The model is fully data-driven, as both the drift and the jump intensity are learned directly from the data. We propose practical algorithms for training, sampling, and hyperparameter calibration. Numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets, including financial and energy time series, show that incorporating jumps substantially improves the realism of the generated data, in particular by capturing abrupt movements, heavy tails, and regime changes that diffusion-only models fail to reproduce. Comparisons with state-of-the-art generative models highlight the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization of financial markets: a mean-field game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a financial market model in which a large population of firms chooses dynamic emission strategies under climate transition risk, interacting with both environmentally concerned and neutral investors. Firms face a trade-off between financial returns and environmental performance, while their decisions are coupled through an equilibrium stochastic discount factor determined by investors' portfolio allocations. The framework is formulated as a mean-field game, for which we establish existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium among firms. We propose a convergent numerical scheme to compute the equilibrium and use it to study how climate transition risk and green-minded investors affect decarbonization dynamics and asset prices. Our results show that uncertainty about future climate risks and policies increases aggregate emissions and widens valuation spreads between green and brown firms. Although environmentally concerned investors can partially offset these effects by raising the cost of capital for high-emission firms and incentivizing emission reductions, policy uncertainty weakens their impact. Even a large share of green-minded investors is insufficient to reverse emission growth when future climate policies are unclear, highlighting the crucial role of credible and predictable climate policy in enabling financial markets to support decarbonization.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics of Trading Boundary in Finite Horizon Portfolio Selection with Proportional Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Merton's problem with proportional transaction costs. It is well known that the optimal investment strategy is characterized by two trading boundaries, the buy boundary and the sell boundary, between which lies the no-trading region. We investigate how these two trading boundaries vary with the transaction cost rates. We show that the cost-adjusted trading boundaries are monotone in the transaction costs. Our result implies the following: (i) the Merton line must lie between the two cost-adjusted trading boundaries; and (ii) when the Merton line is positive, both the buy and sell boundaries are monotone in the transaction cost rates, and consequently the Merton line lies in the no-trading region.</description>

      <title>The additive Bachelier model with an application to the oil option market in the Covid period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In April 2020, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange temporarily switched the pricing formula for West Texas Intermediate oil market options from the Black model to the Bachelier model. In this context, we introduce an additive Bachelier model that provides a simple closed-form solution and a good description of the implied volatility surface. This new additive model exhibits several notable mathematical and financial properties. It ensures the no-arbitrage condition, a critical requirement in highly volatile markets, while also enabling a parsimonious synthesis of the volatility surface. The model features only three parameters, each with a clear financial interpretation: the volatility term structure, the vol-of-vol, and a parameter for modelling skew. Model calibration can follow a cascade procedure: first, it accurately replicates the term structures of forwards and At-The-Money volatilities observed in the market; second, it fits the smile of the volatility surface. The proposed model also supports efficient pricing of path-dependent exotic options via Monte Carlo simulation, using a straightforward and computationally efficient approach. Overall, this model provides a robust and parsimonious description of the oil option market during the exceptionally volatile first period of the Covid-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Asian option valuation under price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a tractable framework for valuing Asian options when trading the underlying generates market impact and execution costs. Starting from a discrete-time, quote-level model, we construct a reference midpoint suitable for Asian payoffs and separate market impact into a transient component and a permanent drift distortion driven by signed trading. This specification admits continuous-time limits where the midpoint and impact state converge to a coupled system in which the midpoint drift depends on the transient impact state and in the endogenous regime on the hedger's trading rate, with correlated price and order-flow shocks.
  We study valuation in two complementary regimes. In an exogenous benchmark, the impact state evolves independently of the hedger. When the order-flow volatility is deterministic, we obtain a closed-form expression for the geometric Asian call. In an endogenous regime, trading volumes feed back into prices and costs, leading to a stochastic control problem and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We define reservation bid and ask prices via cost-based indifference which produces an impact-driven bid-ask spread. For computations, we propose a CRR-style tree-based Bellman algorithm. Numerical experiments show that exogenous impact effects are modest relative to frictionless benchmarks, while endogenous indifference prices generate nontrivial bid-ask spreads that grow super-linearly in impact parameters, widen when execution costs are lower, and shrink with faster mean reversion, highlighting the interaction between averaging in Asian options, price impact effects, and strategic trading.</description>

      <title>A quickest detection problem with false negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a variant of the quickest detection problem which features false negatives. A standard Brownian motion acquires a drift at an independent exponential random time which is not directly observable. Based on the observation in continuous time of the sample path of the process, an optimizer must detect the drift as quickly as possible after it has appeared. The optimizer can inspect the system multiple times upon payment of a fixed cost per inspection. If a test is performed on the system before the drift has appeared then, naturally, the test will return a negative outcome. However, if a test is performed after the drift has appeared, then the test may fail to detect it and return a false negative with probability $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. The optimisation ends when the drift is eventually detected. The problem is formulated mathematically as an optimal multiple stopping problem, and it is shown to be equivalent to a recursive optimal stopping problem. Exploiting such connection and free boundary methods we find explicit formulae for the expected cost and the optimal strategy. We also show that when $\epsilon = 0$ our expected cost is an affine transformation of the one in Shiryaev's classical optimal detection problem with a rescaled model parameter.</description>

      <title>Smile asymptotics for Bachelier implied volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the implied volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the large-strike results established for the Black-Scholes framework. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier implied volatility in the wings of the smile, directly linking them to the tail decay of the underlying returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a rigorous connection between the analyticity strip of the characteristic function and the asymptotic slope of the volatility smile. Moreover, we show that if the implied variance grows linearly for large absolute moneyness degree, the underlying returns' distribution must exhibit exponential tail decay, and the corresponding characteristic function is analytic in a horizontal strip of the complex plane. These findings characterizes valid models based solely on the observable asymptotic behaviour of the smile.</description>
