      <title>Machine-learned trends in mirror configurations in the Large Plasma Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the efficacy of ML-based trend inference using data from the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). The LAPD is a flexible basic plasma science device with a high discharge repetition rate (0.25-1 Hz) and reproducible plasmas capable of collecting high-spatial-resolution probe measurements. A diverse dataset is collected through random sampling of LAPD operational parameters, including the magnetic field strength and profile, fueling settings, and the discharge voltage. NN ensembles with uncertainty quantification are trained to predict time-averaged ion saturation current ($I_\text{sat}$ -- proportional to density and the square root of electron temperature) at any position within the dataset domain. Model-inferred trends, such as the effects of introducing mirrors or changing the discharge voltage, are consistent with current understanding. In addition, axial variation is optimized via comprehensive search over $I_\text{sat}$ predictions. Experimental validation of these optimized machine parameters demonstrate qualitative agreement, with quantitative differences attributable to Langmuir probe variation and cathode conditions. This investigation demonstrates, using ML techniques, a new way of extracting insight from experiments and novel optimization of plasmas. The code and data used in this study are made freely available.</description>

      <title>Enhanced MVA of Polarized Proton Beams via PW Laser-Driven Plasma Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of laser-driven polarized beam acceleration has been increasingly recognized in recent years. We propose an efficient method for generating polarized proton beams from a pre-polarized hydrogen halide gas jet, utilizing magnetic vortex acceleration enhanced by a laser-driven plasma bubble. When a petawatt laser pulse passes through a pre-polarized gas jet, a bubble-like ultra-nonlinear plasma wave is formed. As part of the wave particles, background protons are swept by the acceleration field of the bubble and oscillate significantly along the laser propagation axis. Some of the pre-accelerated protons in the plasma wave are trapped by the acceleration field at the rear side of the target. This acceleration field is intensified by the transverse expansion of the laser-driven magnetic vortex, resulting in energetic polarized proton beams. The spin of energetic protons is determined by their precession within the electromagnetic field, as described by the Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation in analytical models and particle-in-cell simulations. Multidimensional simulations reveal that monoenergetic proton beams with hundreds of MeV in energy, a beam charge of hundreds of pC, and a beam polarization of tens of percent can be produced at laser powers of several petawatts. Laser-driven polarized proton beams offer promising potential for application in polarized beam colliders, where they can be utilized to investigate particle interactions and to explore the properties of matter under unique conditions.</description>

      <title>R-JET: A postprocessing code for radiative transport in relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a post-processing radiative transport code for computing the spectra, the coreshift, and the surface-brightness distribution of special relativistic jets with arbitrary optical thickness. The jet consists of an electron-positron pair plasma and an electron-proton normal plasma. Electrons and positrons are relativistic and composed of thermal and nonthermal components, while protons are non-relativistic and non-radiating. The fraction of a pair plasma, as well as the fraction of a nonthermal component can be arbitrarily chosen. Only the synchrotron process is considered for emission and absorption when the radiative-transfer equation is integrated along our lines of sight. We describe a suite of test problems, and confirm the frequency dependence of the coreshift in the Konigl jet model, when the plasma is composed of nonthermal component alone. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the code with model calculations, demonstrating that the jet will exhibit a limb-brightened structure in general when it is energized by the rotational energy of the black hole. It is also demonstrated that such limb-brightened jets show a ring-like structure in the brightness map when we observe the jet launching region nearly face-on.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observations of Pickup Ion Mediated Shocks to 60 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a detailed analysis of fourteen distant interplanetary shocks observed by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument onboard New Horizons. These shocks were observed with a pickup ion data cadence of approximately 30 minutes, covering a heliocentric distance range of ~52-60 au. All the shocks observed within this distance range are fast-forward shocks, and the shock compression ratios vary between ~1.2 and 1.9. The shock transition scales are generally narrow, and the SW density compressions are more pronounced compared to the previous study of seven shocks by McComas et al. (2022). A majority (64%) of these shocks have upstream sonic Mach numbers greater than one. In addition, all high-resolution measurements of distant interplanetary shocks analyzed here show that the shock transition scale is independent of the shock compression ratio. However, the shock transition scale is strongly anti-correlated with the shock speed in the upstream plasma frame, meaning that faster shocks generally yield sharper transitions.</description>

      <title>Ionization memory of plasma emiters in a solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. In the low-collisional, partially ionized plasma (PIP) of solar prominences, uncharged emitters might show different signatures of magnetic line broadening than charged emitters. We investigate if the widths of weak metall emissions in prominences exceed the thermal line broadening by a different amount for charged and for uncharged emitters.
  Methods. We simultaneously observe five optically thin, weak metall lines in the brightness center of a quiescent prominence and compare their observed widths with the thermal broadening.
  Results. The inferred non-thermal broadening of the metall lines does not indicate systematic differences between the uncharged Mg b2 and Na D1 and the charged Fe II emitters, only Sr II is broader.
  Conclusions. The additional line broadening of charged emitters is reasonably attributed to magnetic forces. That of uncharged emitters can then come from their temporary state as ion before recombination. Magnetically induced velocities will retain some time after recombination. Modelling partially ionized plasmas then requires consideration of a memory of previous ionization states.</description>

      <title>Exploring the operational limits of poloidal and helical arrays of Mirnov coils in stellarators by means of a synthetic diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic Mirnov coils diagnostic for non-axisymmetric magnetic configurations is presented and used to study the capabilities of the poloidal array of single-axis coils and the two helical arrays of tri-axial coils installed in the TJ-II stellarator. This tool integrates the plasma currents induced by Alfv\'en-like perturbations of the electric potential inside the plasma and provides the induced magnetic field oscillations anywhere outside of it. The simulated signals can then be analyzed in the same manner as the experimental ones, and a scan on the radial position and width of the potential perturbation is conducted to find the limiting values that produce identifiable signals. We find, not surprisingly, that core-localized modes are indistinguishable from one another; and that the identification of low-n, low-m modes is often subject to off-by-one errors. We also determine the optimal polarization basis in which to analyze the tri-axial coils signals and address the diagnostic performance when resolving components of gap modes. Additionally, selected cases have been analyzed with a simplified plasma response model, showing that plasma shielding of the mode currents may further deteriorate the accuracy of the mode identification method. We conclude with the analysis of an experimental case taken from the TJ-II database to illustrate the usefulness of the diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and transport in mirror geometries in the Large Plasma Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to advances in plasma science and enabling technology, mirror machines are being reconsidered for fusion power plants and as possible fusion volumetric neutron sources. However cross-field transport and turbulence in mirrors remains relatively understudied compared to toroidal devices. Turbulence and transport in mirror configurations were studied utilizing the flexible magnetic geometry of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). Multiple mirror ratios from $ M = 1 $ to $ M = 2.68 $ and three mirror-cell lengths from $L = 3.51 $m to $ L = 10.86 $m were examined. Langmuir and magnetic probes were used to measure profiles of density, temperature, potential, and magnetic field. The fluctuation-driven $ \tilde{ E } \times B $ particle flux was calculated from these quantities. Two probe correlation techniques were used to infer wavenumbers and two-dimensional structure. Cross-field particle flux and density fluctuation power decreased with increased mirror ratio. Core density and temperatures remain similar with mirror ratio, but radial line-integrated density increased. The physical expansion of the plasma in the mirror cell by using a higher field in the source region may have led to reduced density fluctuation power through the increased gradient scale length. This increased scale length reduced the growth rate and saturation level of rotational interchange and drift-like instabilities. Despite the introduction of magnetic curvature, no evidence of mirror driven instabilities -- interchange, velocity space, or otherwise -- were observed. For curvature-induced interchange, many possible stabilization mechanisms were present, suppressing the visibility of the instability.</description>

      <title>Characterization of NBI-driven shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator using Mirnov probes and electrostatic potential fluctuation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform ($\iota/2\pi$) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfv\'en eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in $\iota/2\pi$, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\'en continuum for selected cases using \texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.</description>

      <title>Induced Compton scattering in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.</description>
