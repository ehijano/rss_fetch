      <title>Myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using multi-inversion recovery real-time spoiled GRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an accurate myocardial T1 mapping technique at 5T using Look-Locker-based multiple inversion-recovery with the real-time spoiled gradient echo (GRE) acquisition. Methods: The proposed T1 mapping technique (mIR-rt) samples the recovery of inverted magnetization using the real-time GRE and the images captured during diastole are selected for T1 fitting. Multiple-inversion recoveries are employed to increase the sample size for accurate fitting. Furthermore, the inversion pulse (IR) was tailored for cardiac imaging at 5T, optimized to maximize the inversion efficiency over specified ranges of B1 and off-resonance. The T1 mapping method was validated using Bloch simulation, phantom studies, and in 16 healthy volunteers at 5T. Results: The optimized IR pulse based on the tangent/hyperbolic tangent pulse was found to outperform the conventional hyperbolic secant IR pulse within a limited peak amplitude of 10.6 {\mu}T at the 5T scanner. This optimized IR pulse achieves an average inversion factor of 0.9014 within a B0 range of +/-250Hz and a B1 range of -50% to 20%. In both simulation and phantom studies, the T1 values measured by mIR-rt closely approximate the reference T1 values, with errors less than 3%, while the conventional MOLLI sequence underestimates T1 values. The myocardial T1 values at 5T are 1553 +/- 52 ms, 1531 +/- 53 ms, and 1526 +/- 60 ms (mean +/- standard deviation) at the apex, middle, and base, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed method is feasible for myocardial T1 mapping at 5T and provides better accuracy than the conventional MOLLI sequence.

      <title>Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging Using Probabilistic Inversion: Leveraging Variational Inference for Speed Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a promising technique for achieving high-resolution imaging in medical ultrasound. Traditional FWI methods suffer from issues related to computational efficiency, dependence on initial models, and the inability to quantify uncertainty. This study introduces the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm into FWI, aiming to improve inversion performance and enhance uncertainty quantification. By deriving the posterior gradient, the study explores the integration of SVGD with FWI and demonstrates its ability to approximate complex priors. In-silico experiments with synthetic data and real-world breast tissue data highlight the advantages of the SVGD-based framework over conventional FWI. SVGD-based FWI improves inversion quality, provides more reliable uncertainty quantification, and offers a tighter bound for the prior distribution. These findings show that probabilistic inversion is a promising tool for addressing the limitations of traditional FWI methods in ultrasonic imaging of medical tissues.</description>
