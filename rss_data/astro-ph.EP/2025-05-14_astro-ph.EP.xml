      <title>A third star in the HAT-P-7 system, and a new dynamical pathway to misaligned hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The retrograde orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is suggestive of high-eccentricity migration caused by dynamical interactions with a massive companion. However, the only other known body in the system is an M dwarf located $\sim$10$^3$~AU away, too distant to cause high-eccentricity migration without fine tuning. Here we present transit-timing and radial-velocity evidence for an additional stellar companion with semi-major axis $32^{+16}_{-11}$~AU, eccentricity $0.76^{+0.12}_{-0.26}$, and minimum mass $0.19^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$~$\rm M_\odot$. We investigate several dynamical routes by which this nearby companion star could have played a role in converting a cold Jupiter into the retrograde hot Jupiter that is observed today. Of particular interest is a novel "eccentricity cascade" mechanism involving both of the companion stars: the outer companion periodically excites the eccentricity of the inner companion through von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles, and this eccentricity excitation is slowly transferred to the cold Jupiter via successive close encounters, eventually triggering its high-eccentricity migration. The plausibility of this mechanism in explaining HAT-P-7b shows that stellar companions traditionally considered too distant to cause hot Jupiter formation might nevertheless be responsible, with the aid of closer-orbiting massive companions. With these developments, HAT-P-7b is one of the few hot Jupiters for which a complete high-eccentricity migration history can be simulated based only on observed bodies, rather than invoking bodies that are beneath detection limits or that are no longer in the system.</description>

      <title>Origin of the asymmetric gas distribution near the co-orbital Lagrange points of an embedded planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions often show material accumulation near the co-orbital Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ -- features that may correspond to observed crescents in protoplanetary disks. Intriguingly, these simulations also show an asymmetrical distribution of gas between $L_4$ and $L_5$, whose physical origin is not yet understood and could allow to further constrain the inner workings of planet-disk interactions. We performed 2D hydrodynamic simulations of a single, non-migrating planet embedded in a gaseous disk to investigate this effect. We find that the asymmetry is solely controlled by the sign of the radial temperature gradient with positive gradients enhancing the accumulation at $L_4$ and negative ones enhancing $L_5$. A symmetric distribution is recovered on globally isothermal disks. Furthermore, we find that the azimuthal locations of $L_4$ and $L_5$ deviate from the classical circular restricted three-body problem, following a monotonic trend with the disk pressure scale height $h_{\rm p}$: $\phi_{\text{max}}\approx\pm60^{\circ}[1+0.18(h_{\rm p}^3M_\star/m_{\rm p})^{2/3}]$. Our simulations show that the longest-lived and largest-amplitude structures are produced by planets opening gaps with depths $\Sigma_{\rm gap}/\Sigma_0\lesssim 0.2$. We successfully reproduce the observed asymmetry using a semi-analytical model that incorporates the azimuthally asymmetric radial velocity background induced by the planet. Overall, our results suggest that asymmetries in the form of crescents and clumps inside of density gaps opened by planets can constrain the local thermodynamic properties of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Propagation and transmission of Jupiter's internal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.</description>

      <title>An MHD-based model for wind-driven disc-planet interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary discs with planets typically assume that the disc is viscously driven, even though magnetic disc winds are now considered the primary driver of angular momentum transport through the disc. Magnetic disc winds are typically left out of hydrodynamic simulations because they require a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) treatment and an entire 3D domain, both of which are computationally expensive. Some studies have attempted to incorporate disc winds into disc-planet simulations without full MHD by adding a torque to mimic the effects of a disc wind. However, these studies predate any explicit 3D MHD simulations of planets in the presence of a disc wind. In light of recent MHD studies of disc winds beginning to include a planet, we develop a new disc wind prescription based on these studies and test its efficacy. With three main components, namely (i) excess torque in the planetary gap region, (ii) an MHD-based radial profile for the background torque, and (iii) a moderate level of viscosity, we find that we can essentially reproduce planetary gap profiles for planets above the thermal mass. With lower-mass planets, however, we find it more difficult to reproduce their gap structure. Lastly, we explore the planet's migration path and find that the planet rapidly migrates inwards due to the excess torque in the gap.</description>

      <title>Polar motion of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling spin dynamics analyses to infer geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion -- the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame-focusing on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support its potential detection by future orbiters. We develop a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects are analyzed separately considering a simplified spherical core. We compute the period and damping time of the free motion -- called the Chandler wobble -- and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisit the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240-meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. It should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on Venus's interior structure.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): overview of program and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Orbit and Dynamical Masses of GJ 105 AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision of stellar models is higher than the precision at which we are able to measure the masses of most stars, with the notable exception of binaries where we can determine dynamical masses of the component stars. In addition to well-measured stellar properties, the ideal benchmark star is far enough from its companion that its properties are indistinguishable from an otherwise identical single star. Currently, there are a handful of stars with precise ($\pm$3 %), model-independent mass measurements that are "effectively single" and for which we can obtain clean spectra (i.e. spectra that are not blended with a close companion). In this paper, we introduce GJ 105 AC as the newest members of this exclusive population. We present an updated orbital analysis for the long-period K3+M7 binary GJ 105 AC. We jointly analyze radial velocity (RV) and relative astrometry data, including new RVs from the Miniature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) that capture the full periapsis passage and the RV minimum of the $76.0 \pm 1.3$ yr orbit for the first time. We derive precise dynamical masses of $M_1 = 0.78 \pm 0.02\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.098 \pm 0.002\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. We find that of all stars with similarly precise masses (~2%), GJ 105 AC stands out as having the widest on-sky separation after $\alpha$ Centauri AB, making it one of the most easily accessible to spectroscopy, as well as the the second-widest true separation, ensuring that its members are truly "effectively single" in terms of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Hints of Disk Substructure in the First Brown Dwarf with a Dynamical Mass Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ALMA observations at 0.89 mm of the Class II brown dwarf 2MASS J04442713+2512164 (2M0444), achieving a spatial resolution of 0$.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$046 ($\sim$6.4 au at the distance to the source). These observations targeted continuum emission together with $^{12}$CO (3-2) molecular line. The line emission traces a Keplerian disk, allowing us to derive a dynamical mass between 0.043-0.092 M${_{\odot}}$ for the central object. We constrain the gas-to-dust disk size ratio to be $\sim$7, consistent with efficient radial drift. However, the observed dust emission suggest that a dust trap is present, enough to retain some dust particles. We perform visibility fitting of the continuum emission, and under the assumption of annular substructure, our best fit shows a gap and a ring at 98.1$^{+4.2}_{-8.4}$ mas ($\sim$14 au) and 116.0$^{+4.2}_{-4.8}$ mas ($\sim$16 au), respectively, with a gap width of 20 mas ($\sim$3 au). To ensure robustness, the data were analyzed through a variety of methods in both the image and uv plane, employing multiple codes and approaches. This tentative disk structure could be linked to a possible planetary companion in the process of formation. These results provide the first dynamical mass of the lowest mass object to date, together with the possible direct detection of a substructure, offering new insights into disk dynamics and planet formation in the very low-mass regime. Future higher spatial resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm these findings and further investigate the link between substructures and planet formation in brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>CHEOPS Ground Segment: Systems and Automation for Mission and Science Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CHEOPS, the first ESA small-class mission, has been performing photometric astronomical observations with a particular emphasis on exoplanetary science for the past five years. A distinctive feature of CHEOPS is that the responsibility for all operational aspects of the mission lies with the consortium rather than ESA. As a result, all subsystems, their architecture, and operational processes have been independently developed and tailored specifically to CHEOPS. This paper offers an overview of the CHEOPS operational subsystems, the design, and the automation framework that compose the two main components of the CHEOPS ground segment: the MOC and the SOC. This comprehensive description of the CHEOPS workflow aims to serve as a reference and potential source of inspiration for future small and/or independent space missions.</description>

Abstract: The detection and characterisation of other "Earths", orbiting other suns, is a bold objective of present-day astrophysics. However, this quest is severely challenged by astrophysical "noise" from the host stars, whose signatures distort the observed spectra. Motivated by this problem, we are building a dedicated facility, the Paranal solar ESPRESSO Telescope (PoET). PoET will collect solar light and channel it into the ESPRESSO spectrograph, allowing us to use the Sun as a proxy to unambiguously identify and understand the sources of relevant variability in solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Extreme Weather Variability on Hot Rocky Exoplanet 55 Cancri e Explained by Magma Temperature-Cloud Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the hot rocky exoplanet 55 Cancri e report significant but unexplained variability in brightness across visible and infrared bands, e.g., on sub-weekly timescales, its mid-infrared brightness temperature fluctuates by approximately 1400 K (with hundreds of Kelvin uncertainty). We propose a magma temperature-cloud feedback as a potential explanation that relies on the planet's atmosphere and surface. In this feedback, under cloud-free conditions, stellar radiation heats surface magma, releasing silicate vapor that condenses into clouds. Once formed, these clouds attenuate stellar insolation, thereby cooling the surface, reducing vapor supply, and decreasing cloudiness. A time lag between surface temperature increase and cloud formation, likely due to lagged atmospheric transport of cloud-forming vapor, enables self-sustained oscillations in surface temperature and cloudiness. These oscillations manifest as variations in both the planet's thermal emission and reflected starlight, causing variability in secondary eclipse depths across wavelengths without significantly affecting the transit depth. Using a simple model, we find that diverse planetary parameters can reproduce the observed infrared brightness variability. We also demonstrate that brightness at different wavelengths can oscillate out of phase, consistent with recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope. Additionally, we propose that time-varying and spatially non-uniform cloud cover can result in changing amplitude and phase offset of the planet's phase curve, potentially explaining observations. Finally, we discuss observational strategies to test this proposed mechanism on 55 Cancri e. If confirmed, these observable ocean-atmosphere dynamics on exoplanets would provide valuable insights into the composition, evolution, and long-term fate of rocky planet volatiles.</description>

Abstract: Fractures and vents in the ice crust of Europa, exposing the sub-surface ocean or liquid-water inclusions to the vacuum, might be responsible for the generation of water-vapor plumes. During its passage through the ice, the plume vapor is expected to partially condense on the cold ice walls. Together with other effects (water spillage, compression forces, etc.) this mechanism likely contributes to sealing the vent. In this work, we develop a simple lumped-parameter model that can quantify how quickly a hypothetical vent of prescribed width would be sealed via water-vapor deposition. As an example, we apply our model to the vent size and density conditions inferred from the 2012 Hubble Space Telescope plume detection, predicting a sealing time of about 30 minutes. This suggests that the actual ice fracture might have been larger than originally proposed and/or the plume density at the vent might have been lower. While many other effects could have been present and responsible for sealing the vent, our estimates indicate that vapor deposition might have played a major role in eventually shutting off the observed plume. A map of sealing times vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume quantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a given plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by vapor deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Dust Concentration Via Coupled Vertical Settling and Radial Migration in Substructured Non-Ideal MHD Discs and Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dust concentration in actively accreting, substructured, non-ideal MHD wind-launching disks using 2D and 3D simulations incorporating pressureless dust fluids of various grain sizes and their aerodynamic feedback on gas dynamics. Our results reveal that mm/cm-sized grains are preferentially concentrated within the inner 5-10 au of the disk, where the dust-to-gas surface density ratio (local metalicity Z) significantly exceeds the canonical 0.01, reaching values up to 0.25. This enhancement arises from the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional plane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion driven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous meridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings. The resulting size-dependent dust distribution has a strong spatial variation, with large grains preferentially accumulating in dense rings, particularly in the inner disk, while being depleted in low-density gas gaps. In 3D, these rings and gaps are unstable to Rossby wave instability (RWI), generating arc-shaped vortices that stand out more prominently than their gas counterparts in the inner disk because of preferential dust concentration at small radii. The substantial local enhancement of the dust relative to the gas could promote planetesimal formation via streaming instability, potentially aided by the "azimuthal drift" streaming instability (AdSI) that operates efficiently in accreting disks and a lower Toomre Q expected in younger disks. Our findings suggest that actively accreting young disks may provide favorable conditions for early planetesimal formation, which warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Formation Models with New Dynamical Masses for the PDS 70 Protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot- and cold-start planet formation models predict differing luminosities for the young, bright planets that direct imaging surveys are most sensitive to. However, precise mass estimates are required to distinguish between these models observationally. The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b and c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for dynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently poorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these planets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for c. Adding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our model, we determine $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 7.5 $M_{\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d respectively. However, $N$-body analysis of the orbits fit in this case suggest that the inclusion of $d$ makes the system unstable. Using the upper mass limits for b and c we rule out the coldest-start formation models for both planets, calculating minimum post-formation entropies ($S_i$) of 9.5 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ and 8.4 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ respectively. This places PDS 70 b and c on the growing list of directly-imaged planets inconsistent with cold-start formation.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. The catalog's selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in its construction. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. This is a complementary approach to the more accurate but significantly more computationally expensive approach of El-Badry et al. (2024). We also construct a binary population synthesis model to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1 and BH2, and find them to be 0.38 and 0.27, respectively. Compared to the values obtained by detailed modeling in El-Badry et al. (2024), the probabilities are identical for BH1, and within a factor of 2 for BH2. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 3000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $&lt; 800$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $&lt; 12,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1500$ day.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>
