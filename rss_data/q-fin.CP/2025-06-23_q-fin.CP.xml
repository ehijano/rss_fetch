      <title>Empirical Models of the Time Evolution of SPX Option Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key objective of this paper is to develop an empirical model for pricing SPX options that can be simulated over future paths of the SPX. To accomplish this, we formulate and rigorously evaluate several statistical models, including neural network, random forest, and linear regression. These models use the observed characteristics of the options as inputs -- their price, moneyness and time-to-maturity, as well as a small set of external inputs, such as the SPX and its past history, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate. Model evaluation is performed on historical options data, spanning 30 years of daily observations. Significant effort is given to understanding the data and ensuring explainability for the neural network. A neural network model with two hidden layers and four neurons per layer, trained with minimal hyperparameter tuning, performs well against the theoretical Black-Scholes-Merton model for European options, as well as two other empirical models based on the random forest and the linear regression. It delivers arbitrage-free option prices without requiring these conditions to be imposed.</description>

      <title>American options valuation in time-dependent jump-diffusion models via integral equations and characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in machine learning for derivative pricing, the efficient and accurate valuation of American options remains a persistent challenge due to complex exercise boundaries, near-expiry behavior, and intricate contractual features. This paper extends a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models, including pure diffusions, jump-diffusions, and Levy processes. Building on prior work, we derive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine the exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior alternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We address key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e. splitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early exercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases where closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging characteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the framework to multidimensional diffusions. Numerical examples demonstrate the method's efficiency and robustness. Our results underscore the advantages of the integral equation approach for large-scale industrial applications, while resolving some limitations of existing techniques.</description>

      <title>FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.</description>
