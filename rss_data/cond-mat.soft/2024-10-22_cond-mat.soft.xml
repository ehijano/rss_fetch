      <title>Surface Furrowing Instability in Everting Soft Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a surface instability observed during the extrusion of extremely soft elastic solids in confined geometries. Due to their unique rheological properties, these soft solids can migrate through narrow gaps by continuously everting the bulk material. The extrusion front spontaneously buckles in the direction transverse to the flow, resulting in a furrow-like morphology that deepens over time. We characterize the distinct features of this instability using experiments and theory and contrast the results with known elastic surface instabilities. Our study may provide insights into various processes involving the extrusion-like deformations of soft solids, including biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Knitting Multistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved elastic shells can be fabricated through molding or by harnessing residual stresses. These shells often exhibit snap-through behavior and multistability when loaded. We present a unique way of fabricating curved elastic shells that exhibit multistability and snap-through behavior, weft-knitting. The knitting process introduces internal stresses into the textile sheet, which leads to complex 3D curvatures. We explore the relationship between the geometry and the mechanical response, identifying a parameter space where the textiles are multistable. We harness the snapping behavior and shape change through multistability to design soft conductive switches with built-in haptic feedback, and incorporate these textile switches into wearable devices. This work will allow us to harness the nonlinear mechanical behavior of textiles to create functional, soft, and seamless wearable devices. This includes but is not limited to the devices for additional cycling visibility and safety that we envision.</description>

      <title>Long-range order in two-dimensional systems with fluctuating active stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional tissues, such as developing germ layers, pair-wise forces (or active stresses) arise from the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton, with dissipation provided by the three-dimensional surroundings. We show analytically how these pair-wise stochastic forces, unlike the particle-wise independent fluctuating forces usually considered in active matter systems, produce conserved centre-of-mass dynamics and so are able to damp large-wavelength displacement fluctuations in elastic systems. A consequence of this is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions, in clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence of hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \sim q^2$ in the $q \to 0$ limit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these pair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is represented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions and with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an active disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of equal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We confirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models and show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus constituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of this mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and to also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ligand vs. Linker on Phase Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle gels have attracted considerable attention due to their highly tunable properties. One strategy for producing nanoparticle gels involves utilizing strong local attractions between polymeric molecules, such as DNA hybridization or dynamic covalent chemistry, to form percolated nanoparticle networks. These molecules can be used in two distinct roles: as ``ligands'' with one end grafted to a nanoparticle or as ``linkers'' with both ends free. Here, we explore how these roles shape the phase behavior and mechanical properties of gel-like nanoparticle assemblies using coarse-grained simulations. We systematically vary the interaction strength and bending stiffness of both ligands and linkers. We find that phase separation can be limited to low nanoparticle volume fractions by making the ligands rigid, consistent with previous studies on linked nanoparticle gels. At fixed interaction strength and volume fraction, both ligand- and linker-mediated nanoparticle assemblies show similar mechanical responses to variations in bending stiffness. However, a comparison between the two association schemes reveals that the linked nanoparticles form rigid percolated networks that are less stretchable than the ligand-grafted gels, despite exhibiting similar tensile strength. We attribute these differences between ligands and linkers to the distinct structural arrangement of nanoparticles. Our findings highlight the potential to utilize different association schemes to tune specific mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Tuning the shear and extensional rheology of semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-flexible polyelectrolytes are a group of biopolymers with a wide range of applications from drag reducing agents in turbulent flows to thickening agents in food and cosmetics. In this study, we investigate the rheology of aqueous solutions of xanthan gum as a canonical semi-flexible polyelectrolyte in steady shear and transient extensional flows via torsional rheometry and dripping-onto-substrate (DoS), respectively. The high molecular weight of the xanthan gum and the numerous charged groups on the side branches attached to the backbone allow the shear and extensional rheology of the xanthan gum solutions to be tuned over a wide range by changing the ionic strength of the solvent. In steady shear flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration increases both the zero shear viscosity and the extent of shear-thinning of the solution. Conversely, increasing the ionic strength of the solvent by addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) decreases both the zero shear viscosity and the level of shear-thinning. In transient extensional flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration changes the dynamics of the capillary thinning from an inelastic power-law (IP) response to an elastocapillary (EC) balance, from which an extensional relaxation time can be measured based on the rate of filament thinning. Increasing the NaCl concentration decreases the extensional relaxation time and the transient extensional viscosity of the viscoelastic solution. Based on the dynamics of capillary thinning observed in the DoS experiments, we provide a relationship for the smallest extensional relaxation time that can be measured using DoS. We suggest that the change in the dynamics of capillary thinning from an IP response to an EC response can be used as an easy and robust experimental method for identifying the rheologically effective overlap concentration of a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solution, i.e., the critical concentration at which polymer molecules start to interact with each other to produce a viscoelastic strain-stiffening response (often perceived as "stringiness") in transient extensional flows such as those involved in dripping, dispensing and filling operations.</description>

      <title>Unifying homogeneous and inhomogeneous rheology of dense suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheology of dense suspensions lacks a universal description due to the involvement of a wide variety of parameters, ranging from the physical properties of solid particles to the nature of the external deformation or applied stress. While the former controls microscopic interactions, spatial variations in the latter induce heterogeneity in the flow, making it difficult to find suitable constitutive laws to describe the rheology in a unified way. For homogeneous driving with a spatially uniform strain rate, the rheology of non-Brownian dense suspensions is well described by the conventional $\mu(J)$ rheology. However, this rheology fails in the inhomogeneous case due to non-local effects, where the flow in one region is influenced by the flow in another. Here, motivated by observations from simulation data, we introduce a new dimensionless number, the suspension temperature $\Theta_s$, which contains information on local particle velocity fluctuations. We find that $\mu(J,\Theta_s)$ provides a unified description for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows. By employing scaling theory, we identify a set of constitutive laws for dense suspensions of frictional spherical particles and frictionless rod-shaped particles. Combining these scaling relations with the momentum balance equation for our model system, we predict the spatial variation of the relevant dimensionless numbers, the volume fraction $\phi$, the viscous number $J$, the macroscopic friction coefficient $\mu$, and $\Theta_s$ solely from the nature of the imposed external driving.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and self-assembly of free capillary spinners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active particles are able to draw energy from the environment to self-propel in the form of rotation. We describe an experimental arrangement wherein chiral objects, spinners, floating on the surface of a vibrated fluid rotate due to emitted capillary waves. We observe that pairs of spinners can assemble at quantized distances via the mutually generated wavefield, phase synchronize and, in some circumstances, globally rotate about a point midway between them. A mathematical model based on wave-mediated interactions captures the salient features of the assembly and synchronization while a qualitative argument is able to rationalize global rotations based on interference and radiation stress associated with the wavefield. Extensions to larger collections are demonstrated, highlighting the potential for this tabletop system to be used as an experimental system capable of synchronizing and swarming.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Network analysis of optical texture patterns in liquid-crystal skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystals are known for their optical birefringence, a property that gives rise to intricate patterns and colors when viewed in a microscope between crossed polarisers. Resulting images are rich in geometric patterns and serve as valuable fingerprints of the liquid crystal's intrinsic properties. By using machine learning techniques, it is possible to extract from the images information about, e.g., liquid crystal elastic constants, the scalar order parameter, local orientation of the director, etc. Machine learning can also be employed to identify phase transitions and classify different liquid crystalline phases and topological defects. In addition to well studied singular defects such as point or line disclinations, liquid crystals can also host non-singular solitonic defects such as skyrmions, hopfions, and torons. The solitons, with their localised and stable configurations, offer an alternative view into material properties and behaviour of liquid crystals. In this study, we demonstrate that the optical signatures of skyrmions can be utilised effectively in machine learning to predict important system parameters. Our method focuses specifically on the skyrmion-localised regions, reducing significantly the computational cost. By training convolutional neural networks on simulated polarised optical microscopy images of liquid crystal skyrmions, we showcase the ability of trained networks to accurately predict several selected parameters such as the free energy, cholesteric pitch, and strength of applied electric fields. This study highlights the importance of localized topologically arrested order parameter configurations for materials characterisation research empowered by state-of-the-art data science methods, and may pave the way for the development of advanced skyrmion-based applications.</description>

      <title>The single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of the Griffith criticality condition recently introduced by Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (Extreme Mechanics Letters 58: 101944, 2023), this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the single edge notch fracture test for viscoelastic elastomers. The results -- comprised of a combination of a parametric study and direct comparisons with experiments -- reveal how the non-Gaussian elasticity, the nonlinear viscosity, and the intrinsic fracture energy of elastomers interact and govern when fracture nucleates from the pre-existing crack in these tests. The results also serve to quantify the limitations of existing analyses, wherein viscous effects and the actual geometries of the pre-existing cracks and the specimens are neglected.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in active solids featuring alignment interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing emphasis on the study of active solids, the features of these classes of nonequilibrium systems and materials beyond their mere existence shift into focus. One concept of active solids addresses them as active, self-propelled units that are elastically linked to each other. The emergence of orientationally ordered, collectively moving states in such systems has been demonstrated. We here analyze the excitability of such collectively moving elastic states. To this end, we determine corresponding fluctuation spectra. They indicate that collectively excitable modes exist in the migrating solid. Differences arise when compared to those of corresponding passive solids. We provide evidence that the modes of excitation associated with the intrinsic fluctuations are related to corresponding modes of entropy production. Overall, we hope to stimulate by our investigation future experimental studies that focus on excitations in active solids.</description>

      <title>3D Optofluidic Control Using Reconfigurable Thermal Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidics has revolutionized control over small volumes through the use of physical barriers. However, the rigidity of these barriers limits flexibility in applications. We present an optofluidic toolbox that leverages structured light and photothermal conversion to create dynamic, reconfigurable fluidic boundaries. This system enables precise manipulation of fluids and particles by generating 3D thermal landscapes with high spatial control. Our approach replicates the functions of traditional barriers while additionally allowing real-time reconfiguration for complex tasks, such as individual particle steering and size-based sorting in heterogeneous mixtures. These results highlight the platform's potential for adaptive and multifunctional microfluidic systems in applications such as chemical synthesis, lab-on-chip devices, and microbiology, seamlessly integrating with existing setups due to its flexibility and minimal operation requirements.</description>

      <title>Active Inhomogeneous Mode-Coupling Theory (aIMCT) for Dense Systems of Self-Propelled Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy dynamics in a dense system of active particles with self-propulsion force $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ are crucial for many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that, unlike relaxation dynamics, dynamic heterogeneity (DH) in active glasses exhibits nontrivial behavior. However, the mechanism by which activity affects DH remains unknown. We have developed an active inhomogeneous mode-coupling theory (aIMCT) for DH in active glasses. We show that the nontrivial behavior of DH comes from a novel nonequilibrium effect of activity that leads to distinct behaviors of DH and relaxation dynamics in active glasses. When activity is small, DH exhibits equilibrium-like behavior with a power-law divergence of the peak height of the four-point correlation function, $\chi_C^\text{peak}$, and the aIMCT value of the exponent, $\mu\simeq 1.0$, is consistent with the existing and our new simulations of active glasses. However, $\chi_C^\text{peak}$ deviates from the scaling relations at higher $f_0$ values because of the novel effect on DH, although the deviation with varying $\tau_p$ is relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Role of obstacle softness in the diffusive behavior of active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the diffusive behavior of active Brownian particles in a two-dimensional confined channel filled with soft obstacles, whose softness is controlled by a parameter $K$. Here, active particles are subjected to external bias $F$. Particle diffusion is influenced by entropic barriers that arise due to variations in the shape of the chosen channel geometry. We observed that the interplay between obstacle softness, entropic barriers, and external bias leads to striking transport characteristics of the active particles. For instance, with increasing $F$, the non-linear mobility exhibits non-monotonic behavior, and effective diffusion is greatly enhanced, showing multiple peaks in the presence of soft obstacles. Further, as a function of $K$ and $F$, particles exhibit various diffusive behaviors, e.g., normal diffusion - where the role of obstacles is insignificant, subdiffusion or superdiffusion - where the particles are partially trapped by the obstacles, and particles are ultimately caged by the obstacles. These findings help understand the physical situations wherein active agents diffuse in crowded environments.</description>

      <title>Coarse grained modeling of a metal-organic framework/polymer composite and its gas adsorption at the nanoparticle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations have acted as a cornerstone to understand MOF/polymer interface structure, however, no molecular-level simulation has yet been performed at the nanoparticle scale. In this work, a hybrid MARTINI/Force Matching (FM) force field was developed and successfully implemented to model the ZIF-8/PVDF composite at a coarse grained resolution. Inter-phase interactions were modeled using FM potentials, which strive to reasonably reproduce the forces from an atomistic benchmark model, while intraphase interactions are modeled using the general-purpose MARTINI potentials. Systems made of a ZIF-8 nanoparticle embedded into a PVDF matrix were considered to evaluate the effect of nanoparticle size and morphology in the polymer structure and in the CO2 adsorption. Results show that simulations at the nanoparticle level are crucial for depicting the polymer penetration. Notably, the smallest nanoparticle exhibited the least extent of polymer penetration, while the cubic nanoparticle exhibited the highest amount. Polymer conformation and local density values change similarly in all ZIF-8/PVDF systems depending on whether the polymer lies inside or outside of the nanoparticle domain. All composite models present more significant CO2 adsorption in the nanoparticle domain than in the PVDF phase, in agreement with experiments. More remarkably, the small rhombic dodecahedron ZIF-8/PVDF system presents a larger equilibrium amount of gas adsorbed at ambient condition compared to the other two systems, in alignment with the observed polymer penetration trend. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 adsorbed at equilibrium is lower for the rhombic dodecahedron morphology than for the cubic one, contrary to the intuitive expectation founded in the polymer penetration trend. This result could be a reflection of a difference in the number of surface adsorption sites.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a buzz word since Google's AlphaGo beat a world champion in 2017. In the past five years, machine learning as a subset of the broader category of AI has obtained considerable attention in the research community of granular materials. This work offers a detailed review of the recent advances in machine learning-aided studies of granular materials from the particle-particle interaction at the grain level to the macroscopic simulations of granular flow. This work will start with the application of machine learning in the microscopic particle-particle interaction and associated contact models. Then, different neural networks for learning the constitutive behaviour of granular materials will be reviewed and compared. Finally, the macroscopic simulations of practical engineering or boundary value problems based on the combination of neural networks and numerical methods are discussed. We hope readers will have a clear idea of the development of machine learning-aided modelling of granular materials via this comprehensive review work.</description>

      <title>Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE) for Open Air Point-of-Care Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike biomarkers in biofluids, airborne biomarkers are dilute and difficult to trace. Detecting diverse airborne biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity typically relies on bulky and expensive equipment like mass spectrometers that remain inaccessible to the general population. Here, we introduce Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE), a simple, affordable, and portable platform that can detect both volatile, non-volatile, molecular, and particulate biomarkers in about 15 minutes. ABLE significantly improves gas detection limits by converting dilute gases into droplets by water condensation, producing concentrated aqueous samples that are easy to be tested. Fundamental studies of multiphase condensation revealed unexpected stability in condensate-trapped biomarkers, making ABLE a reliable, accessible, and high-performance system for open-air-based biosensing applications such as non-contact infant healthcare, pathogen detection in public space, and food safety.</description>

      <title>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in epithelial tissues with pulsating activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells not only have self-motility by crawling but are also capable of other types of active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, by using the Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. We find that random cell pulsation can fluidize solid epithelial tissues, resulting in hyperuniform fluids, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reversed solidification. We prove this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the birth of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation. We propose an unified fluctuating hydrodynamic theory to explain the two very different anomalous density fluctuations phenomena. Our findings can help understanding recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayers.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

      <title>Turbulent cascade arrests and the formation of intermediate-scale condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy cascades lie at the heart of the dynamics of turbulent flows. In a recent study of turbulence in fluids with odd-viscosity [de Wit \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{627}, 515 (2024)], the two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales leads to the arrest of the energy cascade and selection of an intermediate scale, between the forcing and the viscous scales. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we study a shell model that is carefully constructed to have three-dimensional turbulent dynamics at small wavenumbers and two-dimensional turbulent dynamics at large wavenumbers. The large scale separation that we can achieve in our shell model allows us to examine clearly the interplay between these dynamics, which leads to an arrest of the energy cascade at a transitional wavenumber and an associated accumulation of energy at the same scale. Such pile-up of energy around the transitional wavenumber is reminiscent of the formation of condensates in two-dimensional turbulence, \textit{but, in contrast, it occurs at intermediate wavenumbers instead of the smallest wavenumber</description>
