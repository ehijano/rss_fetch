      <title>Variational multirate integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of systems that act on multiple time scales is challenging. A stable integration of the fast dynamics requires a highly accurate approximation whereas for the simulation of the slow part, a coarser approximation is accurate enough. With regard to the general goals of any numerical method, high accuracy and low computational costs, a popular approach is to treat the slow and the fast part of a system differently. Embedding this approach in a variational framework is the keystone of this work. By paralleling continuous and discrete variational multirate dynamics, integrators are derived on a time grid consisting of macro and micro time nodes that are symplectic, momentum preserving and also exhibit good energy behaviour. The choice of the discrete approximations for the action determines the convergence order of the scheme as well as its implicit or explicit nature for the different parts of the multirate system. The convergence order is proven using the theory of variational error analysis. The performance of the multirate variational integrators is demonstrated by means of several examples.</description>

      <title>Recovery of rational functions via Hankel pencil method and sensitivities of the poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we develop a new method for the recovery of rational functions. Our idea is based on the property that Fourier coefficients of rational functions have the exponential structure and reconstruction of this exponential structure with the ESPRIT method in the frequency domain. Further we present sensitivity analysis for poles of rational functions reconstructed with our method in case of unstructured and structured perturbations. Finally, we consider several numerical experiments and, using sensitivities, explain the recovery errors for poles.</description>

      <title>MsFEM for advection-dominated problems in heterogeneous media: Stabilization via nonconforming variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of advection-diffusion equations with highly oscillatory coefficients and possibly dominant advection terms by means of the Multiscale Finite Element Method. The latter method is a now classical, finite element type method that performs a Galerkin approximation on a problem-dependent basis set, itself pre-computed in an offline stage. The approach is implemented here using basis functions that locally resolve both the diffusion and the advection terms. Variants with additional bubble functions and possibly weak inter-element continuity are proposed. Some theoretical arguments and a comprehensive set of numerical experiments allow to investigate and compare the stability and the accuracy of the approaches. The best approach constructed is shown to be adequate for both the diffusion- and advection-dominated regimes, and does not rely on an auxiliary stabilization parameter that would have to be properly adjusted.</description>

      <title>An extension of the low-rank Lyapunov ADI to non-zero initial values and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) method based on a commuting operator split and apply the results to the continuous time algebraic Lyapunov equation with low-rank constant term and approximate solution. Previously, it has been mandatory to start the low-rank ADI (LR-ADI) with an all-zero initial value. Our approach retains the known efficient iteration schemes of low-rank increments and residual to arbitrary low-rank initial values for the LR-ADI method. We further generalize some of the known properties of the LR-ADI for Lyapunov equations to larger classes of algorithms or problems.
  We investigate the performance of arbitrary initial values using two outer iterations in which LR-ADI is typically called. First, we solve an algebraic Riccati equation with the Newton method. Second, we solve a differential Riccati equation with a first-order Rosenbrock method. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed new initial value of the alternating-directions implicit (ADI) can lead to a significant reduction in the total number of ADI steps, while also showing a 17% and 8x speed-up over the zero initial value for the two equation types, respectively.</description>

      <title>On energy-dissipative finite element approximations for rate-type viscoelastic fluids with stress diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fully discrete finite element approximation of a model for unsteady flows of rate-type viscoelastic fluids with stress diffusion in two and three dimensions. The model consists of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation for the velocity, coupled with a diffusive variant of a combination of the Oldroyd-B and the Giesekus model for the left Cauchy--Green tensor. The discretization of the model is chosen such that an energy inequality is preserved at the fully discrete level. Thus, unconditional solvability and stability for the discrete system are guaranteed and the discrete Cauchy--Green tensor is positive definite. Moreover, subsequences of discrete solutions converge to a global-in-time weak solution, as the discretization parameters tend to zero. In the end, we present numerical convergence tests.</description>

      <title>Parametric finite element approximation of two-phase Navier--Stokes flow with viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a parametric finite element approximation of two-phase Navier-Stokes flow with viscoelasticity. The free boundary problem is given by the viscoelastic Navier-Stokes equations in the two fluid phases, connected by jump conditions across the interface. The elasticity in the fluids is characterised using the Oldroyd-B model with possible stress diffusion. The model was originally introduced to approximate fluid-structure interaction problems between an incompressible Newtonian fluid and a hyperelastic neo-Hookean solid, which are possible limit cases of the model. We approximate a variational formulation of the model with an unfitted finite element method that uses piecewise linear parametric finite elements. The two-phase Navier-Stokes-Oldroyd-B system in the bulk regions is discretised in a way that guarantees unconditional solvability and stability for the coupled bulk-interface system. Good volume conservation properties for the two phases are observed in the case where the pressure approximation space is enriched with the help of an XFEM function. We show the applicability of our method with some numerical results.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Neural Network-POD for Acoustic and Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Parametric Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reduced-order models for acoustic and electromagnetic wave problems in parametrically defined domains. The parameter-to-solution maps are approximated following the so-called Galerkin POD-NN method, which combines the construction of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with neural networks (NNs). As opposed to the standard reduced basis method, this approach allows for the swift and efficient evaluation of reduced-order solutions for any given parametric input.
  As is customary in the analysis of problems in random or parametrically defined domains, we start by transporting the formulation to a reference domain. This yields a parameter-dependent variational problem set on parameter-independent functional spaces. In particular, we consider affine-parametric domain transformations characterized by a high-dimensional, possibly countably infinite, parametric input. To keep the number of evaluations of the high-fidelity solutions manageable, we propose using low-discrepancy sequences to sample the parameter space efficiently. Then, we train an NN to learn the coefficients in the reduced representation. This approach completely decouples the offline and online stages of the reduced basis paradigm.
  Numerical results for the three-dimensional Helmholtz and Maxwell equations confirm the method's accuracy up to a certain barrier and show significant gains in online speed-up compared to the traditional Galerkin POD method.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Monte Carlo methods for three-dimensional diffusive capture problems in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

      <title>Exponential time differencing for matrix-valued dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix evolution equations occur in many applications, such as dynamical Lyapunov/Sylvester systems or Riccati equations in optimization and stochastic control, machine learning or data assimilation. In many cases, their tightest stability condition is coming from a linear term. Exponential time differencing (ETD) is known to produce highly stable numerical schemes by treating the linear term in an exact fashion. In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are a method of choice. We propose an extension of the class of ETD algorithms to matrix-valued dynamical equations. This allows us to produce highly efficient and stable integration schemes. We show their efficiency and applicability for a variety of real-world problems, from geophysical applications to dynamical problems in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Least SQuares Discretizations (LSQD): a robust and versatile meshless paradigm for solving elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for numerical methods that combine facility and efficiency, while remaining accurate and versatile, is critical. Often, irregular geometries challenge traditional methods that rely on structured or body-fitted meshes. Meshless methods mitigate these issues but oftentimes require the weak formulation which involves defining quadrature rules over potentially intricate geometries. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Least Squares Discretization (LSQD) method. This novel approach simplifies the application of meshless methods by eliminating the need for a weak formulation and necessitates minimal numerical analysis. It offers significant advantages in terms of ease of implementation and adaptability to complex geometries. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of the LSQD method in solving elliptic partial differential equations for a variety of boundary conditions, geometries, and data layouts. We monitor h-P convergence across these parameters and construct an a posteriori built-in error estimator to establish our method as a robust and accessible numerical alternative.</description>

      <title>Dissipativeness of the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments for kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a dissipativeness analysis of a quadrature method of moments (called HyQMOM) for the one-dimensional BGK equation. The method has exhibited its good performance in numerous applications. However, its mathematical foundation has not been clarified. Here we present an analytical proof of the strict hyperbolicity of the HyQMOM-induced moment closure systems by introducing a polynomial-based closure technique. As a byproduct, a class of numerical schemes for the HyQMOM system is shown to be realizability preserving under CFL-type conditions. We also show that the system preserves the dissipative properties of the kinetic equation by verifying a certain structural stability condition. The proof uses a newly introduced affine invariance and the homogeneity of the HyQMOM and heavily relies on the theory of orthogonal polynomials associated with realizable moments, in particular, the moments of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin method for a three-dimensional coupled fluid-poroelastic model with applications to brain fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of the interaction between a poroelastic medium and a fluid in a hollow cavity is crucial for understanding, e.g., the multiphysics flow of blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in the brain, the supply of blood by the coronary arteries in heart perfusion, or the interaction between groundwater and rivers or lakes. In particular, the cerebral tissue's elasticity and its perfusion by blood and interstitial CSF can be described by Multi-compartment Poroelasticity (MPE), while CSF flow in the brain ventricles can be modeled by the (Navier-)Stokes equations, the overall system resulting in a coupled MPE-(Navier-)Stokes system. The aim of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to extend and verify in a three-dimensional setting a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids recently presented for the MPE-Stokes problem. Second, we carry out the analysis of the method based on an extension of the proposed formulation so that physics-based Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions are taken into account at the interface: these conditions are essential to model the friction between the fluid and the porous medium. Finally, by a comparative numerical investigation, we assess the fluid-dynamics effects of these boundary conditions and of employing either Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations to model the CSF flow. The semidiscrete numerical scheme for the coupled problem is proved to be stable and optimally convergent. Temporal discretization is obtained using Newmark's $\beta$-method for the elastic wave equation and the $\theta$-method for the remaining equations of the model. The theoretical error estimates are verified by numerical simulations on a test case with a manufactured solution, and a numerical investigation is carried out on a three-dimensional geometry to assess the effects of interface conditions and fluid inertia on the system.</description>

      <title>On one-step numerical schemes of weak convergence for SDEs with super-linear coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weak convergence of one-step schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with one-sided Lipschitz conditions. It is known that the super-linear coefficients may lead to a blowup of moments of solutions and their numerical solutions. When solutions to SDEs have all finite moments, weak convergence of numerical schemes has been investigated in [Wang et al (2023), Weak error analysis for strong approximation schemes of SDEs with super-linear coefficients, IMA Journal numerical analysis]. Some modified Euler schemes have been analyzed for weak convergence. In this work, we present a family of explicit schemes of first and second-order weak convergence based on classical schemes for SDEs. We explore the effects of limited moments on these schemes. We provide a systematic but simple way to establish weak convergence orders for schemes based on approximations/modifications of drift and diffusion coefficients. We present several numerical examples of these schemes and show their weak convergence orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new hydrostatic reconstruction procedure to construct well-balanced schemes for one and multilayer shallow water flows, including wetting and drying. Initially, we derive the method for a path-conservative finite volume scheme and combine it with entropy conservative fluxes and suitable numerical dissipation to preserve an entropy inequality in the semi-discrete case. We then combine the novel hydrostatic reconstruction with a collocated nodal split-form discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, extending the method to high-order and curvilinear meshes. The high-order method incorporates an additional positivity-limiter and is blended with a compatible subcell finite volume method to maintain well-balancedness at wet/dry fronts. We prove entropy stability, well-balancedness, and positivity-preservation for both methods. Numerical results for the high-order method validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Using the Transport of Intensity and the Transport of Phase Equation for Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of intensity equation (TIE) and the transport of phase equation (TPE) for solving the phase retrieval problem. Both the TIE and the TPE are derived from the paraxial Helmholtz equation and relate phase information to the intensity. The TIE is usually favored since the TPE is nonlinear. The main contribution of this paper is that we discuss situations in which it is possible to use the two equations in a hybrid manner: We show that 2-dimensional phase information retrieved by the TIE can be used as initial data for the TPE, enabling the acquisition of 3-dimensional phase information. The latter is solved using the method of characteristic and viscosity methods. Both the TIE and the viscosity method are numerically implemented with finite element methods.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Preserving and Energy Stable Scheme for the Euler System with Congestion Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design and analyze an asymptotic preserving (AP), semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the scaled compressible isentropic Euler system with a singular pressure law known as the congestion pressure law. The congestion pressure law imposes a maximal density constraint of the form $0\leq \varrho &lt;1$, and the scaling introduces a small parameter $\varepsilon$ in order to control the stiffness of the density constraint. As $\varepsilon\to 0$, the solutions of the compressible system converge to solutions of the so-called free-congested Euler equations that couples compressible and incompressible dynamics. We show that the proposed scheme is positivity preserving and energy stable. In addition, we also show that the numerical densities satisfy a discrete variant of the constraint. By means of extensive numerical case studies, we verify the efficacy of the scheme and show that the scheme is able to capture the two dynamics in the limiting regime, thereby proving the AP property.</description>

      <title>Maximum principle preserving time implicit DGSEM for nonlinear scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns the analysis of the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) with implicit time stepping for the numerical approximation of nonlinear scalar conservation laws in multiple space dimensions. We consider either the DGSEM with a backward Euler time stepping, or a space-time DGSEM discretization to remove the restriction on the time step. We design graph viscosities in space, and in time for the space-time DGSEM, to make the schemes maximum principle preserving and entropy stable for every admissible convex entropy. We also establish well-posedness of the discrete problems by showing existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the nonlinear implicit algebraic relations that need to be solved at each time step. Numerical experiments in one space dimension are presented to illustrate the properties of these schemes.</description>

      <title>Constrained $L^p$ Approximation of Shape Tensors and its Role for the Determination of Shape Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our earlier work [arXiv:2309.13595] on the $L^p$ approximation of the shape tensor by Laurain and Sturm. In particular, it is shown that the weighted $L^p$ distance to an affine space of admissible symmetric shape tensors satisfying a divergence constraint provides the shape gradient with respect to the $L^{p^\ast}$-norm (where $1/p + 1/p^\ast = 1$) of the elastic strain associated with the shape deformation. This approach allows the combination of two ingredients which have already been used successfully in numerical shape optimization: (i) departing from the Hilbert space framework towards the Lipschitz topology approximated by $W^{1,p^\ast}$ with $p^\ast &gt; 2$ and (ii) using the symmetric rather than the full gradient to define the norm. Similarly to [arXiv:2309.13595], the $L^p$ distance measures the shape stationarity by means of the dual norm of the shape derivative with respect to the above-mentioned $L^{p^\ast}$-norm of the elastic strain. Moreover, the Lagrange multiplier for the momentum balance constraint constitute the steepest descent deformation with respect to this norm. The finite element realization of this approach is done using the weakly symmetric PEERS element and its three-dimensional counterpart, respectively. The resulting piecewise constant approximation for the Lagrange multiplier is reconstructed to a shape gradient in $W^{1,p^\ast}$ and used in an iterative procedure towards the optimal shape.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Learning under a Multi-fidelity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by multi-fidelity methods in computer simulations, this article introduces procedures to design surrogates for the input/output relationship of a high-fidelity code. These surrogates should be learned from runs of both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity codes and be accompanied by error guarantees that are deterministic rather than stochastic. For this purpose, the article advocates a framework tied to a theory focusing on worst-case guarantees, namely Optimal Recovery. The multi-fidelity considerations triggered new theoretical results in three scenarios: the globally optimal estimation of linear functionals, the globally optimal approximation of arbitrary quantities of interest in Hilbert spaces, and their locally optimal approximation, still within Hilbert spaces. The latter scenario boils down to the determination of the Chebyshev center for the intersection of two hyperellipsoids. It is worth noting that the mathematical framework presented here, together with its possible extension, seems to be relevant in several other contexts briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized upwind summation-by-parts operators and their application to nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a pressing demand for robust, high-order baseline schemes for conservation laws that minimize reliance on supplementary stabilization. In this work, we respond to this demand by developing new baseline schemes within a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework, utilizing upwind summation-by-parts (USBP) operators and flux vector splittings. To this end, we demonstrate the existence of USBP operators on arbitrary grid points and provide a straightforward procedure for their construction. Our method encompasses a broader class of USBP operators, not limited to equidistant grid points. This approach facilitates the development of novel USBP operators on Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto (LGL) points, which are suited for nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. The resulting DG-USBP operators combine the strengths of traditional summation-by-parts (SBP) schemes with the benefits of upwind discretizations, including inherent dissipation mechanisms. Through numerical experiments, ranging from one-dimensional convergence tests to multi-dimensional curvilinear and under-resolved flow simulations, we find that DG-USBP operators, when integrated with flux vector splitting methods, foster more robust baseline schemes without excessive artificial dissipation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the method of mappings for performing shape optimization for unsteady fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. In this work, we focus on the numerical implementation. We model the optimization problem such that it takes several theoretical results into account, such as regularity requirements on the transformations and a differential geometrical point of view on the manifold of shapes. Moreover, we discretize the problem such that we can compute exact discrete gradients. This allows for the use of general purpose optimization solvers. We focus on an FSI benchmark problem to validate our numerical implementation. The method is used to optimize parts of the outer boundary and the interface. The numerical simulations build on FEniCS, dolfin-adjoint and IPOPT. Moreover, as an additional theoretical result, we show that for a linear special case the adjoint attains the same structure as the forward problem but reverses the temporal flow of information.</description>

      <title>Optimal deep learning of holomorphic operators between Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning problems arise in many key areas of scientific computing where Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are used to model physical systems. In such scenarios, the operators map between Banach or Hilbert spaces. In this work, we tackle the problem of learning operators between Banach spaces, in contrast to the vast majority of past works considering only Hilbert spaces. We focus on learning holomorphic operators - an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures - specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth - under standard $\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms. Finally, we present numerical results demonstrating the practical performance on challenging problems including the parametric diffusion, Navier-Stokes-Brinkman and Boussinesq PDEs.</description>

      <title>Optimization over bounded-rank matrices through a desingularization enables joint global and local guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence guarantees for optimization over bounded-rank matrices are delicate to obtain because the feasible set is a non-smooth and non-convex algebraic variety. Existing techniques include projected gradient descent, fixed-rank optimization (over the maximal-rank stratum), and the LR parameterization. They all lack either global guarantees (the ability to accumulate only at critical points) or fast local convergence (e.g., if the limit has non-maximal rank). We seek optimization algorithms that enjoy both.
  Khrulkov and Oseledets [2018] parameterize the bounded-rank variety via a desingularization to recast the optimization problem onto a smooth manifold. Building on their ideas, we develop a Riemannian geometry for this desingularization, also with care for numerical considerations. We use it to secure global convergence to critical points with fast local rates, for a large range of algorithms. On matrix completion tasks, we find that this approach is comparable to others, while enjoying better general-purpose theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Stiefel manifold: tractable metrics, second-order geometry and Newton's methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization under the symplecticity constraint is an approach for solving various problems in quantum physics and scientific computing. Building on the results that this optimization problem can be transformed into an unconstrained problem on the symplectic Stiefel manifold, we construct geometric ingredients for Riemannian optimization with a new family of Riemannian metrics called tractable metrics and develop Riemannian Newton schemes. The newly obtained ingredients do not only generalize several existing results but also provide us with freedom to choose a suitable metric for each problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first try to develop the explicit second-order geometry and Newton's methods on the symplectic Stiefel manifold. For the Riemannian Newton method, we first consider novel operator-valued formulas for computing the Riemannian Hessian of a~cost function, which further allows the manifold to be endowed with a weighted Euclidean metric that can provide a preconditioning effect. We then solve the resulting Newton equation, as the central step of Newton's methods, directly via transforming it into a~saddle point problem followed by vectorization, or iteratively via applying any matrix-free iterative method either to the operator Newton equation or its saddle point formulation. Finally, we propose a hybrid Riemannian Newton optimization algorithm that enjoys both global convergence and quadratic/superlinear local convergence at the final stage. Various numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Learning rate adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimization methods: numerical simulations for deep learning methods for partial differential equations and convergence analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method, as well as accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods such as the Adam optimizer fail to converge if the learning rates do not converge to zero (as, for example, in the situation of constant learning rates). Numerical simulations often use human-tuned deterministic learning rate schedules or small constant learning rates. The default learning rate schedules for SGD optimization methods in machine learning implementation frameworks such as TensorFlow and Pytorch are constant learning rates. In this work we propose and study a learning-rate-adaptive approach for SGD optimization methods in which the learning rate is adjusted based on empirical estimates for the values of the objective function of the considered optimization problem (the function that one intends to minimize). In particular, we propose a learning-rate-adaptive variant of the Adam optimizer and implement it in case of several neural network learning problems, particularly, in the context of deep learning approximation methods for partial differential equations such as deep Kolmogorov methods, physics-informed neural networks, and deep Ritz methods. In each of the presented learning problems the proposed learning-rate-adaptive variant of the Adam optimizer faster reduces the value of the objective function than the Adam optimizer with the default learning rate. For a simple class of quadratic minimization problems we also rigorously prove that a learning-rate-adaptive variant of the SGD optimization method converges to the minimizer of the considered minimization problem. Our convergence proof is based on an analysis of the laws of invariant measures of the SGD method as well as on a more general convergence analysis for SGD with random but predictable learning rates which we develop in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) marks a significant shift from traditional multi-layer perceptrons in deep learning. Initially, KANs employed B-spline curves as their primary basis function, but their inherent complexity posed implementation challenges. Consequently, researchers have explored alternative basis functions such as Wavelets, Polynomials, and Fractional functions. In this research, we explore the use of rational functions as a novel basis function for KANs. We propose two different approaches based on Pade approximation and rational Jacobi functions as trainable basis functions, establishing the rational KAN (rKAN). We then evaluate rKAN's performance in various deep learning and physics-informed tasks to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness in function approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the minimization of the pseudospectral abscissa of a matrix-valued function dependent on parameters analytically. The problem is motivated by robust stability and transient behavior considerations for a linear control system that has optimization parameters. We describe a subspace procedure to cope with the setting when the matrix-valued function is of large size. The proposed subspace procedure solves a sequence of reduced problems obtained by restricting the matrix-valued function to small subspaces, whose dimensions increase gradually. It possesses desirable features such as a superlinear convergence exhibited by the decay in the errors of the minimizers of the reduced problems. In mathematical terms, the problem we consider is a large-scale nonconvex minimax eigenvalue optimization problem such that the eigenvalue function appears in the constraint of the inner maximization problem. Devising and analyzing a subspace framework for the minimax eigenvalue optimization problem at hand with the eigenvalue function in the constraint require special treatment that makes use of a Lagrangian and dual variables. There are notable advantages in minimizing the pseudospectral abscissa over maximizing the distance to instability or minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm; the optimized pseudospectral abscissa provides quantitative information about the worst-case transient growth, and the initial guesses for the parameter values to optimize the pseudospectral abscissa can be arbitrary, unlike the case to optimize the distance to instability and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm that would normally require initial guesses yielding asymptotically stable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a standard algorithm in seismic imaging. Its implementation requires the a priori choice of a number of "design parameters", such as the positions of sensors for the actual measurements and one (or more) regularisation weights. In this paper we describe a novel algorithm for determining these design parameters automatically from a set of training images, using a (supervised) bilevel learning approach. In our algorithm, the upper level objective function measures the quality of the reconstructions of the training images, where the reconstructions are obtained by solving the lower level optimisation problem -- in this case FWI. Our algorithm employs (variants of) the BFGS quasi-Newton method to perform the optimisation at each level, and thus requires the repeated solution of the forward problem -- here taken to be the Helmholtz equation.
  This paper focuses on the implementation of the algorithm. The novel contributions are: (i) an adjoint-state method for the efficient computation of the upper-level gradient; (ii) a complexity analysis for the bilevel algorithm, which counts the number of Helmholtz solves needed and shows this number is independent of the number of design parameters optimised; (iii) an effective preconditioning strategy for iteratively solving the linear systems required at each step of the bilevel algorithm; (iv) a smoothed extraction process for point values of the discretised wavefield, necessary for ensuring a smooth upper level objective function. The algorithm also uses an extension to the bilevel setting of classical frequency-continuation strategies, helping avoid convergence to spurious stationary points. The advantage of our algorithm is demonstrated on a problem derived from the standard Marmousi test problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polynomial homotopy is a family of polynomial systems, typically in one parameter $t$. Our problem is to compute power series expansions of the coordinates of the solutions in the parameter $t$, accurately, using multiple double arithmetic. One application of this problem is the location of the nearest singular solution in a polynomial homotopy, via the theorem of Fabry. Power series serve as input to construct Pad\'{e} approximations.
  Exploiting the massive parallelism of Graphics Processing Units capable of performing several trillions floating-point operations per second, the objective is to compensate for the cost overhead caused by arithmetic with power series in multiple double precision. The application of Newton's method for this problem requires the evaluation and differentiation of polynomials, followed by solving a blocked lower triangular linear system. Experimental results are obtained on NVIDIA GPUs, in particular the RTX 2080, RTX 4080, P100, V100, and A100.
  Code generated by the CAMPARY software is used to obtain results in double double, quad double, and octo double precision. The programs in this study are self contained, available in a public github repository under the GPL-v3.0 License.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Generalized Finite Differences for Variable Coefficient Diffusion Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach of discretizing variable coefficient diffusion operators in the context of meshfree generalized finite difference methods. Our ansatz uses properties of derived operators and combines the discrete Laplace operator with reconstruction functions approximating the diffusion coefficient. Provided that the reconstructions are of a sufficiently high order, we prove that the order of accuracy of the discrete Laplace operator transfers to the derived diffusion operator. We show that the new discrete diffusion operator inherits the diagonal dominance property of the discrete Laplace operator. Finally, we present the possibility of discretizing anisotropic diffusion operators with the help of derived operators. Our numerical results for Poisson's equation and the heat equation show that even low-order reconstructions preserve the order of the underlying discrete Laplace operator for sufficiently smooth diffusion coefficients. In experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of the new discrete diffusion operator to interface problems with point clouds not aligning to the interface and numerically show first-order convergence.</description>

      <title>Multilevel domain decomposition-based architectures for physics-informed neural networks</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a powerful approach for solving problems involving differential equations, yet they often struggle to solve problems with high frequency and/or multi-scale solutions. Finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) improve the performance of PINNs in this regime by combining them with an overlapping domain decomposition approach. In this work, FBPINNs are extended by adding multiple levels of domain decompositions to their solution ansatz, inspired by classical multilevel Schwarz domain decomposition methods (DDMs). Analogous to typical tests for classical DDMs, we assess how the accuracy of PINNs, FBPINNs and multilevel FBPINNs scale with respect to computational effort and solution complexity by carrying out strong and weak scaling tests. Our numerical results show that the proposed multilevel FBPINNs consistently and significantly outperform PINNs across a range of problems with high frequency and multi-scale solutions. Furthermore, as expected in classical DDMs, we show that multilevel FBPINNs improve the accuracy of FBPINNs when using large numbers of subdomains by aiding global communication between subdomains.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of swarming dynamics with topological interaction and transient leaders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a model describing the collective motion of birds. The model introduces spontaneous changes in direction which are initialized by few agents, here referred as leaders, whose influence act on their nearest neighbors, in the following referred as followers. Starting at the microscopic level, we develop a kinetic model that characterizes the behaviour of large flocks with transient leadership. One significant challenge lies in managing topological interactions, as identifying nearest neighbors in extensive systems can be computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic particle method to simulate the mesoscopic dynamics and reduce the computational cost of identifying closer agents from quadratic to logarithmic complexity using a $k$-nearest neighbours search algorithm with a binary tree. Lastly, we conduct various numerical experiments for different scenarios to validate the algorithm's effectiveness and investigate collective dynamics in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a higher-order surface finite element (SFEM) penalty-based discretization of the tangential surface Stokes problem. Several discrete formulations are investigated which are equivalent in the continuous setting. The impact of the choice of discretization of the diffusion term and of the divergence term on numerical accuracy and convergence, as well as on implementation advantages, is discussed. We analyze the inf-sup stability of the discrete scheme in a generic approach by lifting stable finite element pairs known from the literature. A discretization error analysis in tangential norms then shows optimal order convergence of an isogeometric setting that requires only geometric knowledge of the discrete surface.</description>

      <title>A second-order in time, BGN-based parametric finite element method for geometric flows of curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the field of geometric curve evolutions has attracted significant attention from scientific computing. One of the most popular numerical methods for solving geometric flows is the so-called BGN scheme, which was proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg (J. Comput. Phys., 222 (2007), pp.~441--467), due to its favorable properties (e.g., its computational efficiency and the good mesh property). However, the BGN scheme is limited to first-order accuracy in time, and how to develop a higher-order numerical scheme is challenging. In this paper, we propose a fully discrete, temporal second-order parametric finite element method, which integrates with two different mesh regularization techniques, for solving geometric flows of curves. The scheme is constructed based on the BGN formulation and a semi-implicit Crank-Nicolson leap-frog time stepping discretization as well as a linear finite element approximation in space. More importantly, we point out that the shape metrics, such as manifold distance and Hausdorff distance, instead of function norms, should be employed to measure numerical errors. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BGN-based scheme is second-order accurate in time in terms of shape metrics. Moreover, by employing the classical BGN scheme as mesh regularization techniques, our proposed second-order schemes exhibit good properties with respect to the mesh distribution. In addition, an unconditional interlaced energy stability property is obtained for one of the mesh regularization techniques.</description>

      <title>Extrapolated regularization of nearly singular integrals on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for computing nearly singular integrals that occur when single or double layer surface integrals, for harmonic potentials or Stokes flow, are evaluated at points nearby. Such values could be needed in solving an integral equation when one surface is close to another or to obtain values at grid points. We replace the singular kernel with a regularized version having a length parameter $\delta$ in order to control discretization error. Analysis near the singularity leads to an expression for the error due to regularization which has terms with unknown coefficients multiplying known quantities. By computing the integral with three choices of $\delta$ we can solve for an extrapolated value that has regularization error reduced to $O(\delta^5)$, uniformly for target points on or near the surface. In examples with $\delta/h$ constant and moderate resolution we observe total error about $O(h^5)$ close to the surface. For convergence as $h \to 0$ we can choose $\delta$ proportional to $h^q$ with $q &lt; 1$ to ensure the discretization error is dominated by the regularization error. With $q = 4/5$ we find errors about $O(h^4)$. For harmonic potentials we extend the approach to a version with $O(\delta^7)$ regularization; it typically has smaller errors but the order of accuracy is less predictable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system by a family of discontinuous Galerkin space-time finite element methods. The model is rewritten as a first-order evolutionary problem that is treated by the unified abstract solution theory of R. Picard. For the discretization in space, generalizations of the distribution gradient and divergence operators on broken polynomial spaces are defined. Since their skew-selfadjointness is perturbed by boundary surface integrals, adjustments are introduced such that the skew-selfadjointness of the first-order differential operator in space is recovered. Well-posedness of the fully discrete problem and error estimates for the discontinuous Galerkin approximation in space and time are proved.</description>

Abstract: We propose a third-order numerical integrator based on the Neumann series and the Filon quadrature, designed mainly for highly oscillatory partial differential equations. The method can be applied to equations that exhibit small or moderate oscillations; however, counter-intuitively, large oscillations increase the accuracy of the scheme. With the proposed approach, the convergence order of the method can be easily improved. Error analysis of the method is also performed. We consider linear evolution equations involving first- and second-time derivatives that feature elliptic differential operators, such as the heat equation or the wave equation. Numerical experiments consider the case in which the space dimension is greater than one and confirm the theoretical study.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Two-Level Domain Decomposition Eigensolver for Periodic Schr\"odinger Eigenstates in Anisotropically Expanding Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerating iterative eigenvalue algorithms is often achieved by employing a spectral shifting strategy. Unfortunately, improved shifting typically leads to a smaller eigenvalue for the resulting shifted operator, which in turn results in a high condition number of the underlying solution matrix, posing a major challenge for iterative linear solvers. This paper introduces a two-level domain decomposition preconditioner that addresses this issue for the linear Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem, even in the presence of a vanishing eigenvalue gap in non-uniform, expanding domains. Since the quasi-optimal shift, which is already available as the solution to a spectral cell problem, is required for the eigenvalue solver, it is logical to also use its associated eigenfunction as a generator to construct a coarse space. We analyze the resulting two-level additive Schwarz preconditioner and obtain a condition number bound that is independent of the domain's anisotropy, despite the need for only one basis function per subdomain for the coarse solver. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its flexibility and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Efficient algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the curse of dimensionality. We extend the forward-backward stochastic neural networks (FBSNNs) which depends on forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) to solve incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. For Cahn-Hilliard equation, we derive a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation from a widely used stabilized scheme for original Cahn-Hilliard equation. This equation can be written as a continuous parabolic system, where FBSDE can be applied and the unknown solution is approximated by neural network. Also our method is successfully developed to Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equation. The accuracy and stability of our methods are shown in many numerical experiments, specially in high dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the numerical approximations of random periodic solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Under non-globally Lipschitz conditions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of random periodic solutions for the considered equations and its numerical approximations generated by the stochastic theta (ST) methods with theta within (1/2,1]. It is shown that the random periodic solution of each ST method converges strongly in the mean square sense to that of SDEs for all step size. More precisely, the mean square convergence order is 1/2 for SDEs with multiplicative noise and 1 for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical results are finally reported to confirm these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Neural Operator for various domains and parameters of partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scientific and engineering applications, solving partial differential equations (PDEs) across various parameters and domains normally relies on resource-intensive numerical methods. Neural operators based on deep learning offered a promising alternative to PDEs solving by directly learning physical laws from data. However, the current neural operator methods were limited to solve PDEs on fixed domains. Expanding neural operators to solve PDEs on various domains hold significant promise in medical imaging, engineering design and manufacturing applications, where geometric and parameter changes are essential. This paper presents a novel neural operator learning framework for solving PDEs with various domains and parameters defined for physical systems, named diffeomorphism neural operator (DNO). The main idea is that a neural operator learns in a generic domain which is diffeomorphically mapped from various physics domains expressed by the same PDE. In this way, the challenge of operator learning on various domains is transformed into operator learning on the generic domain. The generalization performance of DNO on different domains can be assessed by a proposed method which evaluates the geometric similarity between a new domain and the domains of training dataset after diffeomorphism. Experiments on Darcy flow, pipe flow, airfoil flow and mechanics were carried out, where harmonic and volume parameterization were used as the diffeomorphism for 2D and 3D domains. The DNO framework demonstrated robust learning capabilities and strong generalization performance across various domains and parameters.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a fast wavefield evaluation method for two-dimensional wave scattering problems. The proposed method is based on a modified version of proxy-surface-accelerated interpolative decomposition, making it effective even if the evaluation points are near the boundary. The commonly known fast multipole method requires the use of direct evaluations near the boundaries of scatterers because the analytical expansion of kernel functions does not converge. On the one hand, the proposed method does not require the analytical expansion of kernel functions. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Multi-continuum Model for Multiscale Flow Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale problems can usually be approximated through numerical homogenization by an equation with some effective parameters that can capture the macroscopic behavior of the original system on the coarse grid to speed up the simulation. However, this approach usually assumes scale separation and that the heterogeneity of the solution can be approximated by the solution average in each coarse block. For complex multiscale problems, the computed single effective properties/continuum might be inadequate. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based multi-continuum model to enrich the homogenized equation and improve the accuracy of the single continuum model for multiscale problems with some given data. Without loss of generalization, we consider a two-continuum case. The first flow equation keeps the information of the original homogenized equation with an additional interaction term. The second continuum is newly introduced, and the effective permeability in the second flow equation is determined by a neural network. The interaction term between the two continua aligns with that used in the Dual-porosity model but with a learnable coefficient determined by another neural network. The new model with neural network terms is then optimized using trusted data. We discuss both direct back-propagation and the adjoint method for the PDE-constraint optimization problem. Our proposed learning-based multi-continuum model can resolve multiple interacted media within each coarse grid block and describe the mass transfer among them, and it has been demonstrated to significantly improve the simulation results through numerical experiments involving both linear and nonlinear flow equations.</description>

      <title>The Loewner framework for parametric systems: Taming the curse of dimensionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach designed for approximating linear and nonlinear systems. The goal here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. One main innovation established here is the construction of data-based realizations for any number of parameters. Equally importantly, we show how to alleviate the computational burden, by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. This reduces the complexity from $O(N^3)$ to about $O(N^{1.4})$, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is defined. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a coupled set of Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices then allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric transfer function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic computational burden reduction. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global information about dynamical systems can be extracted by analysing associated infinite-dimensional transfer operators, such as Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators as well as their infinitesimal generators. In practice, these operators typically need to be approximated from data. Popular approximation methods are extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and generator extended mode decomposition (gEDMD). We propose a unified framework that leverages Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the operator of interest on a finite-dimensional space spanned by a set of basis functions. Our framework contains EDMD and gEDMD as special cases, but can also be used to approximate more general operators. Our key contributions are proofs of the convergence of the approximating operator and its spectrum under non-restrictive conditions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates and account for the presence of noise in the observations. Whilst all these results are broadly applicable, they also refine previous analyses of EDMD and gEDMD. We verify the analytical results with the aid of several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of [49], but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Mechanics of Knitted Fabrics Through Hierarchical Geometric Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knitting interloops one-dimensional yarns into three-dimensional fabrics that exhibit behaviours beyond their constitutive materials. How extensibility and anisotropy emerge from the hierarchical organisation of yarns into knitted fabrics has long been unresolved. We sought to unravel the mechanical roles of tensile mechanics, assembly and dynamics arising from the yarn level on fabric nonlinearity by developing a yarn-based dynamical model. This physically validated model captures the fundamental mechanical response of knitted fabrics, analogous to flexible metamaterials and biological fiber networks due to geometric nonlinearity within such hierarchical systems. Fabric anisotropy originates from observed yarn-yarn rearrangements during alignment dynamics and is topology-dependent. This yarn-based model also provides a design space of knitted fabrics to embed functionalities by varying geometric configuration and material property in instructed procedures compatible to machine manufacturing. Our hierarchical approach to build up a knitted fabrics computationally modernizes an ancient craft and represents a first step towards mechanical programmability of knitted fabrics in wide engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Dense outputs from quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum dense output problem is the process of evaluating time-accumulated observables from time-dependent quantum dynamics using quantum computers. This problem arises frequently in applications such as quantum control and spectroscopic computation. We present a range of algorithms designed to operate on both early and fully fault-tolerant quantum platforms. These methodologies draw upon techniques like amplitude estimation, Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers, and quantum Carleman linearization. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis with respect to the evolution time $T$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$. Our results demonstrate that the linearization approach can nearly achieve optimal complexity $\mathcal{O}(T/\epsilon)$ for a certain type of low-rank dense outputs. Moreover, we provide a linearization of the dense output problem that yields an exact and finite-dimensional closure which encompasses the original states. This formulation is related to the Koopman Invariant Subspace theory and may be of independent interest in nonlinear control and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>High order universal portfolios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cover universal portfolio (UP from now on) has many interesting theoretical and numerical properties and was investigated for a long time. Building on it, we explore what happens when we add this UP to the market as a new synthetic asset and construct by recurrence higher order UPs. We investigate some important theoretical properties of the high order UPs and show in particular that they are indeed different from the Cover UP and are capable to break the time permutation invariance. We show that under some perturbation regime the second high order UP has better Sharp ratio than the standard UP and briefly investigate arbitrage opportunities thus created. Numerical experiences on a benchmark from the literature confirm that high order UPs improve Cover's UP performances.</description>

      <title>DynGMA: a robust approach for learning stochastic differential equations from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning unknown stochastic differential equations (SDEs) from observed data is a significant and challenging task with applications in various fields. Current approaches often use neural networks to represent drift and diffusion functions, and construct likelihood-based loss by approximating the transition density to train these networks. However, these methods often rely on one-step stochastic numerical schemes, necessitating data with sufficiently high time resolution. In this paper, we introduce novel approximations to the transition density of the parameterized SDE: a Gaussian density approximation inspired by the random perturbation theory of dynamical systems, and its extension, the dynamical Gaussian mixture approximation (DynGMA). Benefiting from the robust density approximation, our method exhibits superior accuracy compared to baseline methods in learning the fully unknown drift and diffusion functions and computing the invariant distribution from trajectory data. And it is capable of handling trajectory data with low time resolution and variable, even uncontrollable, time step sizes, such as data generated from Gillespie's stochastic simulations. We then conduct several experiments across various scenarios to verify the advantages and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Rational Parametric Curves via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point containment queries for regions bound by watertight geometric surfaces, i.e., closed and without self-intersections, can be evaluated straightforwardly with a number of well-studied algorithms. When this assumption on domain geometry is not met, such methods are either unusable, or prone to misclassifications that can lead to cascading errors in downstream applications. More robust point classification schemes based on generalized winding numbers have been proposed, as they are indifferent to these imperfections. However, existing algorithms are limited to point clouds and collections of linear elements. We extend this methodology to encompass more general curved shapes with an algorithm that evaluates the winding number scalar field over unstructured collections of rational parametric curves. In particular, we evaluate the winding number for each curve independently, making the derived containment query robust to how the curves are arranged. We ensure geometric fidelity in our queries by treating each curve as equivalent to an adaptively constructed polyline that provably has the same generalized winding number at the point of interest. Our algorithm is numerically stable for points that are arbitrarily close to the model, and explicitly treats points that are coincident with curves. We demonstrate the improvements in computational performance granted by this method over conventional techniques as well as the robustness induced by its application.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of kernel learning FBSDE filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel learning forward backward SDE filter is an iterative and adaptive meshfree approach to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. It builds from forward backward SDE for Fokker-Planker equation, which defines evolving density for the state variable, and employs KDE to approximate density. This algorithm has shown more superior performance than mainstream particle filter method, in both convergence speed and efficiency of solving high dimension problems.
  However, this method has only been shown to converge empirically. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis to demonstrate its local and global convergence, and provide theoretical support for its empirical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We come up with a novel application for image analysis methods in the context of direction dependent signal characteristics. For this purpose, we describe an inpainting approach adding benefit to technical signal information which are typically only used for monitoring and control purposes in ground station operations. Recalling the theoretical properties of the employed inpainting technique and appropriate modeling allow us to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for satellite data reception quality assessment. In our application, we show the advantages of inpainting products over raw data as well as the rich potential of the visualization of technical signal information.</description>

      <title>Stabler Neo-Hookean Simulation: Absolute Eigenvalue Filtering for Projected Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volume-preserving hyperelastic materials are widely used to model near-incompressible materials such as rubber and soft tissues. However, the numerical simulation of volume-preserving hyperelastic materials is notoriously challenging within this regime due to the non-convexity of the energy function. In this work, we identify the pitfalls of the popular eigenvalue clamping strategy for projecting Hessian matrices to positive semi-definiteness during Newton's method. We introduce a novel eigenvalue filtering strategy for projected Newton's method to stabilize the optimization of Neo-Hookean energy and other volume-preserving variants under high Poisson's ratio (near 0.5) and large initial volume change. Our method only requires a single line of code change in the existing projected Newton framework, while achieving significant improvement in both stability and convergence speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our eigenvalue projection scheme on a variety of challenging examples and over different deformations on a large dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large matrices arise in many machine learning and data analysis applications, including as representations of datasets, graphs, model weights, and first and second-order derivatives. Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) is an area which uses randomness to develop improved algorithms for ubiquitous matrix problems. The area has reached a certain level of maturity; but recent hardware trends, efforts to incorporate RandNLA algorithms into core numerical libraries, and advances in machine learning, statistics, and random matrix theory, have lead to new theoretical and practical challenges. This article provides a self-contained overview of RandNLA, in light of these developments.</description>
