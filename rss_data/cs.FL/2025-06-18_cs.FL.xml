      <title>A generalization of Deterministic Finite Automata related to discharging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are of central importance in automata theory. In view of how state diagrams for DFAs are defined using directed graphs, this leads us to introduce a generalization of DFAs related to a method widely used in graph theory referred to as the discharging method. Given a DFA $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F)$, the transition function $\delta\colon Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ determines a directed path in the corresponding state diagram based on an input string $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}$ consisting of characters in $\Sigma$, and our generalization can be thought of as being based on how each vertex in $D$ ''discharges'' rational values to adjacent vertices (by analogy with the discharging method) depending on the string $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}$ and according to a fixed set of rules. We formalize this notion and pursue an exploration of the notion of a Discharging Deterministic Finite Automaton (DDFA) introduced in this paper. Our DDFA construction gives rise to a ring structure consisting of sequences that we refer to as being quasi-$k$-regular, and this ring generalizes the ring of $k$-regular sequences introduced by Allouche and Shallit.</description>

      <title>Measure-Theoretic Aspects of Star-Free and Group Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A language $L$ is said to be ${\cal C}$-measurable, where ${\cal C}$ is a class of languages, if there is an infinite sequence of languages in ${\cal C}$ that ``converges'' to $L$. We investigate the properties of ${\cal C}$-measurability in the cases where ${\cal C}$ is SF, the class of all star-free languages, and G, the class of all group languages. It is shown that a language $L$ is SF-measurable if and only if $L$ is GD-measurable, where GD is the class of all generalised definite languages (a more restricted subclass of star-free languages). This means that GD and SF have the same ``measuring power'', whereas GD is a very restricted proper subclass of SF. Moreover, we give a purely algebraic characterisation of SF-measurable regular languages, which is a natural extension of Schutzenberger's theorem stating the correspondence between star-free languages and aperiodic monoids. We also show the probabilistic independence of star-free and group languages, which is an important application of the former result. Finally, while the measuring power of star-free and generalised definite languages are equal, we show that the situation is rather opposite for subclasses of group languages as follows. For any two local subvarieties ${\cal C} \subsetneq {\cal D}$ of group languages, we have $\{L \mid L \text{ is } {\cal C}\text{-measurable}\} \subsetneq \{ L \mid L \text{ is } {\cal D}\text{-measurable}\}$.</description>

      <title>Careful synchronisation and the diameter of transformation semigroups with few generators</title>

Abstract: A word is called carefully synchronising for a partial deterministic finite semi-automaton if it maps all states to the same state. Equivalently, it is a composition of partial transformations equal to a constant total transformation. There is a sequence of several papers providing stronger and stronger lower bounds on the length of shortest carefully synchronising words for $n$-state partial DFAs over small alphabets. It resulted in the lower bounds of $\Omega(\frac{2^{n/3}}{n\sqrt{n}})$ and $\Omega(\frac{4^{n/5}}{n})$ for alphabets of two and three letters respectively, obtained by de Bondt, Don, and Zantema. Using a significantly simpler construction, we improve these lower bounds to $2^{(n - 4)/3}$ and $4^{(n - 4)/5}$ respectively.
  We then consider a tightly related question of the diameter of a partial DFA, which is the smallest $\ell \ge 0$ such that words of length at most $\ell$ express all the transformations induced by words in this DFA. We show that an alphabet of large enough constant size already asymptotically matches the upper bound on the diameter for arbitrary alphabet size, extending the construction of Panteleev that requires an alphabet of size exponential in the number of states. We then discuss an application to the diameter of finite semigroups of nonnegative matrices, and some open problems.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Your Language Model One Byte at a Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.</description>

      <title>A Logic For Fresh Labelled Transition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion for Fresh Labelled Transition Systems (FLTSs). These are nominal labelled transition systems which keep track of the history, i.e. of data values seen so far, and can capture fresh data generation. In particular, FLTSs generalise the computations of Fresh-Register Automata, which in turn are one of the simplest classes of history-dependent automata operating on infinite input alphabets. Each automaton comes equipped with a finite set of registers where it can store data values and compare them with others from the input. In addition, the automaton can accept an input just if it be fresh: not seen in the computation before. The logic we introduce can express a variety of properties, such as the existence of an infinite path of distinct data values or the existence of a finite path where some taint property is violated. We study the model checking problem and its complexity via reduction to parity games and, using nominal sets techniques, provide an exponential upper bound for it.</description>
