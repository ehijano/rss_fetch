      <title>Approaching Kasteleyn transition in frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Kasteleyn transition, the abrupt proliferation of infinite strings of defects in classical dimer and related models, can also be relevant for frustrated 2d quantum magnets. This is explicitly demonstrated in a phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond-decorated honeycomb lattice where a family of exact eigenstates built as products of dimer and plaquette singlets can be mapped onto the dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice. The low-temperature properties of this phase are accurately described by an effective dimer model with anisotropic activities and a small, tunable density of monomers, leading to an arbitrarily sharp crossover version of the Kasteleyn transition. The generalization to other geometries and the possibility to realize this model in organo-metallic compounds are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of bit erasure in stochastic random access memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy costs of information processing are growing exponentially. Bit erasure is a key problem in this energy-information nexus, and a number of seminal relationships have been deduced regarding the relationship between thermodynamic costs and memory storage. To continue making progress in the modern era, however, requires confronting thermodynamic costs in realistic physical systems which operate away from equilibrium. Here, we explore the thermodynamic costs of bit erasure in a complementary metal oxide semiconductor model of two types of random access memory. We find dynamic random access memory dissipates the least amount of energy when operated in the quasistatic limit, where errors are also minimized. By contrast, static random access memory is most efficiently operated in finite time due to the energy required to maintain the state of the bit. We demonstrate a numerically robust optimization scheme using mean field theory and automatic differentiation, finding optimal protocols compatible with electrical engineering insights. These results provide a framework for operating realistic circuits in thermodynamically advantageous ways.</description>

      <title>Stiffness induced structures and morphological transitions in semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiflexible polymers in poor solvents exhibit a rich variety of collapsed morphologies, including globules, toroids, and rodlike bundles, arising from the competition between attractive interactions and chain stiffness. Computer simulations and experiments on stiff and conjugated polymers have revealed complex morphological crossovers, yet a unified theoretical description remains incomplete. Here we develop a coarse-grained, field-theoretic free-energy framework for linear polymers with variable stiffness that captures these morphologies and their transitions within a common description. The theory is built on three key ingredients: a density field describing monomer attraction and excluded-volume effects, a nematic order parameter accounting for orientational ordering in dense regions, and the bending rigidity of a worm-like chain. Using simple variational ansatzes for competing morphologies, we derive analytic expressions for their free energies and identify the boundaries separating coil, globule, toroidal, and rodlike conformational regimes as functions of the reduced attraction strength and the effective persistence length. The resulting phase-diagram topology provides a transparent free-energy-based framework for interpreting morphology diagrams observed in simulations and experiments on semiflexible polymers in poor solvents. We find the possibility of the existence of a triple point involving globules, rods and toroids.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Vortex Strings after a Thermal Quench in a Holographic Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.</description>

      <title>Vanishing correlations in (bi)stochastic controlled circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality with internal supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.</description>

      <title>The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</description>

      <title>Two-Qubit Spin-Boson Model in the Strong Coupling Regime: Coherence, Non-Markovianity, and Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.</description>

      <title>Critical and multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points in the local potential approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\eta$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\Delta=(d-2+\eta)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n&gt;1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Soft Random Geometric Graphs in General Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the choice of embedding geometry on the entropy of random geometric graph ensembles with soft connection functions. First we show that when the connection range is small, the entropy is dependent only on the dimension of the geometry and not the shape, but for large connection ranges the boundaries of the domain matter. Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic long-range two-body potentials. We show that the dynamics of local observables can be cast into a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy formulated in terms of the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time $t$, which we call the correlated fluid-cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and prove that it reproduces exactly the time evolution of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models, at all times. We validate these predictions against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. At late times, the one-particle distribution relaxes via a Boltzmann-type scattering integral encoding the interplay between integrable contact processes and long-range collisions, whereas higher-point correlations remain strongly non-thermal on thermalization time scales, indicative of a form of incomplete or generalised thermalisation. Focusing on long-range dipolar quantum gases, where the relevant matrix elements can be obtained explicitly, we show that our collision integral reduces exactly to the Fermi golden rule result and provide a complete theoretical account of the experimental observations of Tang et al. (Phys.Rev.X 8, 021030 (2018)). More broadly, our framework extends the BBGKY program to regimes with strong local interactions, and applies to a wide class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard-Jones molecular fluids.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. As such, these intermediate metastable states dominate the system's dynamics at coarse grained times. Moreover, they can strongly influence the overall pathways through which the energy landscape is explored. Thus, quantifying these metastabilities is crucial for uncovering the key details of the underlying landscape. Here, we introduce a robust method based on a generalized many-body Arrhenius law to identify metastable states in escape problems involving interacting particles with excluded volume. Experimental platforms such as colloidal transport or macromolecular translocation through biological pores can offer promising settings to validate our predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a protocol to generate an antiferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg model with the exact ground state based on a tree graph. The generated model has a correspondence with a tree graph and possesses the product state of singlet dimers as its unique ground state. A procedure for constructing a model with exact, massively degenerate ground states is also introduced.</description>

      <title>Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, eight-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensembles, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</description>

      <title>The influence of packing protocol, size ratio, and pore structure on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of systems of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) and constant pressure (CP) protocols, and the generalized Apollonian packing. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. We show that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, all three exponents coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. For the CP protocol, the exponents are different for both moderate and large size ratios. The suppression of the exponent of the structure factor in the CP packing is explained by the specific behaviour of pores, which contain relatively big cavities. We develop an algorithm for calculating the pore size distribution and show that it is related to the exponent of the structure factor. We argue that the presence of the cavities lowers the configuration entropy and thus reduces the randomness of the CP packing. Thus the cavities reduce both packing fraction and randomness of the CP packings. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum work statistics within the standard two-point measurement (TPM) scheme in continuously monitored quantum systems, including the effects of generalized unitary evolution, possibly controlled by quantum circuit models, and multiple generalized measurements as well as post-selection of no-click trajectories. We derive an explicit expression for the work generating function that naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.</description>

      <title>Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</description>

      <title>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable and, in principle, it can replace any previous use of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Analytical phase boundary of a quantum driven-dissipative Kerr oscillator from classical stochastic instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone, with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is, incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability exponents over all space-time frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>
