      <title>Prompt Engineering Guidance for Conceptual Agent-based Model Extraction using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document contains detailed information about the prompts used in the experimental process discussed in the paper "Toward Automating Agent-based Model Generation: A Benchmark for Model Extraction using Question-Answering Techniques". The paper aims to utilize Question-answering (QA) models to extract the necessary information to implement Agent-based Modeling (ABM) from conceptual models. It presents the extracted information in formats that can be read by both humans and computers (i.e., JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)), enabling manual use by humans and auto-code generation by Large Language Models (LLM).</description>

      <title>Transient Multi-Agent Path Finding for Lifelong Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding conflict-free paths for a set of agents from an initial configuration to a given target configuration. The Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problem is a well-studied online version of MAPF in which an agent receives a new target when it reaches its current target. The common approach for solving LMAPF is to treat it as a sequence of MAPF problems, periodically replanning from the agents' current configurations to their current targets. A significant drawback in this approach is that in MAPF the agents must reach a configuration in which all agents are at their targets simultaneously, which is needlessly restrictive for LMAPF. Techniques have been proposed to indirectly mitigate this drawback. We describe cases where these mitigation techniques fail. As an alternative, we propose to solve LMAPF problems by solving a sequence of modified MAPF problems, in which the objective is for each agent to eventually visit its target, but not necessarily for all agents to do so simultaneously. We refer to this MAPF variant as Transient MAPF (TMAPF) and propose several algorithms for solving it based on existing MAPF algorithms. A limited experimental evaluation identifies some cases where using a TMAPF algorithm instead of a MAPF algorithm with an LMAPF framework can improve the system throughput significantly.</description>

      <title>How to Correctly do Semantic Backpropagation on Language-based Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years, transitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being deployed in challenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these systems often requires substantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems can be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization. Despite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System Optimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components given feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize the concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a generalization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including reverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by exploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as a method for computing directional information about how changes to each component of an agentic system might improve the system's output. To use these gradients, we propose a method called semantic gradient descent which enables us to solve GASO effectively. Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving GASO problems. A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the parsimonious nature of our method.

      <title>HyperMARL: Adaptive Hypernetworks for Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing individual specialisation and shared behaviours is a critical challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Existing methods typically focus on encouraging diversity or leveraging shared representations. Full parameter sharing (FuPS) improves sample efficiency but struggles to learn diverse behaviours when required, while no parameter sharing (NoPS) enables diversity but is computationally expensive and sample inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce HyperMARL, a novel approach using hypernetworks to balance efficiency and specialisation. HyperMARL generates agent-specific actor and critic parameters, enabling agents to adaptively exhibit diverse or homogeneous behaviours as needed, without modifying the learning objective or requiring prior knowledge of the optimal diversity. Furthermore, HyperMARL decouples agent-specific and state-based gradients, which empirically correlates with reduced policy gradient variance, potentially offering insights into its ability to capture diverse behaviours. Across MARL benchmarks requiring homogeneous, heterogeneous, or mixed behaviours, HyperMARL consistently matches or outperforms FuPS, NoPS, and diversity-focused methods, achieving NoPS-level diversity with a shared architecture. These results highlight the potential of hypernetworks as a versatile approach to the trade-off between specialisation and shared behaviours in MARL.</description>

      <title>Machine Theory of Mind for Autonomous Cyber-Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent autonomous agents hold much potential for the domain of cyber-security. However, due to many state-of-the-art approaches relying on uninterpretable black-box models, there is growing demand for methods that offer stakeholders clear and actionable insights into their latent beliefs and motivations. To address this, we evaluate Theory of Mind (ToM) approaches for Autonomous Cyber Operations. Upon learning a robust prior, ToM models can predict an agent's goals, behaviours, and contextual beliefs given only a handful of past behaviour observations. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based ToM architecture tailored for cyber-defence, Graph-In, Graph-Out (GIGO)-ToM, which can accurately predict both the targets and attack trajectories of adversarial cyber agents over arbitrary computer network topologies. To evaluate the latter, we propose a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance for measuring the similarity of graph-based probability distributions. Whereas the standard Wasserstein distance lacks a fixed reference scale, we introduce a graph-theoretic normalization factor that enables a standardized comparison between networks of different sizes. We furnish this metric, which we term the Network Transport Distance (NTD), with a weighting function that emphasizes predictions according to custom node features, allowing network operators to explore arbitrary strategic considerations. Benchmarked against a Graph-In, Dense-Out (GIDO)-ToM architecture in an abstract cyber-defence environment, our empirical evaluations show that GIGO-ToM can accurately predict the goals and behaviours of various unseen cyber-attacking agents across a range of network topologies, as well as learn embeddings that can effectively characterize their policies.</description>

      <title>A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we propose Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach that operates in hybrid action spaces, enabling holistic decision-making and enhancing overall performance. We evaluated the performance of DHPG using simulations with a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset, comparing it to several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions. DHPG outperforms these solutions, guaranteeing the $99^{th}$ percentile of C-V2N service delay target, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social networks fundamentally shape human opinions, behaviors, and the dissemination of information. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama increasingly integrate into social and professional settings, understanding their behavior in the context of social interactions and network formation becomes essential. This study develops a framework to systematically examine whether the network formation behaviors of multiple LLMs approximate certain aspects of human network dynamics. By simulating interactions among LLM agents across various model families, we observe that these models consistently exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics, reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate, capturing personal and professional connections, while in employment networks, LLMs favor heterophily and high-degree connections, aligning with career advancement dynamics. These results open new avenues for using LLMs in network science research, with potential applications in agent-based modeling and synthetic network generation.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>
