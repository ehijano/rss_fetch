      <title>Jetter and Post nuclear fusion cycles: new fire to an old idea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New calculations of the time evolution and isotopic composition for a network of nuclear reactions breathe new life into an old idea in nuclear fusion, burning solid room temperature lithium-6 deuteride ($^6$LiD) with neutrons. Modern-day compilations of nuclear cross-sections are nowadays available and we use them to predict the full course of networks of thermonuclear reactions, re-examining the Jetter (n+$^6$Li) and Post cycles (p+$^6$Li), that offer great prospects for energy production in devices not based on plasma confinement. We present ideal calculations, i.e. not including the energy loss due to the Stopping power, and more realistic calculations that include the Bethe-Bloch formula. We find that a significant amount of energy can, in principle, be generated.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic coil optimization for reduced Lorentz forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction of magnetic forces on electromagnetic coils is an important consideration in the design of high-field devices such as the stellarator or tokamak. Unfortunately, these forces may be too time-consuming to evaluate by conventional finite element modeling within an optimization loop. Although mutual forces can be computed rapidly by approximating large-bore coils as infinitely thin, this approximation does not hold for self-forces as it leads to an unphysical divergence. Recently, a novel reduced model for the self-field, self-force, and self-inductance of electromagnetic coils based on filamentary models was rigorously derived and demonstrated to be highly accurate and numerically efficient to evaluate. In this paper, we present an implementation of the reduced self-force model employing automatic differentiation within the SIMSOPT stellarator design software and use it in derivative-based coil optimization for a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator. We show that it is possible to significantly reduce point-wise forces throughout the coils, though this comes with trade-offs to fast particle losses and the minimum distance between coils and the plasma surface. The trade-off between magnetic forces and coil-surface distance is mediated by the minimum coil-coil distance for coils near the inboard side of the "bean" cross-section of the plasma. The relationship between forces and fast particle losses is mediated by the normal field error. Coil forces can be lowered to a threshold with minimal deterioration to losses. Importantly, the magnet optimization approach here can be used also for tokamaks, other fusion concepts, and applications outside of fusion.</description>

      <title>Relativistic High-order Harmonic Beam Directionality Modulation by Pre-plasma Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a tunable pre-pulse is a common technique to enhance the high-order harmonic generation from surface plasma. The dynamic and structure of a pre-plasma is influenced by the intensity of ionization, heating, and expansion. Time delay between the pre-pulse and the main pulse serves as a crucial parameter for controlling the distribution of the pre-plasma density. The variation in harmonic emission directionality due to the density shape is investigated. Particle-in-cell simulations suggest that both plasma hydrodynamics and geometrical optical effect induces the deflection of harmonic beam from specular reflection. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of laser-plasma interaction conditions, which is important for the detection and optimizing of harmonic source performance.</description>

      <title>Radiatively Cooled Magnetic Reconnection Experiments Driven by Pulsed Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in astrophysical plasmas, responsible for the explosive conversion of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy. In extreme astrophysical systems, such as black hole coronae and neutron star magnetospheres, radiative cooling modifies the energy partition by rapidly removing internal energy. In this thesis, we perform experimental and computational studies of magnetic reconnection in a radiatively cooled regime, previously unexplored in reconnection studies. The Magnetic Reconnection on Z (MARZ) experiments consist of a dual exploding wire array, driven by a 20 MA peak, 300 ns rise time current generated by the Z pulsed-power machine (Sandia National Labs). The load generates oppositely-directed supersonic, super-Alfv\'enic, collisional plasma flows with anti-parallel magnetic fields, that generate a reconnection layer, in which the total cooling rate far exceeds the Alfv\'enic transit rate. Two- and three-dimensional simulations of the MARZ experiments are performed in GORGON, an Eulerian resistive magnetohydrodynamic code. The experiments confirm numerical predictions by providing evidence of plasmoid formation and strong radiative cooling. The findings in this thesis are of particular relevance to the generation of radiative emission from reconnection-driven astrophysical events, and to the global dynamics of reconnection in strongly cooled systems. The MARZ experiments also provide a novel platform for investigating radiative effects in high-energy-density and laboratory astrophysics experiments, and for validation of radiation magnetohydrodynamic and atomic spectroscopy codes.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of annular electron beams in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The annular electron beam has significant practical potential in high-energy physics and condensed matter physics, which can be used to edge-enhancement electron imaging, collimation of antiprotons in conventional linear accelerators, acceleration of positively particles like positrons, structured X-ray generation and manipulation of nanomaterials. The quality of an annular electron beam depends on its energy, flux and topology. In this article, we study the transport characteristics of annular electron beam in a plasma medium and propose a scheme to modify it. According to our theory and full three-dimensional LAPINS simulations, we have found that the self-generated magnetic field focuses the incident annular electron beam, enabling the adjustment of its annular width (AW). Besides, the annular electron beam, endowed with orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits contrasting transport characteristics compared to an electron beam devoid of OAM. The former requires an external magnetic field to ensure stable transportation in the plasma. Under the influence of this magnetic field, the radius of the annular electron beam oscillates periodically, with the direction of change whether increasing or decreasing dependent on the field's strength. In this case, the radius of annular electron beam will be affected by the external magnetic field and allows for the simultaneous adjustment of its radius and AW, significantly broadening its application range.</description>

      <title>Reducing turbulent transport in tokamaks by combining intrinsic rotation and the low momentum diffusivity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of a large number of high-fidelity nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a novel strategy to improve confinement in tokamak plasmas by combining up-down asymmetric flux surface shaping with the Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. We show that the intrinsic momentum flux driven by up-down asymmetry creates strong flow shear in the LMD regime that can significantly reduce energy transport, increasing the critical gradient by up to $25\%$. In contrast to traditional methods for generating flow shear, such as neutral beam injection, this approach requires no external momentum source and is expected to scale well to large fusion devices. The experimental applicability of this strategy in spherical tokamaks is addressed via simulations by considering actual equilibria from MAST and a preliminary equilibrium from SMART.</description>

      <title>Magnetic diffusion in Solar atmosphere produces measurable electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient release of magnetic energy in astrophysical plasmas, such as during solar flares, can in principle be achieved through magnetic diffusion, at a rate determined by the associated electric field. However, attempts at measuring electric fields in the solar atmosphere are scarce, and none exist for sites where the magnetic energy is presumably released. Here, we present observations of an energetic event using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, where we detect the polarization signature of electric fields associated with magnetic diffusion. We measure the linear and circular polarization across the hydrogen H-epsilon Balmer line at 397 nm at the site of a brightening event in the solar chromosphere. Our spectro-polarimetric modeling demonstrates that the observed polarization signals can only be explained by the presence of electric fields, providing conclusive evidence of magnetic diffusion, and opening a new window for the quantitative study of this mechanism in space plasmas.</description>

      <title>On the Acceleration of the Young Solar Wind from Different Source Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of the young solar wind is studied using the first 17 encounters of Parker Solar Probe. We identify wind intervals from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e. the inner boundaries of coronal holes. We present their statistical trends in the acceleration process. Most of the observations can be reproduced by a two-fluid hydrodynamic model with realistic corona temperatures. In such a model, the solar wind is accelerated by the combined thermal pressures of protons and electrons,but it is mainly the difference in the proton pressure that leads to the difference in the solar wind speed. The proton pressure is the highest in the fastest CH wind, with a high initial proton temperature that decreases slowly. It is lower in the relatively slow LMBL wind, and the lowest in the slowest streamer wind. The proton temperature is quadratically correlated with the wind speed when scaled to the same distance. In contrast, the electron temperature shows no significant differences for different wind types or wind speeds, indicating more similar contributions from the electron pressure. The model gives reasonable locations for the sonic critical point, which is on average at 3.6-7.3 solar radii and can also extend to large distances when the proton temperature is extremely low, as in the LMBL wind. In addition to the thermal pressure, we raise the possibility that Alfv\'en waves may contribute to the solar wind acceleration, especially for the fast CH wind.</description>

      <title>Solar Plasma Noise in TianQin Laser Propagation: An Extreme Case and Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\% of TianQin's requirement to less than 1\%.</description>

      <title>On the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Irregularities under Geomagnetically Active and Quiet Conditions using NavIC observables: A Spectral Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionospheric irregularities and associated scintillations under geomagnetically active/quiet conditions have detrimental effects on the reliability and performance of space- and ground-based navigation satellite systems, especially over the low-latitude region. The current work investigates the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities using the phase screen theory and the corresponding temporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to present an estimate of the outer irregularity scale sizes over these locations. The study uses simultaneous L5 signal C/N$_o$ observations of NavIC (a set of GEO and GSO navigation satellite systems) near the northern crest of EIA (Indore: 22.52$^\circ$N, 75.92$^\circ$E, dip: 32.23$^\circ$N) and in between the crest and the dip equator (Hyderabad: 17.42$^\circ$N, 78.55$^\circ$E, dip: 21.69$^\circ$N). The study period (2017-2018) covers disturbed and quiet-time conditions in the declining phase of the solar cycle 24. The PSD analysis brings forward the presence of irregularities, of the order of a few hundred meters during weak-to-moderate and quiet-time conditions and up to a few km during the strong event, over both locations. The ROTI values validate the presence of such structures in the Indian region. Furthermore, only for the strong event, a time delay of scintillation occurrence over Indore, with values of 36 minutes and 50 minutes for NavIC satellites (PRNs) 5 and 6, respectively, from scintillation occurrence at Hyderabad is observed, suggesting a poleward evolution of irregularity structures. Further observations show a westward propagation of these structures on this day. This study brings forward the advantage of utilizing continuous data from the GEO and GSO satellite systems in understanding the evolution and propagation of the ionospheric irregularities over the low-latitude region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong multi-kilotesla magnetic fields have various applications in high-energy density science and laboratory astrophysics, but they are not readily available. In our previous work [Y. Shi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 155101 (2023)], we developed a novel approach for generating such fields using multiple conventional laser beams with a twist in the pointing direction. This method is particularly well-suited for multi-kilojoule petawatt-class laser systems like SG-II UP, which are designed with multiple linearly polarized beamlets. Utilizing three-dimensional kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we examine critical factors for a proof-of-principle experiment, such as laser polarization, relative pulse delay, phase offset, pointing stability, and target configuration, and their impact on magnetic field generation. Our general conclusion is that the approach is very robust and can be realized under a wide range of laser parameters and plasma conditions. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the axial magnetic field configuration, azimuthal electron current, and electron and ion orbital angular momentum densities. Supported by a simple model, our analysis shows that the axial magnetic field decays due to the expansion of hot electrons.</description>

      <title>First Ion Temperature Measurements in the MAST-U Divertor via Retarding Field Energy Analyzer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first ion temperature (\(T_i\)) measurements from the MAST-U divertor using a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA). Embedded within the flat tile of the closed divertor chamber, the RFEA captures \(T_i\) profiles across various plasma scenarios, including transitions to the Super-X configuration. Measurements were conducted under steady-state and transient plasma conditions characterized by a plasma current (\(I_p\)) of 750 kA, electron density (\(n_e\)) between \(2.2 \times 10^{19}\) and \(4.45 \times 10^{19}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from 3.0 MW to 3.2 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 17 eV in steady state, were compared with electron temperatures (\(T_e\)) obtained from Langmuir probes (LP) at identical radial positions. The study also examined ion saturation current density (\(J_{\text{sat}}\)) signals to using methodologies similar to previous MAST experiments. Preliminary findings reveal a \(T_i/T_e\) ratio ranging from 1 to 2.2. Additionally, high temporal resolution measurements (100 $\mu s$) captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), showing \(T_i\) peaks at 16.03 +- 1.84 eV during ELM events, nearly three times higher than inter-ELM temperatures.</description>

      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory~(FPT) of dynamical systems, initially developed for investigating the shifts of invariant (un)stable manifolds within chaotic regions when subjected to global perturbations. In contrast, invariant tori reside in the ordered regions of the phase space, where periodic orbits are parabolic in conservative systems. For example, in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) devices, invariant tori appear as closed flux surfaces, whose nested structure dominates radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance. This Letter provides formulae characterizing the deformation of invariant tori under perturbation.</description>

Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>

      <title>Laser-FLASH: radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source</title>

Abstract: Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.</description>
