      <description>arXiv:2409.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with non-Baire rare sets in category bases which forms $\aleph_0$-independent family, where a rare set is a common generalization of both Luzin and Sierpinski set.</description>

      <title>$\omega$-well-filtered spaces, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a $T_0$ topological space is $\omega$-well-filtered if and only if it does not admit either the natural numbers with the cofinite topology or with the Scott topology as its closed subsets in the strong topology. Based on this, we offer a refined topological characterization for the $\omega$-well-filterification of $T_0$-spaces and solve a problem posed by Xiaoquan Xu. In the setting of second countable spaces, we also characterise sobriety by convergences of certain $\Pi^0_2$-Cauchy subsets of the spaces.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'{e} completeness of function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A space is called Dieudonn\'{e} complete if it is complete relative to the maximal uniform structure compatible with its topology. In this paper, we investigated when the function space $C(X,Y)$ of all continuous functions from a topological space $X$ into a uniform space $Y$ with the topology of uniform convergence on a family of subsets of $X$ is Dieudonn\'{e} complete. Also we proved a generalization of the Eberlein-\v{S}mulian theorem to the class of Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Products of two sober dcpo's need not be sober</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two dcpo's whose Scott spaces are sober, but the Scott space of their order product is not sober. This answers an open problem on the sobriety of Scott spaces. Meantime, we show that if $M$ and $N$ are special type of sober complete lattices, then the Scott space of their order product $M\times N$ is sober.</description>

      <title>Statistically characterized subgroups related to some non-arithmetic sequence of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in Das et al. (Mediterr. J. Math. 21 : 164, 2024), characterized subgroups are investigated for some special kind of non-arithmetic sequences. In this note, we study subsequent problems in case of ``statistically characterized subgroups" introduced in Dikranjan et al. (Fund. Math. 249 : 185-209, 2020). The entire investigation emphasizes that these statistically characterized subgroups are mostly larger in size, having cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$, and exhibit behavior that significantly differs from that of classically characterized subgroups. As a consequence, we solve an open problem raised in Dikranjan et al. (Fund. Math. 249 : 185-209, 2020).</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>
