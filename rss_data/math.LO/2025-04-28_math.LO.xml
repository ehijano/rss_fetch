      <title>Isomorphism Classes of Generating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any two regular cardinals $\omega&lt;\lambda_0&lt;\lambda_1$ there is a ccc forcing extension where there is an ultrafilter $U$ on $\omega$ with a base $\mathcal{B}$ such that $(\mathcal{B},\supseteq^*)\cong \lambda_0\times\lambda_1$. We use similar ideas to construct an ultrafilter with a base $\mathcal{B}$ as above which is order isomorphic to any given two-dimensional, well-founded, countably directed order with no maximal element. Similarly, relative to a supercompact cardinal, it is consistent that $\kappa$ is supercompact, and for any regular cardinals $\kappa&lt;\lambda_0&lt;\lambda_1&lt;...&lt;\lambda_n$, there is a ${&lt;}\kappa$-directed closed $\kappa^+$-cc forcing extension where there is a normal ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ with a base $\mathcal{B}$ such that $(\mathcal{B},\supseteq^*)\cong \lambda_0\times...\times\lambda_n$. We apply our constructions to obtain ultrafilters with controlled Tukey-type, in particular, an ultrafilter with non-convex Tukey and depth spectra is presented, answering questions from [4]. Our construction also provides new models where $\mathfrak{u}_\kappa&lt;2^\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Borel graphs and cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a cohomological criterion for certain decomposition of Borel graphs, which is an analog of Dunwoody's work on accessibility of groups. As an application, we prove that a Borel graph $(X,G)$ with uniformly bounded degrees of cohomological dimension one is Lipschitz equivalent to a Borel acyclic graph on $X$. This gives a new proof of a result of Chen-Poulin-Tao-Tserunyan on Borel graphs with components quasi-isometric to trees.</description>

      <title>Tree Rewriting Calculi for Strictly Positive Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strictly positive logics in the language $\mathscr{L}^+$, which constructs formulas from $\top$, propositional variables, conjunction, and diamond modalities. We begin with the base system $\bf K^+$, the strictly positive fragment of polymodal $\bf K$, and examine its extensions obtained by adding axioms such as monotonicity, transitivity, and the hierarchy-sensitive interaction axiom $(\sf J)$, which governs the interplay between modalities of different strengths. The strongest of these systems is the Reflection Calculus ($\bf RC$), which corresponds to the strictly positive fragment of polymodal $\bf GLP$.
  Our main contribution is a formulation of these logics as tree rewriting systems, establishing both adequacy and completeness through a correspondence between $\mathscr{L}^+$ formulas and inductively defined modal trees. We also provide a normalization of the rewriting process, which has exponential complexity when axiom $(\sf J)$ is absent; otherwise we provide a double-exponential bound. By introducing tree rewriting calculi as practical provability tools for strictly positive logics, we aim to deepen their proof-theoretic analysis and computational applications.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity in Coxeter groups and split crystallographic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that affine Coxeter groups, even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and one-ended hyperbolic Coxeter groups are homogeneous in the sense of model theory. More generally, we prove that many (Gromov) hyperbolic groups generated by torsion elements are homogeneous. In contrast, we construct split crystallographic groups that are not homogeneous, and hyperbolic (in fact, virtually free) Coxeter groups that are not homogeneous (or, to be more precise, not $\mathrm{EAE}$-homogeneous). We also prove that, on the other hand, irreducible split crystallographic groups and torsion-generated hyperbolic groups are almost homogeneous. Along the way, we give a new proof that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely rigid. We also introduce the notion of profinite homogeneity and prove that finitely generated abelian-by-finite groups are profinitely homogeneous if and only if they are homogenenous, thus deducing in particular that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely homogeneous, a result of independent interest in the profinite context.</description>

      <title>Generalized cardinal invariants for an inaccessible $\kappa$ with compactness at $\kappa^{++}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if the existence of a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ with a weakly compact cardinal $\lambda$ above $\kappa$ is consistent, then the following are consistent as well (where $\mathfrak{t}(\kappa)$ and $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ are the tower number and the ultrafilter number, respectively):
  (i) There is an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa^+ &lt; \mathfrak{t}(\kappa)= \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)&lt; 2^\kappa$ and $SR(\kappa^{++})$ hold, and
  (ii) There is an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa^+ = \mathfrak{t}(\kappa) &lt; \mathfrak{u}(\kappa)&lt; 2^\kappa$ and $SR(\kappa^{++}), TP(\kappa^{++})$ and $\neg wKH(\kappa^+)$ hold.
  The cardinals $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ and $2^\kappa$ can have any reasonable values in these models. We obtain these results by combining the forcing construction from Brooke-Taylor, Fischer, Friedman and Montoya with the Mitchell forcing and with (new and old) indestructibility results for compactness principles. Apart from $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$ and $\mathfrak{t}(\kappa)$ we also compute the values of $\mathfrak{b}(\kappa)$, $\mathfrak{d}(\kappa)$, $\mathfrak{s}(\kappa)$, $\mathfrak{r}(\kappa)$, $\mathfrak{a}(\kappa)$, $\mathrm{cov}(M_\kappa)$, $\mathrm{add}(M_\kappa)$, $\mathrm{non}(M_\kappa)$, $\mathrm{cof}(M_\kappa)$ which will all be equal to $\mathfrak{u}(\kappa)$.
  In (ii), we compute $\mathfrak{p}(\kappa) = \mathfrak{t}(\kappa) = \kappa^+$ by observing that the $\kappa^+$-distributive quotient of the Mitchell forcing adds a tower of size $\kappa^+$.
  Finally, we observe that (i) and (ii) hold also for the traditional invariants on $\kappa = \omega$, using Mitchell forcing up to a weakly compact cardinal; in this case we also obtain the disjoint stationary sequence property $DSS(\omega_2)$, which implies the negation of the approachability property $\neg AP(\omega_2)$.</description>

      <title>Witnessed Symmetric Choice and Interpretations in Fixed-Point Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07869v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the core of the quest for a logic for PTime is a mismatch between algorithms making arbitrary choices and isomorphism-invariant logics. One approach to overcome this problem is witnessed symmetric choice. It allows for choices from definable orbits which are certified by definable witnessing automorphisms.
  We consider the extension of fixed-point logic with counting (IFPC) with witnessed symmetric choice (IFPC+WSC) and a further extension with an interpretation operator (IFPC+WSC+I). The latter operator evaluates a subformula in the structure defined by an interpretation. This structure possibly has other automorphisms exploitable by the WSC-operator. For similar extensions of pure fixed-point logic (IFP) it is known that IFP+WSCI simulates counting which IFP+WSC fails to do. For IFPC+WSC it is unknown whether the interpretation operator increases expressiveness and thus allows studying the relation between WSC and interpretations beyond counting.
  We separate IFPC+WSC from IFPC+WSCI by showing that IFPC+WSC is not closed under FO-interpretations. By the same argument, we answer an open question of Dawar and Richerby regarding non-witnessed symmetric choice in IFP. Additionally, we prove that nesting WSC-operators increases the expressiveness using the so-called CFI graphs. We show that if IFPC+WSC+I canonizes a particular class of base graphs, then it also canonizes the corresponding CFI graphs. This differs from various other logics, where CFI graphs provide difficult instances.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>
