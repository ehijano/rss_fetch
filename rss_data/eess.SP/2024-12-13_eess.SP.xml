      <title>COST INTERACT Whitepaper on Signal Processing for Communications, Localization, and Intergrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming next generation of wireless communication is anticipated to revolutionize the conventional functionalities of the network by adding sensing and localization capabilities, low-power communication, wireless brain computer interactions, massive robotics and autonomous systems connection. Furthermore, the key performance indicators expected for the 6G of mobile communications promise challenging operating conditions, such as user data rates of 1 Tbps, end-to-end latency of less than 1 ms, and vehicle speeds of 1000 km per hour. This evolution needs new techniques, not only to improve communications, but also to provide localization and sensing with an efficient use of the radio resources. The goal of INTERACT Working Group 2 is to design novel physical layer technologies that can meet these KPI, by combining the data information from statistical learning with the theoretical knowledge of the transmitted signal structure. Waveforms and coding, advanced multiple-input multiple-output and all the required signal processing, in sub-6-GHz, millimeter-wave bands and upper-mid-band, are considered while aiming at designing these new communications, positioning and localization techniques. This White Paper summarizes our main approaches and contributions.</description>

      <title>A Physics-based Generative Model to Synthesize Training Datasets for MRI-based Fat Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques have potential to optimize scan and post-processing times required for MRI-based fat quantification, but they are constrained by the lack of large training datasets. Generative models are a promising tool to perform data augmentation by synthesizing realistic datasets. However no previous methods have been specifically designed to generate datasets for quantitative MRI (q-MRI) tasks, where reference quantitative maps and large variability in scanning protocols are usually required. We propose a Physics-Informed Latent Diffusion Model (PI-LDM) to synthesize quantitative parameter maps jointly with customizable MR images by incorporating the signal generation model. We assessed the quality of PI-LDM's synthesized data using metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), obtaining comparable scores to state-of-the-art generative methods (FID: 0.0459). We also trained a U-Net for the MRI-based fat quantification task incorporating synthetic datasets. When we used a few real (10 subjects, $~200$ slices) and numerous synthetic samples ($&gt;3000$), fat fraction at specific liver ROIs showed a low bias on data obtained using the same protocol than training data ($0.10\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.12\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$) and on data acquired with an alternative protocol ($0.14\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_1$, $0.62\%$ at $\hbox{ROI}_2$). Future work will be to extend PI-LDM to other q-MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis and Modeling of Penetration Loss for Building Materials in FR1 and FR3 bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on analysis and modeling of the penetration loss of typical building materials in the FR1 (450 MHz-6 GHz) and FR3 (7-24 GHz) bands based on experimental measurements. Firstly, we measure the penetration loss characteristics of four different typical building materials from 4 to 16 GHz, including wood, glass, foam and concrete, by using a penetration loss measurement platform based on the vector network analyzer (VNA). Next, we analyze the frequency dependence and thickness dependence of penetration loss. Finally, the linear model is applied to fit the curve of the measured penetration loss, and new model parameters for the penetration loss of different building materials are given, which are compared with that in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report (TR) 38.901. The analysis results and new model parameters may provides insight into understanding propagation characteristics in FR1 and FR3 bands and 3GPP channel model standardisation.</description>

      <title>Residual Channel Boosts Contrastive Learning for Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to address the issue of limited data samples for the deployment of pre-trained models in unseen environments, this paper proposes a residual channel-based data augmentation strategy for Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI), coupled with a lightweight SimSiam contrastive learning framework. By applying least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimations followed by equalization, signals with different residual channel effects are generated. These residual channels enable the model to learn more effective representations. Then the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with 1% samples in a novel environment for RFFI. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both feature extraction ability and generalization while requiring fewer samples and less time, making it suitable for practical wireless security applications.</description>

      <title>Fully Bayesian Wideband Direction-of-Arrival Estimation and Detection via RJMCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian approach to wideband, or broadband, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and signal detection. Unlike previous works in wideband DoA estimation and detection, where the signals were modeled in the time-frequency domain, we directly model the time-domain representation and treat the non-causal part of the source signal as latent variables. Furthermore, our Bayesian model allows for closed-form marginalization of the latent source signals by leveraging conjugacy. To further speed up computation, we exploit the sparse ``stripe matrix structure'' of the considered system, which stems from the circulant matrix representation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This drastically reduces the time complexity of computing the likelihood from $\mathcal{O}(N^3 k^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N k^3)$, where $N$ is the number of samples received by the array and $k$ is the number of sources. These computational improvements allow for efficient posterior inference through reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). We use the non-reversible extension of RJMCMC (NRJMCMC), which often achieves lower autocorrelation and faster convergence than the conventional reversible variant. Detection, estimation, and reconstruction of the latent source signals can then all be performed in a fully Bayesian manner through the samples drawn using NRJMCMC. We evaluate the detection performance of the procedure by comparing against generalized likelihood ratio testing (GLRT) and information criteria.</description>

      <title>WiFo: Wireless Foundation Model for Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter aims to provide sensing capabilities for a potential eavesdropper, while simultaneously enabling the secure communications with the legitimate users in a cell-free multipleinput multiple-output system with limited fronthaul links. In order to maximize the sensing performance, the joint design of fronthaul compression and beamforming is proposed considering the constraints on the finite fronthaul-capacity links and the maximum power along with the worst-case secrecy rate requirements. To this end, we propose an algorithmic solution based on the minorization-maximization method and semidefinite programming relaxation techniques, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations compared to the reference schemes such as distributed sensing and random beamforming.</description>

      <title>Towards Wireless-Native Big AI Model: Insights into Its Ambitions, Peculiarities and Methodologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researches on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks are emerging. However, since the breakthrough in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occurs in natural language processing, there is still a lack of a clear technical roadmap on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems with many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper first reviews recent research works on BAIM for wireless and assesses the current research situation. Then, this paper analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing BAIM technology in a wireless-native way, as well as new issues that need to be considered in specific technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless system, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for how to develop wireless-native BAIM.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Covert Communications with Statistical CSI: A Multiport Network Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel framework for covert communications aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is proposed. In this general framework, the use of multiport network theory for modelling the RIS consider various aspects that traditional RIS models in communication theory often overlook, including mutual coupling between elements and the impact of structural scattering. Moreover, the transmitter has only limited knowledge about the channels of the warden and the intended receiver. The proposed approach is validated through numerical results, demonstrating that communication with the legitimate user is successfully achieved while satisfying the covertness constraint.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shaping for Nonlinearity Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the input probability distribution of a discrete-time channel is a standard step in the information-theoretic analysis of digital communication systems. Nevertheless, many practical communication systems transmit uniformly and independently distributed symbols drawn from regular constellation sets. The introduction of the probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture has renewed interest in using optimized probability distributions, i.e., probabilistic shaping. Traditionally, probabilistic shaping has been employed to reduce the transmit power required for a given information rate over additive noise channels. While this translates into substantive performance gains for optical fiber communication systems, the interaction of shaping and fiber nonlinearity has posed intriguing questions. At first glance, probabilistic shaping seems to exacerbate nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) due to larger higher-order standardized moments. Therefore, the optimization of shaping distributions must differ from those used for linear channels. Secondly, finite-length effects related to the memory of the nonlinear fiber channel have been observed. This suggests that the marginal input-symbol distribution is not the only consideration. This paper provides a tutorial-style discussion of probabilistic shaping for optical fiber communication. Since the distinguishing property of the channel is the signal-dependent NLIN, we speak of probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity tolerance. Our analysis builds on the first-order time-domain perturbation approximation of the nonlinear fiber channel and revisits the notion of linear and nonlinear shaping gain. We largely focus on probabilistic amplitude shaping with popular shaping methods. The concept of shaping via sequence selection is given special consideration, as it inherently optimizes a multivariate distribution for shaped constellations.</description>

      <title>Capacitive Touch Sensor Modeling With a Physics-informed Neural Network and Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations are the fundamental equations for understanding electric and magnetic field interactions and play a crucial role in designing and optimizing sensor systems like capacitive touch sensors, which are widely prevalent in automotive switches and smartphones. Ensuring robust functionality and stability of the sensors in dynamic environments necessitates profound domain expertise and computationally intensive multi-physics simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based surrogate model to accelerate the design process. The PINN model solves the governing electrostatic equations describing the interaction between a finger and a capacitive sensor. Inputs include spatial coordinates from a 3D domain encompassing the finger, sensor, and PCB, along with finger distances. By incorporating the electrostatic equations directly into the neural network's loss function, the model captures the underlying physics. The learned model thus serves as a surrogate sensor model on which inference can be carried out in seconds for different experimental setups without the need to run simulations. Efficacy results evaluated on unseen test cases demonstrate the significant potential of PINNs in accelerating the development and design optimization of capacitive touch sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and Internet of Things, multi-robot systems are progressively acquiring human-like environmental perception and understanding capabilities, empowering them to complete complex tasks through autonomous decision-making and interaction. However, the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) faces significant challenges in terms of spectrum resources, sensing accuracy, communication latency, and energy supply. To address these issues, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided IoRT network is proposed to enhance the overall performance of robotic communication, sensing, computation, and energy harvesting. In the case studies, by jointly optimizing parameters such as transceiver beamforming, robot trajectories, and RIS coefficients, solutions based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization are proposed to solve problems such as beamforming design, path planning, target sensing, and data aggregation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed solutions in improve communication quality, sensing accuracy, computation error, and energy efficiency of RIS-aided IoRT networks.</description>

      <title>Learned Compression for Compressed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization algorithm with initialization analysis for r-local and k-sparse unlabeled sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlabeled sensing is a linear inverse problem with permuted measurements. We propose an alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm with a suitable initialization for two widely considered permutation models: partially shuffled/$k$-sparse permutations and $r$-local/block diagonal permutations. Key to the performance of the AltMin algorithm is the initialization. For the exact unlabeled sensing problem, assuming either a Gaussian measurement matrix or a sub-Gaussian signal, we bound the initialization error in terms of the number of blocks $s$ and the number of shuffles $k$. Experimental results show that our algorithm is fast, applicable to both permutation models, and robust to choice of measurement matrix. We also test our algorithm on several real datasets for the linked linear regression problem and show superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>

Abstract: As new wireless standards are developed, the use of higher operation frequencies comes in hand with new use cases and propagation effects that differ from the well-established state of the art. Numerous stochastic fading models have recently emerged under the umbrella of generalized fading conditions to provide a fine-grain characterization of propagation channels in the mmWave and sub-THz bands. For the first time in literature, this work carries out an experimental validation of a class of such ray-based models in a wide range of propagation conditions (anechoic, reverberation and indoor scenarios) at mmWave bands. These models allow to characterize the communication channel with a reduced number of physically interpretable parameters. In specific, we show that the independent fluctuating two-ray (IFTR) model has good capabilities to recreate rather dissimilar environments with high accuracy and only four parameters. We also put forth that the key limitations of the IFTR model arise in the presence of reduced diffuse propagation, and also due to a limited phase variability for the dominant specular components.</description>

      <title>Towards Distributed and Intelligent Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the distributed and intelligent integrated sensing and communications (DISAC) concept, a transformative approach for 6G wireless networks that extends the emerging concept of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). DISAC addresses the limitations of the existing ISAC models and, to overcome them, it introduces two novel foundational functionalities for both sensing and communications: a distributed architecture (enabling large-scale and energy-efficient tracking of connected users and objects, leveraging the fusion of heterogeneous sensors) and a semantic and goal-oriented framework (enabling the transition from classical data fusion to the composition of semantically selected information).</description>

      <title>Transmit Beamforming Design for ISAC with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a transmit beamforming strategy for the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems enabled by the novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) architecture, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs downlink communication and radar target detection via different beams. To ensure superior dual-function performance simultaneously, we design the multi-layer cascading beamformer by maximizing the sum rate of the users while optimally shaping the normalized beam pattern for detection. A dual-normalized differential gradient descent (D3) algorithm is further proposed to solve the resulting non-convex multi-objective problem (MOP), where gradient differences and dual normalization are employed to ensure a fair trade-off between communication and sensing objectives. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beamforming design in terms of balancing communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Exact equality of the MSEs for two types of nonlinear adaptive systems: Saturation and dead-zone types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive signal processing systems, commonly utilized in applications such as active noise control and acoustic echo cancellation, often encompass nonlinearities due to hardware components such as loudspeakers, microphones, and amplifiers. Examining the impact of these nonlinearities on the overall performance of adaptive systems is critically important. In this study, we employ a statistical-mechanical method to investigate the behaviors of adaptive systems, each containing an unknown system with a nonlinearity in its output. We specifically address two types of nonlinearity: saturation and dead-zone types. We analyze both the dynamic and steady-state behaviors of these systems under the effect of such nonlinearities. Our findings indicate that when the saturation value is equal to the dead-zone width, the mean square errors (MSEs) in steady states are identical for both nonlinearity types. Furthermore, we derive a self-consistent equation to obtain the saturation value and dead-zone width that maximize the steady-state MSE. We theoretically clarify that these values depend on neither the step size nor the variance of background noise.</description>

      <title>Designing Unimodular Waveforms with Good Correlation Properties for Large-Scale MIMO Radar via Manifold Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design constant modulus probing waveforms with good correlation properties for large-scale collocated multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar systems. The main content is as follows: First, we formulate the design problem as a fourth-order polynomial minimization problem with unimodulus constraints. Then, by analyzing the geometric properties of the unimodulus constraints through Riemannian geometry theory and embedding them into the search space, we transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on a Riemannian manifold for solution. Second, we convert the objective function into the form of a large but finite number of loss functions and employ a customized R-SVRG algorithm to solve it. Third, we prove that the customized R-SVRG algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge if appropriate parameters are chosen. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R-SVRG algorithm.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earthquake science and seismology rely on the ability to associate seismic waves with their originating earthquakes. Earthquake detection algorithms based on deep learning have progressed rapidly and now routinely detect microearthquakes with unprecedented clarity, providing information about fault dynamics on increasingly finer spatiotemporal scales. However, this densification of detections can overwhelm existing techniques for phase association which rely on fixed wave speed models and associate events one by one. These methods fail when the event rates become high or where the 4D complexity of elastic wave speeds cannot be ignored. Here, we introduce HARPA, a deep learning solution to this problem. HARPA is a high-rate association framework which incorporates wave physics by leveraging deep generative models and travel time neural fields. Instead of associating events one by one, it lifts arrival sequences to probability distributions and compares them using an optimal transport metric. The generative travel time neural fields are used to estimate the wave speed simultaneously with association. HARPA outperforms state-of-the-art association methods for both real seismic data and complex synthetic models and paves the way for improved understanding of seismicity while establishing a new seismic data analysis paradigm.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Input and State Estimation for Multi-agent System with Dynamic Topology and Heterogeneous Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.</description>

      <title>Personalized Coupled Tensor Decomposition for Multimodal Data Fusion: Uniqueness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled tensor decompositions (CTDs) perform data fusion by linking factors from different datasets. Although many CTDs have been already proposed, current works do not address important challenges of data fusion, where: 1) the datasets are often heterogeneous, constituting different "views" of a given phenomena (multimodality); and 2) each dataset can contain personalized or dataset-specific information, constituting distinct factors that are not coupled with other datasets. In this work, we introduce a personalized CTD framework tackling these challenges. A flexible model is proposed where each dataset is represented as the sum of two components, one related to a common tensor through a multilinear measurement model, and another specific to each dataset. Both the common and distinct components are assumed to admit a polyadic decomposition. This generalizes several existing CTD models. We provide conditions for specific and generic uniqueness of the decomposition that are easy to interpret. These conditions employ uni-mode uniqueness of different individual datasets and properties of the measurement model. Two algorithms are proposed to compute the common and distinct components: a semi-algebraic one and a coordinate-descent optimization method. Experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed framework compared with the state of the art approaches.</description>
