      <title>Network-driven discovery of repurposable drugs targeting hallmarks of aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the thousands of genes implicated in age-related phenotypes, effective interventions for aging remain elusive, a lack of advance rooted in the multifactorial nature of longevity and the functional interconnectedness of the molecular components implicated in aging. Here, we introduce a network medicine framework that integrates 2,358 longevity-associated genes onto the human interactome to identify existing drugs that can modulate aging processes. We find that genes associated with each hallmark of aging form a connected subgraph, or hallmark module, a discovery enabling us to measure the proximity of 6,442 clinically approved or experimental compounds to each hallmark. We then introduce a transcription-based metric, $pAGE$, which evaluates whether the drug-induced expression shifts reinforce or counteract known age-related expression changes. By integrating network proximity and $pAGE$, we identify multiple drug repurposing candidate that not only target specific hallmarks but act to reverse their aging-associated transcriptional changes. Our findings are interpretable, revealing for each drug the molecular mechanisms through which it modulates the hallmark, offering an experimentally falsifiable framework to leverage genomic discoveries to accelerate drug repurposing for longevity.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Drug Repurposing through miRNA-mRNA Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: miRNA mRNA relations are closely linked to several biological processes and disease mechanisms In a recent study we tested the performance of large language models LLMs on extracting miRNA mRNA relations from PubMed PubMedBERT achieved the best performance of 0.783 F1 score for miRNA mRNA Interaction Corpus MMIC Here we first applied the finetuned PubMedBERT model to extract miRNA mRNA relations from PubMed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Alzheimers disease AD stroke type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM chronic liver disease and cancer Next we retrieved miRNA drug relations using KinderMiner a literature mining tool for relation extraction Then we constructed three interaction networks 1 disease centric network 2 drug centric network and 3 miRNA centric network comprising 3497 nodes and 16417 edges organized as a directed graph to capture complex biological relationships Finally we validated the drugs using MIMIC IV Our integrative approach revealed both established and novel candidate drugs for diseases under study through 595 miRNA drug relations extracted from PubMed To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to systematically extract and visualize relationships among four distinct biomedical entities miRNA mRNA drug and disease</description>

      <title>Resilience of the positive gene autoregulation loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression in response to stimuli is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) through feedback loop motifs, aimed at maintaining the desired TF concentration despite uncertainties and perturbations. In this work, we consider a stochastic model of the positive gene autoregulating feedback loop and we probabilistically quantify its resilience, \textit{i.e.}, its ability to preserve the equilibrium associated with a prescribed concentration of TFs, and the corresponding basin of attraction, in the presence of noise. We show that the formation of larger oligomers, corresponding to larger Hill coefficients of the regulation function, and thus to sharper non-linearities, improves the system resilience, even close to critical concentrations of TFs. We also explore a complementary definition of resilience that can be assessed within a stochastic formulation relying on the Fokker-Planck equation. Our formal results are accompanied by numerical simulations.</description>
