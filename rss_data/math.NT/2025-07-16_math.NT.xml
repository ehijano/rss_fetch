      <title>The $3$-sparsity of $X^n-1$ over finite fields, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$, the polynomial $X^n - 1 \in \mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is termed $3$-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if all its irreducible factors in $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ are either binomials or trinomials. In 2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$. Recently, the author provided a complete characterization for odd $q$. This paper extends the investigation to finite fields of even characteristic, fully determining all $n$ such that $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for even $q$. This work resolves two open problems posed by Oliveira and Reis for even characteristic case.</description>

      <title>Primes in Arithmetic Progressions to Large Moduli and Siegel Zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q&lt;x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Murmurations using Petersson trace formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the murmuration phenomenon, which is a correlation between signs of functional equations and Fourier coefficients, in the case of modular forms in the weight aspect. We in particular improve the range of visibility of murmurations compared to previous results. This is the first approach to the murmuration phenomenon using a relative trace formula, showing its robustness.</description>

      <title>Density of solutions for systems of forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Cappell-Shaneson polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Cappell and J. Shaneson constructed a pair of inequivalent embeddings of $(n-1)$-spheres in homotopy $(n+1)$-spheres for every square matrix of order $n$ with special properties (a Cappell-Shaneson matrix). A Cappell-Shaneson polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of a Cappell-Shaneson matrix. In this paper, we interpret part of the definition of Cappell-Shaneson polynomial as algebraic conditions on polynomials in terms of signed reciprocal polynomial and reduction modulo primes, and give complete lists of all Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degrees $4$ and $5$. We construct several infinite series of Cappell-Shaneson polynomials of degree $6$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of matchable sets and subspaces via Dyson transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ to another subset $B$ is a bijection $f : A \to B$ such that $a f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. The study of matchings began in the 1990s and was motivated by a conjecture of E. K. Wakeford on canonical forms for homogeneous polynomials. The theory was later extended to the linear-algebraic setting of vector subspaces over field extensions, and then to matroids. In this paper, we investigate the existence and structure of matchings in both abelian groups and field extensions. Using Dyson's $e$-transform, a tool from additive combinatorics, along with a linear analogue which is introduced in this paper, we establish characterization theorems for matchable sets and subspaces. Several applications are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these theorems as standalone tools. Throughout, we highlight the parallels between the group-theoretic and linear-algebraic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Beatty multiple shift is introduced, which is a generalization of the multiplicative shift of finite type (multiple SFT) [Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems, 2012] and the affine multiple shift [Ban, Hu, Lai and Liao, Advances in Mathematics, 2025]. The Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension formulas are obtained, and the coefficients of the formula is closely related to the classical disjoint covering of the positive integers in number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Raynaud's theory of formal models from rigid-analytic spaces over a nonarchimedean field to uniform qcqs adic spaces $X$, with no finite-type assumptions, over an arbitrary Tate affinoid base $S$. The key new ingredient is the notion of a normalized formal blow-up which takes on the role played by admissible formal blow-ups in the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional statistics for finite orbits of generalised continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We statistically compare the relationships between frequencies of digits in continued fraction expansions of typical rational points in the unit interval and higher dimensional generalisations. This takes the form of a Large Deviation and Central Limit Theorem, including multidimensional results for random vectors. These results apply to classical multidimensional continued fraction transformations including Brun's algorithm and the Jacobi--Perron algorithm, and more generally for maps satisfying mild contraction hypothesis on the inverse branches. We prove in particular that the finite trajectories capture the generic ergodic behaviour of infinite trajectories.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of random polynomials of $\mathbb{Z}[X]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Bary-Soroker, Koukoulopoulos and Kozma proved that when $A$ is a random monic polynomial of $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ of deterministic degree $n$ with coefficients $a_j$ drawn independently according to measures $\mu_j,$ then $A$ is irreducible with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to\infty$ under a condition of near-uniformity of the $\mu_j$ modulo four primes (which notably happens when the $\mu_j$ are uniform over a segment of $\mathbb Z$ of length $N\ge 35.$) We improve here the speed of convergence when we have the near-uniformity condition modulo more primes. Notably, we obtain the optimal bound $\mathbb{P}(A \text{ irreducible}) = 1 -O(1/\sqrt n)$ when we have near-uniformity modulo twelve primes, which notably happens when the $\mu_j$ are uniform over a segment of length $N\ge 10^8.$</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <title>Unramified Grothendieck-Serre for isotropic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grothendieck-Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group $G$ over a regular semilocal ring $R$ is trivial. We establish this for unramified $R$ granted that $G^{\mathrm{ad}}$ is totally isotropic, that is, has a "maximally transversal" parabolic $R$-subgroup. We also use purity for the Brauer group to reduce the conjecture for unramified $R$ to simply connected $G$--a much less direct such reduction of Panin had been a step in solving the equal characteristic case of Grothendieck-Serre. We base the group-theoretic aspects of our arguments on the geometry of the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_G$, instead of the affine Grassmannian used previously, and we quickly reprove the crucial weak $\mathbb{P}^1$-invariance input: for any reductive group $H$ over a semilocal ring $A$, every $H$-torsor $\mathscr{E}$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ satisfies $\mathscr{E}|_{\{t = 0\}} \simeq \mathscr{E}|_{\{t = \infty\}}$. For the geometric aspects, we develop reembedding and excision techniques for relative curves with finiteness weakened to quasi-finiteness, thus overcoming a known obstacle in mixed characteristic, and show that every generically trivial torsor over $R$ under a totally isotropic $G$ trivializes over every affine open of $\mathrm{Spec}(R) \setminus Z$ for some closed $Z$ of codimension $\ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: We define Poisson genericity for infinite sequences in any finite or countable alphabet with an invariant exponentially-mixing probability measure. A sequence is Poisson generic if the number of occurrences of blocks of symbols asymptotically follows a Poisson law as the block length increases. We prove that almost all sequences are Poisson generic. Our result generalizes Peres and Weiss' theorem about Poisson genericity of integral bases numeration systems. In particular, we obtain that their continued fraction expansions for almost all real numbers are Poisson generic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</description>
