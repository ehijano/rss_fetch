      <title>Asymptotic Momentum of Dirac Particles in One Space Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the trajectories of a massive particle in one space dimension whose motion is guided by a spin-half wave function that evolves according to the free Dirac equation, with its initial wave function being a Gaussian wave packet with a nonzero expected value of momentum $k$ and the positive expected value of energy $E = \sqrt{m^2+k^2}$. We prove that at large times, the wave function becomes {\em locally} a plane wave, which corresponds to trajectories with fixed values for asymptotic momentum $k$ and asymptotic energy $E$ or $-E$. The sign of the asymptotic energy is determined by the initial position of the particle. Particles with negative energy will have an asymptotic velocity that is in the opposite direction of their momentum.
  The proof uses the stationary phase approximation method, for which we establish a rigorous error bound.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mean-Fields Spin Systems in a Random External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider general exchangeable quantum mean-field Hamiltonian such as the prominent quantum Curie-Weiss model under the influence of a random external field. Despite being arguably the simplest class of disordered quantum systems, the random external field breaks the symmetry of the mean-field Hamiltonian and hence standard quantum de Finetti type or semiclassical arguments are not directly applicable. We introduce a novel strategy in this context, which can be seen as non-commutative large deviation analysis, allowing us to characterize the limiting free energy in terms of a simple and explicit variational formula. The proposed method is general enough to be used for other classes of mean-field models such as multi species Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Chaos, Ito-Stratonovich dilemma, and topological supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently established that the formalism of the generalized transfer operator (GTO) of dynamical systems (DS) theory, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of arbitrary form, belongs to the family of cohomological topological field theories (TFT) -- a class of models at the intersection of algebraic topology and high-energy physics. This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive "pressure", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.</description>

      <title>The Loring--Schulz-Baldes Spectral Localizer Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral localizer, introduced by Loring in 2015 and Loring and Schulz-Baldes in 2017, is a method to compute the (infinite volume) topological invariant of a quantum Hamiltonian on $\ZZ^d$, as the signature of the (finite) localizer matrix. We present a direct and elementary spectral-theoretic proof treating the $d=1$ and $d=2$ cases on an almost equal footing. Moreover, we re-interpret the localizer as a higher-dimensional topological insulator via the bulk-edge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Geometry and quantum brachistochrone analysis of multiple entangled spin-1/2 particles under all-range Ising interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric and dynamical framework for a physical system consisting of $n$ spin-$1/2$ particles with all-range Ising interaction. Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space.</description>

      <title>Convolution identities for complex-indexed divisor functions and modular graph functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find exact identities for sums of the form \begin{equation*}\label{eq:convsumabs}
  \sum_{\stackrel{n_1+n_2 = n}{n_1 \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0, n \} }} Q(n_1,n_2) \sigma_{-r_1}(n_1) \sigma_{-r_2}(n_2),
  \end{equation*}
  where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $r_1,r_2\in\mathbb{C}$, $Q$ is a combination of hypergeometric functions, and $\sigma_{a}(x)$ denotes the divisor function. Specifically,
  we find that they can be expressed in terms of Fourier coefficients of Hecke cusp forms weighted by their $L$-values. This result expands upon previous work with Radchenko in which such identities were found for divisor functions with even integer index \cite{FKLR} and encompasses results of Jacobi \cite{motohashi1994binary} and Diamantis and O'Sullivan in \cite{diamantis2010kernels, o2023identities} for divisor functions with odd integer index. The proof of our result expresses these sums in terms of Estermann zeta functions and uses trace formulae. In addition, we use a regularization of divergent convolution sums to provide a mathematical explanation for $L$-values (non-critical in the sense of Deligne) appearing in modular graph functions \cite{DKS2021_2}.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Fusion in a (2+1)-dimensional Lattice Model with Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the dynamics of Toda curves of order $N$ and derive differential equations governing this dynamics. We apply the obtained results to describe isoperiodic deformations of $N$-periodic Toda chains and periodic difference Korteweg-de Vries equation. We describe deformations of the essential spectra of $N$-periodic two-sided Jacobi matrices. We also study singular regimes of $SU(N)$ Seiberg-Witten theory and describe their deformations preserving the number of singularities where new massless particles may occur. We introduce and describe isoequilibrium deformations of arbitrary collections of $d$ real disjoint closed intervals. We conclude by providing explicit triangular solutions to constrained Schlesinger systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of solutions to the Fokas-Lenells equation for any initial data in a weighted Sobolev space $H^{3}(\mathbb{R})\cap H^{2,1}(\mathbb{R})$.This result removes all spectral restrictions on the initial data required in our previous work.
  The proof primarily relies on the inverse scattering transform formulated as new Riemann-Hilbert problems and Zhou's $L^{2}$-Sobolev bijectivity theory.</description>

      <title>Shock Formation for Compressible Euler Equations on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the finite-time shock formation for the compressible Euler equations on the two-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. In contrast to the flat Euclidean case $\mathbb{R}^2$, the geometry of $\mathbb S^2$ imposes new difficulties, and the fluid dynamics are affected by the curved background. To overcome these challenges, we modify the existing modulation method and employ a set of carefully constructed, time-dependent coordinates that precisely track the shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$. In particular, we first perform a time-dependent rotation of $\mathbb S^2$, then apply the stereographic projection to the sphere, straighten the steepening shock front, and finally construct shock-adapted coordinates. In the shock-adapted coordinates, the compressible Euler equations on $\mathbb{S}^2$ can be recast into a form suitable for self-similar analysis. Within this framework, we implement a detailed bootstrap argument and establish global well-posedness for the self-similar system. After transferring these results back to the original physical system, we thereby demonstrate the finite-time shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Search for Topological Protection in Open Quantum Hardware: The Dissipative Mixed Hodge Module Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard spectroscopic protocols model the dynamics of open quantum systems as a superposition of isolated, exponentially decaying eigenmodes. This paradigm fails fundamentally at Exceptional Points, where the eigenbasis collapses and the response becomes dominated by non-diagonalizable Jordan blocks. We resolve this ambiguity by introducing a geometric framework based on \textit{Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules} (DMHM). By replacing the scalar linewidth with a topological \textit{Weight Filtration}, we derive ``Weight Filtered Spectroscopy'' (WFS)--a protocol that spatially separates decay channels based on the nilpotency rank of the Liouvillian. We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Averaging on Dynamic Graphs with Selective Neighborhood Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time consensus model in which agents iteratively update their states through interactions on a dynamic social network. At each step, a single agent is selected asynchronously and averages the values of its current neighbors. A distinctive feature of our model is that an agent's neighborhood may contract following an update, while non-selected agents may add or remove neighbors independently. This creates a time-varying communication structure with endogenous contraction. We show that under mild assumptions--specifically, that the evolving graph is connected infinitely often--the system reaches consensus almost surely. Our results extend classical consensus theory on time-varying graphs and asynchronous updates by introducing selective neighborhood contraction, offering new insights into agreement dynamics in evolving social systems.</description>

      <title>Bethe-ansatz study of the Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional mixture of bosons and spinless fermions with contact interactions. In this system, the excitations at low energies are described by four linearly dispersing modes characterized by two excitation velocities. Here we study the velocities in a system with equal interaction strengths and equal masses of bosons and fermions. The resulting model is integrable and admits an exact Bethe-ansatz solution. We analyze it and analytically derive various exact results, which include the Drude weight matrix. We show that the excitation velocities can be calculated from the knowledge of the matrices of compressibility and the Drude weights, as their squares are the eigenvalues of the product of the two matrices. The elements of the Drude weight matrix obey certain sum rules as a consequence of Galilean invariance. Our results are consistent with the presence of a momentum-momentum coupling term between the two subsystems of bosons and fermions in the effective low-energy Hamiltonian. The analytical method developed in the present study can be extended to other models that possess a nested Bethe-ansatz structure.</description>

      <title>Extensions of a commuting pair of quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of algebras $\mathcal{A}_{M,N}$, $M,N\in\mathbb{Z}$, as an extension of a pair of commuting quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ subalgebras $\mathcal{E}_1,\check{\mathcal{E}}_1$, wherein the parameters are tuned in a specific way according to $M,N$. In the case $M=\pm 1$, algebra $\mathcal{A}_{\pm1,N}$ is a shifted quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra introduced in [FJM2]. Conjecturally there is a coproduct homomorphism $\mathcal{A}_{M,N_1+N_2}\to\mathcal{A}_{M,N_1}\hat\otimes\mathcal{A}_{M,N_2}$ to a completed tensor product, whose restriction to the subalgebras $\mathcal{E}_1,\check{\mathcal{E}}_1$ coincides with the standard coproduct of the latter. We give examples of $\mathcal{A}_{M,N}$ modules constructed on certain direct sums of tensor products of Fock modules of $\mathcal{E}_1\otimes\check{\mathcal{E}}_1$.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Nonunitary A-D-E minimal models: Coset graph fusion algebras, defects, entropies, SREEs and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider both unitary and nonunitary A-D-E minimal models on the cylinder with topological defects along the non-contractible cycle of the cylinder. We define the coset graph $A \otimes G/\mathbb{Z}_2$ and argue that it encodes not only the (i) coset graph fusion algebra, but also (ii) the Affleck-Ludwig boundary g-factors; (iii) the defect g-factors (quantum dimensions) and (iv) the relative symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. By studying A-D-E restricted solid-on-solid models, we find that these boundary conformal field theory structures are also present on the lattice: defects (seams) are implemented by face weights with special values of the spectral parameter. Integrability allows the study of lattice transfer matrix T- and Y-system functional equations to reproduce the fusion algebra of defect lines. The effective central charges and conformal weights are expressed in terms of dilogarithms of the braid and bulk asymptotics of the Y-system expressed in terms of the quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Cohomological Framework for Topological Phases from Momentum-Space Crystallographic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallographic groups are conventionally studied in real space to characterize crystal symmetries. Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $\Gamma_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})\cong H^n\big(\Gamma_F,\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\big)$ for $ n\ge 1$, where $\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\mathbb{R}^d_F$. The case $n=1$ yields a complete set of topological invariants formulated in purely algebraic terms, which differs fundamentally from the conventional formulation in terms of differential forms. The case $n=2$, analogously, provides a fully algebraic description for all such twistings. Thus, the cohomological theory of MCGs serves as a key technical framework for analyzing crystalline topological phases within the general setting of projective symmetry.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation for 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with nonzero random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new solution $(R,K)$ to the three-dimensional reflection equation, a boundary analogue of the tetrahedron equation. The $R$-operator is the one obtained by Sun, Terashima, Yagi, and the authors in 2024, involving four quantum dilogarithms with arguments in the $q$-Weyl algebra. The new $K$-operator similarly involves ten such quantum dilogarithms. Our approach is based on the quantum cluster algebra associated with the symmetric butterfly quiver on the wiring diagram of type C.</description>

Abstract: We propose a rigorous, physically interpretable, and quantifiable definition of the photonic nanojet (PNJ). This framework resolves longstanding ambiguities in measuring PNJ dimensions and leverages an optimal mass transport-based metric to quantify PNJ quality. Building on this metric, we develop a PNJ steering methodology that requires no opto-mechanical intervention, relying solely on phase-only illumination modulation.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of black hole event horizon births: a contact geometry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result by Penrose establishes that null geodesics generating a black hole event horizon can only intersect at their entrance to the horizon in ``crossover'' points. This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called "crease set". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux &amp; Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux &amp; Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.</description>

Abstract: We construct Lax pairs for the recently (2023) introduced integrable PDE systems known as the BKM equations. As many known and previously studied integrable systems are special cases of the BKM systems, our construction provides Lax pairs for many integrable hierarchies, including previously studied ones such as Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, and Marvan-Pavlov, as well as new ones. The corresponding pair is related to a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line whose potential depends rationally on the spectral parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $(d+1)$-dimensional field theory with a periodic spatial dimension may be approximated by a $d$-dimensional theory with a truncated Kaluza-Klein tower of $k$ fields; as $k\to\infty$, one recovers the original $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. One may similarly expect that $\operatorname U(1)$-valued Maxwell theory may be approximated by $\mathbb Z_k$-valued gauge theory and that, as $k\to\infty$, one recovers the original Maxwell theory. However, this fails: the $k\to\infty$ limit of $\mathbb Z_k$-valued gauge theory is flat Maxwell theory with no local degrees of freedom. We instead construct field theories $\mathcal T_k$ such that, with appropriate matter couplings, the $k\to\infty$ limit does recover Maxwell theory in the absence of magnetic monopoles (but with possible Wilson loops), and show that $\mathcal T_k$ can be understood as Maxwell theory with the insertion of a certain nonlocal operator that projects out principal $\operatorname U(1)$-bundles that do not arise from principal $\mathbb Z_k$-bundles sectors (in particular, projecting out sectors with monopole charges).</description>

Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Representations of Josephson junction on the unit circle and the derivations of Mathieu operators and Fraunhofer patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian J of the Josephson junction is introduced as a self-adjoint operator on l2 tensor l2. It is shown that J can also be realized as a self-adjoint operator HS1 on L2(S1) tensor L2(S1), from which a Mathieu operator given by "-d^2/d{\theta}^2 - 2{\alpha} cos {\theta}" is derived. A fiber decomposition of HS1 with respect to the total particle number is established, and the action on each fiber is analyzed. In the presence of a magnetic field, a phase shift defines the magnetic Josephson junction Hamiltonian HS1({\Phi}) and the Josephson current IS1({\Phi}). For a constant magnetic field inducing a local phase shift {\Phi}(x), the corresponding local current IS1({\Phi}(x)) is computed, and it is proved that the Fraunhofer pattern arises naturally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hierarchy of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable equations is constructed using the loop extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. This hierarchy includes $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Liouville, sinh-Gordon, cosh-Gordon, and, in particular, the mKdV equations. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded KdV equation is also derived from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equation via the Miura transformation. We present explicit formulas for the conserved charges of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-KdV and $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equations. A distinctive feature of these $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable systems is the existence of conserved charges with nontrivial grading.</description>

      <title>The Focusing NLS Equation on the Half-Line with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3264</link>
      <description>arXiv:0711.3264v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet problem for the focusing NLS equation on the half-line, with given Schwartz initial data and boundary data $q(0,t)$ equal to an exponentially decaying perturbation $u(t)$ of the periodic boundary data $ a e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ at $x=0.$ It is known from PDE theory that this problem admits a unique solution (for fixed initial data and fixed $u$). On the other hand, the associated inverse scattering transform formalism involves the Neumann boundary value for $x=0$. Thus the implementation of this formalism requires the understanding of the "Dirichlet-to-Neumann" map which characterises the associated Neumann boundary value.
  We consider this map in an indirect way: we postulate a certain Riemann-Hilbert problem, on a specified contour but with partially unspecified jump data of some generality, and then prove that the solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the focusing NLS constructed through this Riemann-Hilbert problem satisfies all the required properties: the data $q(x,0)$ are Schwartz and $q(0,t)-a e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ is exponentially decaying.
  More specifically, we focus on the case $-3a^2 &lt; \omega &lt; a^2.$ By considering a large class of appropriate scattering data for the t-problem, we provide solutions of the above Dirichlet problem such that the data $q_x(0,t)$ is given by an exponentially decaying perturbation of the function $2iab e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon},$ where $\omega = a^2-2b^2,~~b&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <title>The spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random conductance model in a line segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and principle eigenfunction of the random walk in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of the random walk jumping from site $x$ to site $x+1$ and vice versa. Writing $r^{(N)}(x, x+1) := 1/c^{(N)}(x, x+1)$, under the assumption \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{N}\sup_{1&lt; m \le N}\, \left| \sum_{x=2}^m r^{(N)}(x-1, x)- (m-1) \right|\;=\;0\,, \end{equation*} we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by $\mathrm{gap}_{N}$, of the process satisfies $\mathrm{gap}_{N}=(1+o(1))\pi^2/N^2$ and the principle eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding to the spectral gap is well approximated by $h_N(x) := \cos\left( (x-1/2)\pi/N \right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinor bilinears of generalized spinors and their properties are investigated. Generalized Killing and twistor spinor equations are considered and their relations to the equations satisfied by special types of differential forms are found. Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Identifying convex obstacles from backscattering far field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recovery of anomalies from backscattering far field data is a long-standing open problem in inverse scattering theory. We make a first step in this direction by establishing the unique identifiability of convex impenetrable obstacles from backscattering far field measurements. Specifically, we prove that both the boundary and the boundary conditions of the convex obstacle are uniquely determined by the far field pattern measured in backscattering directions for all frequencies. The key tool is Majda's asymptotic estimate of the far field patterns in the high-frequency regime. Furthermore, we introduce a fast and stable numerical algorithm for reconstructing the boundary and computing the boundary condition. A key feature of the algorithm is that the boundary condition can be computed even if the boundary is not known, and vice versa. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistics Forbids Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Bosons and Fermions in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum matter in three spatial dimensions is observed to consist exclusively of bosons and fermions. Whether this empirical fact follows from basic consistency requirements of quantum theory itself or must be imposed as an additional principle has for 80 years remained a fundamental conceptual gap. Here we close this gap by establishing a no-go theorem that excludes any particle exchange statistics beyond bosons and fermions in three dimensions. We identify the consistency conditions linking the many-body Hilbert-space structure of quantum mechanics with the statistical microstate counting of indistinguishable particles. As a corollary, we demonstrate that higher-dimensional representations of the symmetric group cannot give rise to genuinely distinct particle exchange statistics in any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenenergy \( E_n = \rho_n(1 - \rho_n) \) has been constructed, where \( \rho_n \) denotes the \( n \)-th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian using modular forms.Although our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture (since the eigenstates corresponding to \( E_n \) are \emph{not} normalizable), it provides a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). In particular, we propose a physical interpretation of RH, which could offer a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also a proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We to define a Stochastic Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold $(M,g)$ and considering the dynamics of a particle evolving between to fixed endpoints with a referential non-degenerate classical trajectory. Through fibration, we reduce the infinite-dimensional space under consideration to an $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process associated to a Gaussian measure. The Path Integral is subsequently defined as an expectation value with respect to the Gaussian measure, allowing us to rigorously formulate the former as a functional integral. We prove equivalence of the Stochastic Path Integral to the Euclidean Path Integral theory and the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Logarithmic Spectral Phase Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is deformed to a logarithmically modified self-adjoint operator \begin{equation*} F_\beta(H) = H + \beta H \log \frac{H}{E_*} \end{equation*} for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$ and a fixed reference scale $E_* &gt; 0$. Dynamical phases acquire energy-dependent factors $\exp[-it\beta E \log(E/E_*)]$, whose rapid variation across the spectrum suppresses interference between distinct energies through a non-stationary-phase mechanism. Stationary-phase analysis shows that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$ when $|\beta|$ is large.
  Since $F_\beta(H)$ is self-adjoint for every real $\beta$, the evolution operator $U_\beta(t) = \exp[-itF_\beta(H)]$ is unitary. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- Hilbert-space inner products, projection operators, the Born rule -- remains unchanged. Decoherence arises as suppression of interference terms in coarse-grained observables and decoherence functionals, not as norm loss or stochastic collapse. Physical motivation for logarithmic spectral deformations comes from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections introducing $\log E$ terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses with complex actions generating spectral factors involving $\log(E/E_{\text{P}})$. The mechanism is illustrated with two-level systems, quartic oscillators, FRW minisuperspace models, and Schwarzschild-interior-type Hamiltonians. Current superconducting-qubit coherence times constrain $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-5}$; trapped ions, NV centers, and cold atoms could strengthen this to $|\beta| \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>
