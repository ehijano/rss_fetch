      <title>UEFA Champions League entry is incentive incompatible again from the 2024/25 season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tournament is called incentive incompatible if it allows for a situation where a team could be strictly better off by losing. This paper uncovers that the entry rules of the UEFA Champions League, the most prestigious club football competition in Europe, suffer from this shortcoming again from the 2024/25 season. Consequently, a match with misaligned incentives has been barely avoided in the 2023/24 German Bundesliga. Two straightforward solutions are recommended. Fairness can be easily guaranteed by reversing the order of two paragraphs in the UEFA Champions League regulation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation with the diversity of cooperation tendencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete cooperation and the complete defection are two typical strategies considered in evolutionary games in many previous works. However, in real life, strategies of individuals are full of variety rather than only two complete ones. In this work, the diversity of strategies is introduced into the weak prisoners' dilemma game, which is measured by the diversity of the cooperation tendency. A higher diversity means more cooperation tendencies are provided. The complete cooperation strategy is the full cooperation tendency and the complete defection strategy is without any cooperation tendency. Agents with other cooperation tendencies behave as partial cooperators and as partial defectors simultaneously. The numerical simulation shows that increasing the diversity of the cooperation tendency promotes the cooperation level, not only the number of cooperators but also the average tendency over the whole population, until the diversity reaches its saturated value. Furthermore, our work points out maintaining cooperation is based on the cooperation efficiency approximating to the reward of cooperators and that the cooperation efficiency oscillates and quickly decreases to zero when cooperator clusters cannot resist the invasion of defectors. When the effect of the noise for the Femi update mechanism is considered, a higher diversity of strategies not only improves the cooperation level of the whole population but also supports the survival of more rational agents.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often struggle to accurately capture real-world dynamics due to their inability to address the inherent heterogeneity of populations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates heterogeneity through a mobility variable, transforming the traditional ODE system into a system of integro-differential equations that describe the dynamics of population densities across different compartments. Our results show that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to classic compartmental models, whose population densities are represented as Dirac delta functions in our density-based framework. This addresses the overestimation issue common in many classical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the time series of the infected population is sufficient to uniquely identify the mobility distribution. We reconstruct this distribution using a machine-learning-based framework, providing both theoretical and algorithmic support to effectively constrain the mobility-based model with real-world data.</description>

      <title>Circular transformation of the European steel industry renders scrap metal a strategic resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steel industry is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 7% of global emissions. The European steel industry is seeking to reduce its emissions by increasing the use of electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which can produce steel from scrap, marking a major shift towards a circular steel economy. Here, we show by combining trade with business intelligence data that this shift requires a deep restructuring of the global and European scrap trade, as well as a substantial scaling of the underlying business ecosystem. We find that the scrap imports of European countries with major EAF installations have steadily decreased since 2007 while globally scrap trade started to increase recently. Our statistical modelling shows that every 1,000 tonnes of EAF capacity installed is associated with an increase in annual imports of 550 tonnes and a decrease in annual exports of 1,000 tonnes of scrap, suggesting increased competition for scrap metal as countries ramp up their EAF capacity. Furthermore, each scrap company enables an increase of around 79,000 tonnes of EAF-based steel production per year in the EU. Taking these relations as causal and extrapolating to the currently planned EAF capacity, we find that an additional 730 (SD 140) companies might be required, employing about 35,000 people (IQR 29,000-50,000) and generating an additional estimated turnover of USD 35 billion (IQR 27-48). Our results thus suggest that scrap metal is likely to become a strategic resource. They highlight the need for a massive restructuring of the industry's supply networks and identify the resulting growth opportunities for companies.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB), which are both symmetry metrics intended to detect gerrymandering. We consider vote-share, seat-share pairs $(V, S)$ for which one can construct election data having vote share $V$ and seat share $S$, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of vote-share, seat share pairs $(V, S)$ for which there is constructed election data with vote share $V$, seat share $S$, and $MM=0$, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of $(V,S)$ pairs. We show how the set of such $(V,S)$ pairs allowing for $MM=0$ (and $PB=0$) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to be different.
  Although the set of $(V,S)$ pairs for which there is election data with $MM=0$ is the same as the set of $(V,S)$ pairs for which there is election data with $PB=0$, the range of possible values for MM and PB on a fixed $(V, S)$ is different. Additionally, for a fixed constructed election outcome, the values of the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias can theoretically be as large as 0.5. We show empirically that these two metric values can differ by as much as 0.33 in US congressional map data. We use both neutral ensemble analysis and the short-burst method to show that neither the Mean-Median Difference nor the Partisan Bias can reliably detect when a districting map has an extreme number of districts won by a particular party. Finally, we give additional empirical and logical arguments in an attempt to explain why other metrics are better at detecting when a districting map has an extreme number of districts won by a particular party.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Elite and Mass Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for quantifying polarization in social networks typically report a single value describing the amount of polarization in a social system. While this approach can be used to confirm the observation that many societies have witnessed an increase in political polarization in recent years, it misses the complexities that could be used to understand the reasons behind this phenomenon. Notably, opposing groups can have unequal impact on polarization, and the elites are often understood to be more divided than the masses, making it critical to differentiate their roles in polarized systems. We propose a method to characterize these distinct hierarchies in polarized networks, enabling separate polarization measurements for these groups within a single social system. Applied to polarized topics in the Finnish Twittersphere surrounding the 2019 and 2023 parliamentary elections, our analysis reveals valuable insights: 1) The impact of opposing groups on observed polarization is rarely balanced, and 2) while the elite strongly contributes to structural polarization and consistently display greater alignment across various topics, the masses have also recently experienced a surge in issue alignment, a special form of polarization. Our findings suggest that the masses may not be as immune to an increasingly polarized environment as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Timeliness criticality in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex systems, external parameters often determine the phase in which the system operates, i.e., its macroscopic behavior. For nearly a century, statistical physics has extensively studied systems' transitions across phases, (universal) critical exponents, and related dynamical properties. Here we consider the functionality of systems, notably operations in socio-technical ones, production in economic ones and, more generally, any schedule-based system, where timing is of crucial importance. We introduce a stylized model of delay propagation on temporal networks, where the magnitude of delay-mitigating buffer acts as a control parameter. The model exhibits {\it timeliness criticality}, a novel form of critical behavior. We characterize fluctuations near criticality, commonly referred to as ``avalanches'', and identify the corresponding critical exponents. The model exhibits timeliness criticality also when run on real-world temporal systems such as production networks. Additionally, we explore potential connections with the Mode-Coupling Theory of glasses, the depinning transition and the directed polymer problem.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Language in Social Media Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of digital platforms on user behavior presents foundational challenges, including issues related to polarization, misinformation dynamics, and variation in news consumption. Comparative analyses across platforms and over different years can provide critical insights into these phenomena. This study investigates the linguistic characteristics of user comments over 34 years, focusing on their complexity and temporal shifts. Utilizing a dataset of approximately 300 million English comments from eight diverse platforms and topics, we examine the vocabulary size and linguistic richness of user communications and their evolution over time. Our findings reveal consistent patterns of complexity across social media platforms and topics, characterized by a nearly universal reduction in text length, diminished lexical richness, but decreased repetitiveness. Despite these trends, users consistently introduce new words into their comments at a nearly constant rate. This analysis underscores that platforms only partially influence the complexity of user comments. Instead, it reflects a broader, universal pattern of human behaviour, suggesting intrinsic linguistic tendencies of users when interacting online.</description>
