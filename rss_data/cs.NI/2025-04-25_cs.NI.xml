      <title>Enhanced load balancing technique for SDN controllers: A multi-threshold approach with migration of switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying multiple controllers in the control panel of software-defined networks increases scalability, availability, and performance, but it also brings challenges, such as controller overload. To address this, load-balancing techniques are employed in software-defined networks. Controller load balancing can be categorized into two main approaches: (1) single-level thresholds and (2) multi-level thresholds. However, previous studies have predominantly relied on single-level thresholds, which result in an imprecise classification of controllers or have assumed uniform controller capacities in multi-level threshold methods. This study explores controller load balancing with a focus on utilizing multi-level thresholds to accurately assess controller status. Switch migration operations are utilized to achieve load balancing, considering factors such as the degree of load imbalance of the target controller and migration efficiency. This includes evaluating the post-migration status of the target controller and the distance between the migrating switch and the target controller to select the appropriate target controller and migrating switch. The proposed scheme reduces controller response time, migration costs, communication overhead, and throughput rate. Results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms others regarding response time and overall performance.</description>

      <title>An Extensible Software Transport Layer for GPU Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-evolving machine learning (ML) workloads have increasing requirements for networking. However, host network transport on RDMA NICs is hard to evolve, causing problems for ML workloads. For example, single-path RDMA traffic is prone to flow collisions that severely degrade collective communication performance. We present UCCL, an extensible software transport layer to evolve GPU networking. UCCL decouples the data path and control path of existing RDMA NICs and efficiently runs the control-path transport on host CPUs. This software extensibility brings in transport innovations that cannot be achieved in hardware for ML workloads, e.g., a multipath transport to resolve flow collisions. ML collectives atop UCCL achieve up to 3.3x higher performance compared to an industry solution.</description>

      <title>An All-Optical Metro Network Architecture and QoS-Aware Wavelength Allocation Study for Converged Fixed, Mobile, and Edge Computing Multi-Granular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an all-optical metro network architecture, called MOON, to serve converged multigranular traffic from fixed, mobile, and edge computing services. Since traffic is characterized by high dynamicity and diverse access requirements, MOON uses network slicing to provide quality of service (QoS) aware wavelength allocation to fulfill the various applications traffic demands. MOON incorporates hybrid optical switching (HOS) combining optical circuit switching (OCS) and optical time slotted switching (OTS) capabilities that appropriately maps different traffic types to them. Specifically, the OCS network slice explicitly serves aggregated traffic of long duration and high volume, while OTS network slice serves short bursty traffic. In order to provide flexibility, separate sets of wavelengths are used for OCS and OTS traffic service, both within a metro-access network (MAN) (intra-MAN) and between different MANs (inter-MAN). We extensively study the required number of wavelengths to efficiently serve OCS and OTS traffic for intra- and inter-MAN communication scenarios, taking into account their specific traffic access requirements in an effort to optimize wavelengths utilization. In our study, we assume nonblocking OCS communication for immediate access; therefore the number of required OCS wavelengths depends only on the number of nodes, while the number of required OTS wavelengths to obtain a desired QoS and latency level is independent from the number for OCS wavelengths. Simulation results show that within an OTS intra-MAN we achieve end-to-end (E2E) latency in submilliseconds scale, suitable for dynamic bursty traffic, while it is an decreasing function of the number of used OTS wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Mitigating xApp conflicts for efficient network slicing in 6G O-RAN: a graph convolutional-based attention network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-RAN (Open-Radio Access Network) offers a flexible, open architecture for next-generation wireless networks. Network slicing within O-RAN allows network operators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the specific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing these slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized software applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In network slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network slice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these xApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely can lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper, we address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN. Our approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable xApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant manual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based attention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead and improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL, where all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The findings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number of xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for optimal network slicing management in O-RAN.</description>

      <title>STGen: A Novel Lightweight IoT Testbed for Generating Sensor Traffic for the Experimentation of IoT Protocol and its Application in Hybrid Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network that does not rely on a fixed infrastructure and consists of numerous sensors, such as temperature, humidity, GPS, and cameras, equipped with onboard processors that manage and monitor the environment in a specific area. As a result, building a real sensor network testbed for verifying, validating, or experimenting with a newly designed protocol presents considerable challenges in adapting a laboratory scenario due to the significant financial and logistical barriers, such as the need for specialized hardware and large-scale deployments. Additionally, WSN suffers from severe constraints such as restricted power supply, short communication range, limited bandwidth availability, and restricted memory storage. Addressing these challenges, this work presents a flexible testbed solution named STGen that enables researchers to experiment with IoT protocols in a hybrid environment that emulates WSN implementations with the physical Internet through a dedicated physical server named STGen core, which receives sensor traffic and processes it for further actions. The STGen testbed is lightweight in memory usage and easy to deploy. Most importantly, STGen supports large-scale distributed systems, facilitates experimentation with IoT protocols, and enables integration with back-end services for big data analytics and statistical insights. The key feature of STGen is the integration of real-world IoT protocols and their applications with WSN. Its modular and lightweight design makes STGen efficient and enables it to outperform other popular testbeds, such as Gotham and GothX, reducing memory usage by 89\%. While GothX takes approximately 26 minutes to establish a large topology with four VM nodes and 498 Docker nodes, STGen requires only 1.645 seconds to initialize the platform with 500 sensor nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Technologies for Beyond 5G and 6G Networks: Applications, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the world prepares for the advent of 6G networks, quantum technologies are becoming critical enablers of the next generation of communication systems. This survey paper investigates the convergence of quantum technologies and 6G networks, focusing on their applications, opportunities and challenges. We begin with an examination of the motivations for integrating quantum technologies into 6G, investigating the potential to overcome the limits of classical computing and cryptography. We then highlight key research gaps, particularly in quantum communication, quantum computing integration and security enhancement. A comprehensive overview of quantum technologies relevant to 6G, including quantum communication devices, quantum computing paradigms, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches is provided. A particular focus is on the role of quantum technologies in enhancing 6G Radio Access Networks (RAN), 6G core and edge network optimization, and 6G security. The survey paper also explores the application of quantum cryptography with a focus on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) and quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and assesses their implementation challenges and potential impact on 6G networks. We also discuss the significant challenges associated with integrating quantum technologies into existing communications infrastructures, including issues of technological maturity, standardization, and economic considerations. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from current research and outline future research directions to guide the ongoing development of quantum-enabled 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Honeybee: Byzantine Tolerant Decentralized Peer Sampling with Verifiable Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popular blockchains today have hundreds of thousands of nodes and need to be able to support sophisticated scaling solutions$\unicode{x2013}$such as sharding, data availability sampling, and layer-2 methods. Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\geq50\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of BLE Broadcast Mode in Offline Finding Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Offline Finding Network(OFN), offline Bluetooth tags broadcast to the surrounding area, the finder devices receiving the broadcast signal and upload location information to the IoT(Internet of Things) cloud servers, thereby achieving offline finding of lost items. This process is essentially a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) neighbor discovery process(NDP). In the process, the variety of Bluetooth scan modes caused by the scan interval and scan window settings affects the discovery latency of finder devices finding the tag broadcast packets. To optimize the experience of searching for lost devices, we propose the CPBIS-mechanism, a certain proportion broadcast-intervals screening mechanism that calculates the most suitable two broadcast intervals and their proportion for offline tags. This reduces discovery latency in the BLE NDP, improves the discovery success rate, further enhances the user experience. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a comprehensive solution for configuring the broadcast interval parameters of advertisers in BLE NDP, particularly for configurations involving two or more broadcast intervals. We evaluated the results obtained by CPBIS on the nRF52832 chip. The data shows that the CPBIS-mechanism achieves relatively low discovery latencies for multiple scan modes.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</description>
