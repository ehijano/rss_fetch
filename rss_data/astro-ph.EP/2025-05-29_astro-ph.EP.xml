      <title>Exocomets of $\beta$ Pictoris I: Exocomet destruction, sodium and disk line variability in 17 years of HARPS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young $\beta$ Pictoris system has been monitored with high-resolution optical spectrographs for decades. These observations have revealed strongly variable absorption in the Ca II H\&amp;K lines attributed to in-falling cometary bodies. Since 2003, over 9000 HARPS observations of $\beta$ Pictoris have been taken and many of these have not yet been used for exocomet studies. We search these spectra for new exocomet phenomenology enabled by the long time coverage and large volume of this dataset. We systematically carry out telluric correction of the HARPS spectra using molecfit, compare multi-year observations of the Ca II and Na I lines and use a Bayesian fitting algorithm to extract exocomet line parameters. We explore the usage of an unbiased reference spectrum with which to calibrate the continuum, and investigate Keplerian orbital solutions to observed exocomet acceleration. We find a general absence of exocometary sodium line absorption, with only two instances of clear ($\sim 2$ % deep) exocometary sodium out of 198 nights of observation, as well as a weaker ($\sim 1$ %) feature that persists over 13 nights in 2004. We find that these events occur during times of deep Ca II absorption at the same red-shift, implying that strongly Ca II-evaporating exocomets also exhibit detectable levels of Na I, in spite of the vast majority of Na I being rapidly photo-ionised in close proximity to the star. We find long-lived Ca II absorption in 2017 and 2018 that persists on a timescale of a year, which may be difficult to explain with the classical exocomet model. Finally, we investigate two strongly accelerating, blue-shifted exocomes observed in 2019 that show strong and sudden departures from Keplerian motion, suggesting rapid changes to the dynamics of the exocomet cloud. We hypothesize that this is caused by the destruction of the comet nuclei shortly after their periastron passages.</description>

      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21810v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>

      <title>Libration of Pluto's argument of perihelion and the role of the major planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pluto's argument of perihelion is known to librate around $90^\circ$. This libration is related to the secular phenomenon known as the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) oscillation. In this work, we make a quantitative assessment of the influence of Neptune's mean motion resonance and of the other giant planets' secular perturbations on the libration of Pluto's argument of perihelion. Here, a parameter $k^2 = (1-e^2) \cos^2 I$ is the key where $e$ is eccentricity and $I$ is inclination. When $k^2$ of a Pluto-like object is larger than a certain critical value, libration of its argument of perihelion would not occur. The secular effect of other disturbing planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus) plays a significant role in determining the critical $k^2$. The non-zero oscillation amplitude of the critical resonant argument also plays a role, although not a dominant one.</description>

      <title>Hidden Transits: TOI-2285 b is a Warmer sub-Neptune Likely with a Super-Earth Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-2285 b is a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting a nearby M dwarf, discovered through the TESS photometric survey and ground-based follow-up observations. The planet was initially reported to have an orbital period of 27.27 d, making it one of the lowest temperature sub-Neptunes transiting a bright M dwarf. However, additional TESS data reveal that its true orbital period is 13.64 d, half the original value, resulting in a warmer equilibrium temperature (358 K) than previously estimated (284 K). The misidentification likely resulted from the low signal-to-noise ratio of individual transit signals and the limited number of transits observed by TESS at that time. This case highlights the importance of carefully considering harmonic solutions for similar cases. The additional TESS data also reveal another planetary candidate with an orbital period of 9.67 d and a radius of 1.5 $R_\oplus$, requiring validation in future studies.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey III: A deep eclipse for LHS 1140c and a new Gaussian process method to account for correlated noise in individual pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths is becoming a common technique to search for atmospheres around rocky exoplanets. This method constrains the brightness temperature of the planet to determine whether heat redistribution is taking place - indicative of an atmosphere - or whether the heat is reradiated from a low albedo bare rock. By observing at 15$\mu$m we are also highly sensitive to CO$_2$ absorption. We observed three eclipses of the rocky super-Earth LHS 1140c using MIRI/Imaging with the F1500W filter. We found significant variation in the initial settling ramp for these observations and identify a potential trend between detector settling and the previous filter used by MIRI. We analysed our data using aperture photometry but also developed a novel approach which joint-fits pixel light curves directly using a shared eclipse model and a flexible multi-dimensional Gaussian process which models changes in the PSF over time. We demonstrate using simulated data that our method has the ability to weight away from particular pixels which show increased systematics, allowing for the recovery of eclipse depths in a more robust and precise way. Both methods and an independent analysis detect the eclipse at $&gt;5\sigma$ and are highly consistent with a low albedo bare rock. We recover a dayside brightness temperature of $T_\mathrm{day} = 561\pm44$ K, close to the theoretical maximum of $T_\text{day; max} = 537\pm9$ K. We rule out a wide range of atmospheric forward models to $&gt;3\sigma$ including pure CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge10$ mbar and pure H$_2$O atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge1$ bar. Our strict constraints on potential atmospheric composition, in combination with future observations of the exciting outer planet LHS 1140b, could provide a powerful benchmark to understand atmospheric escape around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>

      <title>ExoPhoto: A Database of Temperature-Dependent Photodissociation Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ExoPhoto database (https://exomol.com/exophoto/), an extension of the ExoMol database, specifically developed to address the growing need for high-accuracy, temperature-dependent photodissociation cross section data towards short-UV wavelengths. ExoPhoto combines theoretical models from three major computational databases (ExoMol, UGAMOP and PhoMol) and experimental datasets from two experimental groups, providing extensive wavelength and temperature coverage. ExoPhoto currently includes photodissociation data for 20 molecules: AlH, HCl, HF, MgH, OH, NaO, MgO, O2, AlCl, AlF, CS, HeH+, CO, CO2, H2O, SO2, C2H2, C2H4, H2CO, and NH3, derived from theoretical models and supported by experimental data from 5 databases.
  ExoPhoto also includes detailed data on branching ratios and quantum yields for selected datasets. The data structure of ExoPhoto follows the ExoMol framework, with a consistent naming convention and hierarchical JSON-based organization. Photodissociation cross sections are stored in a set of .photo files which provide data as a function of wavelength with one file for each target molecule temperature. Future developments aim to include more photodissociation cross section data and to provide data for molecules in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). These will expand the utility of ExoPhoto for advanced astrophysical, planetary modeling and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Li abundances of Stars with and without Detected Planets from the High Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the presence of planets affects the lithium (Li) abundance of their host stars is still an open question. To investigate the difference of the Li abundance between planet-host stars (HS) and isolated stars (IS) with no detected planets, we analyze a large sample of stars with temperatures ranging from 4600 to 6600 K and metallicity ranging from -0.55 to +0.50. The sample consists of 279 HS whose spectra were taken from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS), which followed up planets detected by Kepler, and 171 IS whose spectra were taken from the Keck archive. The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects were taken into consideration. It is found that the distribution of Li abundances in both the HS and IS groups are generally consistent with each other. This suggests that the presence of Kepler-like planets does not have a significant impact on Li depletion. We also found that the non-LTE corrections can not be neglected for stars with A(Li) over ~ 2.5 dex.</description>

      <title>The peculiar composition of the Sun is not related to giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly-differential spectroscopic studies have revealed that the Sun is deficient in refractory elements relative to solar twins. To investigate the role of giant planets on this signature, we present a high precision abundance analysis of HARPS spectra for 50 F- and G-type stars spanning -0.4&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;+0.5. There are 29 stars in the sample which host planets of masses &gt; 0.01 MJup. We derive abundances for 19 elements, and apply corrections to 14 of them for systematic errors associated with one dimensional (1D) model atmospheres, or the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), or both. We find that, among the solar twins in our sample, the Sun is Li poor in comparison to other stars at similar age, in agreement to previous studies. The sample shows a variety of trends in elemental abundances as a function of condensation temperature. We find a strong correlation in these trends with [Fe/H], with a marginally-significant difference in the gradients for stars with and without giants planets detected, that increases after applying 3D and non-LTE corrections. Our overall results suggests that the peculiar composition of the Sun is primarily related to Galactic chemical evolution rather than the presence of giant planets.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>Coverage Biases in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite imagery is increasingly used to complement traditional data collection approaches such as surveys and censuses across scientific disciplines. However, we ask: Do all places on earth benefit equally from this new wealth of information? In this study, we investigate coverage bias of major satellite constellations that provide optical satellite imagery with a ground sampling distance below 10 meters, evaluating both the future on-demand tasking opportunities as well as the availability of historic images across the globe. Specifically, forward-looking, we estimate how often different places are revisited during a window of 30 days based on the satellites' orbital paths, thus investigating potential coverage biases caused by physical factors. We find that locations farther away from the equator are generally revisited more frequently by the constellations under study. Backward-looking, we show that historic satellite image availability -- based on metadata collected from major satellite imagery providers -- is influenced by socio-economic factors on the ground: less developed, less populated places have less satellite images available. Furthermore, in three small case studies on recent conflict regions in this world, namely Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, we show that also geopolitical events play an important role in satellite image availability, hinting at underlying business model decisions. These insights lay bare that the digital dividend yielded by satellite imagery is not equally distributed across our planet.</description>
