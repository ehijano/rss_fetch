      <title>Polynomial mixing for the white-forced wave equation on the whole line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of the white-forced wave equation on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we prove the uniqueness of stationary measure and polynomial mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The difficulties in our proof are twofold. On the one hand, compared to stochastic parabolic equation, stochastic wave equation is lack of smoothing effect and strongly dissipative mechanism. On the other hand, the whole line leads to the lack of compactness compared to bounded domain. In order to overcome the above difficulties, our proof is based on a new criterion for polynomial mixing established in [20], a new weight type Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of wave equation on the whole line and weight energy estimates for stochastic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra Systems and Complex Balanced Polyexponential Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global stability of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with generalized polynomial right-hand side, without restrictions on the number of variables or the polynomial degree, including negative and non-integer degree. We introduce polyexponential dynamical systems, which are equivalent to the generalized Lotka-Volterra systems, and we use an analogy to the theory of mass-action kinetics to define and analyze complex balanced polyexponential systems, and implicitly analyze complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. We prove that complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems have globally attracting states, up to standard conservation relations, which become linear for the associated polyexponential systems. In particular, complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems cannot give rise to periodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, or other complex dynamical behaviors. We describe a simple sufficient condition for complex balance in terms of an associated graph structure, and we use it to analyze specific examples.</description>

      <title>Iterated relation systems on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fractals on Riemannian manifolds, the theory of iterated function systems often does not apply well directly, as fractal sets are often defined by relations that are multivalued or non-contractive. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the notion of iterated relation systems. We study the attractor of an iterated relation system and formulate a condition under which such an attractor can be identified with that of an associated graph-directed iterated function system. Using this method, we obtain dimension formulas for the attractor of an iterated relation system under the graph open set condition or the graph finite type condition. This method improves the one in [Ngai-Xu, J. Geom. Anal. {\bf 33} (2023), 262], which relies on knowing the specific structure of the attractor.</description>

      <title>On the parameter space of fibered hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of quasiconformal (QC) surgery for holomorphic maps fibered over an irrational rotation of the unit circle, also known as quasiperiodically forced (QPF) maps. It consists of modifying the fibered multiplier of an attracting invariant curve for a QPF hyperbolic polynomial. This is the analogue of the classical change of multiplier of an attracting cycle in the one-dimensional iteration case, to parametrize hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set.
  Our goal is to show that, for a family of QPF quadratic maps with Diophantine frequency, the fibered multiplier map associated to its unique attracting invariant curve, as a complex counterpart of the Lyapunov exponent, is a holomorphic submersion on a complex Banach manifold.</description>

      <title>Gap Labels and Asymptotic Gap Opening for Full Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss gap labelling for operators generated by the full shift over a compact subset of the real line. The set of Johnson--Schwartzman gap labels is the algebra generated by weights of clopen subsets of the support of the single-site distribution. Due to the presence of a dense set of periodic orbits, it is impossible to find a sampling function for which all gaps allowed by the gap labelling theorem open simultaneously. Nevertheless, for a suitable choice of the single-site distribution, we show that for generic sampling functions, every spectral gap opens in the large-coupling limit. Furthermore, we show that for other choices of weights there are gaps that cannot open for purely diagonal operators.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Embedding Approach for Dynamics Modeling of Parallel Kinematic Manipulators with Hybrid Limbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are characterized by closed kinematic loops, due to the parallel arrangement of limbs but also due to the existence of kinematic loops within the limbs. Moreover, many PKM are built with limbs constructed by serially combining kinematic loops. Such limbs are called hybrid, which form a particular class of complex limbs. Design and model-based control requires accurate dynamic PKM models desirably without model simplifications. Dynamics modeling then necessitates kinematic relations of all members of the PKM, in contrast to the standard kinematics modeling of PKM, where only the forward and inverse kinematics solution for the manipulator (relating input and output motions) are computed. This becomes more involved for PKM with hybrid limbs. In this paper a modular modeling approach is employed, where limbs are treated separately, and the individual dynamic equations of motions (EOM) are subsequently assembled to the overall model. Key to the kinematic modeling is the constraint resolution for the individual loops within the limbs. This local constraint resolution is a special case of the general \emph{constraint embedding} technique. The proposed method finally allows for a systematic modeling of general PKM. The method is demonstrated for the IRSBot-2, where each limb comprises two independent loops.</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last twenty years, Lewis Bowen's sofic entropy and its annealed version (originally called the `f-invariant') have taken a central place in the ergodic theory of actions of non-amenable groups. In this work we pursue these notions of entropy across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. We find connections to both classical constructs in operator theory and the study of tuples of independent random unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>Minimum nonlinearity for pattern-forming Turing instability in a mathematical autocatalytic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature and the mechanism widely-accepted to underlay them is based on the Turing instability, predicted by Alan Turing decades ago. This is a non-trivial mechanism that involves nonlinear interaction terms between the different species involved and transport mechanisms. We present here a mathematical analysis aiming to explore the mathematical constraints that a reaction-diffusion dynamical model should comply in order to exhibit a Turing instability. The main conclusion limits the existence of this instability to nonlinearity degrees larger or equal to three.</description>

      <title>Joint ergodicity for commuting transformations and applications to polynomial sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for joint ergodicity results of collections of sequences with respect to systems of commuting measure preserving transformations. Combining these results with a new technique that we call "seminorm smoothening", we settle several conjectures related to multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations with polynomial iterates. We show that the Host-Kra factor is characteristic for pairwise independent polynomials, and that under certain ergodicity conditions the associated ergodic averages converge to the product of integrals. Moreover, when the polynomials are linearly independent, we show that the rational Kronecker factor is characteristic and deduce Khintchine-type lower bounds for the related multiple recurrence problem. Finally, we prove a nil plus null decomposition result for multiple correlation sequences of commuting transformations in the case where the iterates are given by families of pairwise independent polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the study of holomorphic correspondences as dynamical systems that can display behaviors of both rational maps and Kleinian groups has gained a good amount of attention. This phenomenon is related to the Sullivan dictionary, a list of parallels between the theories of these two systems. We build upon a surgical construction of such matings, due to Bullett and Harvey, increasing the degree of maps we consider, and proving regularity properties of the mating map on parameter spaces: namely, analyticity on the interior of its domain of definition, and continuity under quasiconformal rigidity on the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber resilience is the ability of a system to resist and recover from a cyber attack, thereby restoring the system's functionality. Effective design and development of a cyber resilient system requires experimental methods and tools for quantitative measuring of cyber resilience. This paper describes an experimental method and test bed for obtaining resilience-relevant data as a system (in our case -- a truck) traverses its route, in repeatable, systematic experiments. We model a truck equipped with an autonomous cyber-defense system and which also includes inherent physical resilience features. When attacked by malware, this ensemble of cyber-physical features (i.e., "bonware") strives to resist and recover from the performance degradation caused by the malware's attack. We propose parsimonious mathematical models to aid in quantifying systems' resilience to cyber attacks. Using the models, we identify quantitative characteristics obtainable from experimental data, and show that these characteristics can serve as useful quantitative measures of cyber resilience.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Delay Differential Equations with Discrete Delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework is a robust method for identifying governing equations, successfully applied to ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. In this work we extend SINDy to identify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that includes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly unknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates. The resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably reducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach. We also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and (non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential equations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and parameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages. As a consequence, the class of discoverable models is significantly expanded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>
