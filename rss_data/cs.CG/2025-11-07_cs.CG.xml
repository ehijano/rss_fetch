      <title>Vectorized Computation of Euler Characteristic Functions and Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications. However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Lower Bounds for the Maximum Overlap of Two Polygons Under Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in shape matching and geometric similarity is computing the maximum area overlap between two polygons under translation. For general simple polygons, the best-known algorithm runs in $O((nm)^2 \log(nm))$ time [Mount, Silverman, Wu 96], where $n$ and $m$ are the complexities of the input polygons. In a recent breakthrough, Chan and Hair gave a linear-time algorithm for the special case when both polygons are convex. A key challenge in computational geometry is to design improved algorithms for other natural classes of polygons. We address this by presenting an $O((nm)^{3/2} \log(nm))$-time algorithm for the case when both polygons are orthogonal. This is the first algorithm for polygon overlap on orthogonal polygons that is faster than the almost 30 years old algorithm for simple polygons.
  Complementing our algorithmic contribution, we provide $k$-SUM lower bounds for problems on simple polygons with only orthogonal and diagonal edges. First, we establish that there is no algorithm for polygon overlap with running time $O(\max(n^2,nm^2)^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $m\leq n$, unless the $k$-SUM hypothesis fails. This matches the running time of our algorithm when $n=m$. We use part of the above construction to also show a lower bound for the polygon containment problem, a popular special case of the overlap problem. Concretely, there is no algorithm for polygon containment with running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ under the $3$-SUM hypothesis, even when the polygon to be contained has $m=O(1)$ vertices. Our lower bound shows that polygon containment for these types of polygons (i.e., with diagonal edges) is strictly harder than for orthogonal polygons, and also strengthens the previously known lower bounds for polygon containment. Furthermore, our lower bounds show tightness of the algorithm of [Mount, Silverman, Wu 96] when $m=O(1)$.</description>
