      <title>Pacer and Runner: Cooperative Learning Framework between Single- and Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) improves recommendation performance by utilizing information from multiple domains, which contrasts with Single-Domain Sequential Recommendation (SDSR) that relies on a historical interaction within a specific domain. However, CDSR may underperform compared to the SDSR approach in certain domains due to negative transfer, which occurs when there is a lack of relation between domains or different levels of data sparsity. To address the issue of negative transfer, our proposed CDSR model estimates the degree of negative transfer of each domain and adaptively assigns it as a weight factor to the prediction loss, to control gradient flows through domains with significant negative transfer. To this end, our model compares the performance of a model trained on multiple domains (CDSR) with a model trained solely on the specific domain (SDSR) to evaluate the negative transfer of each domain using our asymmetric cooperative network. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of valuable cues between the SDSR and CDSR tasks, we developed an auxiliary loss that maximizes the mutual information between the representation pairs from both tasks on a per-domain basis. This cooperative learning between SDSR and CDSR tasks is similar to the collaborative dynamics between pacers and runners in a marathon. Our model outperformed numerous previous works in extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets across ten service domains. We also have deployed our model in the recommendation system of our personal assistant app service, resulting in 21.4% increase in click-through rate compared to existing models, which is valuable to real-world business.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Pre-training with Dynamic Identifier Prediction for Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval uses differentiable search indexes to directly generate relevant document identifiers in response to a query. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of a strong generative retrieval model, trained with carefully crafted pre-training tasks, to enhance downstream retrieval tasks via fine-tuning. However, the full power of pre-training for generative retrieval remains underexploited due to its reliance on pre-defined static document identifiers, which may not align with evolving model parameters. In this work, we introduce BootRet, a bootstrapped pre-training method for generative retrieval that dynamically adjusts document identifiers during pre-training to accommodate the continuing memorization of the corpus. BootRet involves three key training phases: (i) initial identifier generation, (ii) pre-training via corpus indexing and relevance prediction tasks, and (iii) bootstrapping for identifier updates. To facilitate the pre-training phase, we further introduce noisy documents and pseudo-queries, generated by large language models, to resemble semantic connections in both indexing and retrieval tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BootRet significantly outperforms existing pre-training generative retrieval baselines and performs well even in zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>A PLMs based protein retrieval framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein retrieval, which targets the deconstruction of the relationship between sequences, structures and functions, empowers the advancing of biology. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), a sequence-similarity-based algorithm, has proved the efficiency of this field. Despite the existing tools for protein retrieval, they prioritize sequence similarity and probably overlook proteins that are dissimilar but share homology or functionality. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel protein retrieval framework that mitigates the bias towards sequence similarity. Our framework initiatively harnesses protein language models (PLMs) to embed protein sequences within a high-dimensional feature space, thereby enhancing the representation capacity for subsequent analysis. Subsequently, an accelerated indexed vector database is constructed to facilitate expedited access and retrieval of dense vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can equally retrieve both similar and dissimilar proteins. Moreover, this approach enables the identification of proteins that conventional methods fail to uncover. This framework will effectively assist in protein mining and empower the development of biology.</description>

      <title>Interactions with Generative Information Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At its core, information access and seeking is an interactive process. In existing search engines, interactions are limited to a few pre-defined actions, such as "requery", "click on a document", "scrolling up/down", "going to the next result page", "leaving the search engine", etc. A major benefit of moving towards generative IR systems is enabling users with a richer expression of information need and feedback and free-form interactions in natural language and beyond. In other words, the actions users take are no longer limited by the clickable links and buttons available on the search engine result page and users can express themselves freely through natural language. This can go even beyond natural language, through images, videos, gestures, and sensors using multi-modal generative IR systems. This chapter briefly discusses the role of interaction in generative IR systems. We will first discuss different ways users can express their information needs by interacting with generative IR systems. We then explain how users can provide explicit or implicit feedback to generative IR systems and how they can consume such feedback. Next, we will cover how users interactively can refine retrieval results. We will expand upon mixed-initiative interactions and discuss clarification and preference elicitation in more detail. We then discuss proactive generative IR systems, including context-aware recommendation, following up past conversations, contributing to multi-party conversations, and feedback requests. Providing explanation is another interaction type that we briefly discuss in this chapter. We will also briefly describe multi-modal interactions in generative information retrieval. Finally, we describe emerging frameworks and solutions for user interfaces with generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Models for Multimodal Product Bundling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product bundling provides clients with a strategic combination of individual items.And it has gained significant attention in recent years as a fundamental prerequisite for online services. Recent methods utilize multimodal information through sophisticated extractors for bundling, but remain limited by inferior semantic understanding, the restricted scope of knowledge, and an inability to handle cold-start issues.Despite the extensive knowledge and complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their direct utilization fails to process multimodalities and exploit their knowledge for multimodal product bundling. Adapting LLMs for this purpose involves demonstrating the synergies among different modalities and designing an effective optimization strategy for bundling, which remains challenging.To this end, we introduce Bundle-LLM to bridge the gap between LLMs and product bundling tasks. Sepcifically, we utilize a hybrid item tokenization to integrate multimodal information, where a simple yet powerful multimodal fusion module followed by a trainable projector embeds all non-textual features into a single token. This module not only explicitly exhibits the interplays among modalities but also shortens the prompt length, thereby boosting efficiency.By designing a prompt template, we formulate product bundling as a multiple-choice question given candidate items. Furthermore, we adopt progressive optimization strategy to fine-tune the LLMs for disentangled objectives, achieving effective product bundling capability with comprehensive multimodal semantic understanding.Extensive experiments on four datasets from two application domains show that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>EndoFinder: Online Image Retrieval for Explainable Colorectal Polyp Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the necessity of resecting malignant polyps during colonoscopy screen is crucial for patient outcomes, yet challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of histopathology examination. While deep learning-based classification models have shown promise in achieving optical biopsy with endoscopic images, they often suffer from a lack of explainability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EndoFinder, a content-based image retrieval framework to find the 'digital twin' polyp in the reference database given a newly detected polyp. The clinical semantics of the new polyp can be inferred referring to the matched ones. EndoFinder pioneers a polyp-aware image encoder that is pre-trained on a large polyp dataset in a self-supervised way, merging masked image modeling with contrastive learning. This results in a generic embedding space ready for different downstream clinical tasks based on image retrieval. We validate the framework on polyp re-identification and optical biopsy tasks, with extensive experiments demonstrating that EndoFinder not only achieves explainable diagnostics but also matches the performance of supervised classification models. EndoFinder's reliance on image retrieval has the potential to support diverse downstream decision-making tasks during real-time colonoscopy procedures.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.</description>

      <title>AutoSAM: Towards Automatic Sampling of User Behaviors for Sequential Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRS) have gained widespread popularity in recommendation due to their ability to effectively capture dynamic user preferences. One default setting in the current SRS is to uniformly consider each historical behavior as a positive interaction. Actually, this setting has the potential to yield sub-optimal performance, as each item makes a distinct contribution to the user's interest. For example, purchased items should be given more importance than clicked ones. Hence, we propose a general automatic sampling framework, named AutoSAM, to non-uniformly treat historical behaviors. Specifically, AutoSAM augments the standard sequential recommendation architecture with an additional sampler layer to adaptively learn the skew distribution of the raw input, and then sample informative sub-sets to build more generalizable SRS. To overcome the challenges of non-differentiable sampling actions and also introduce multiple decision factors for sampling, we further introduce a novel reinforcement learning based method to guide the training of the sampler. We theoretically design multi-objective sampling rewards including Future Prediction and Sequence Perplexity, and then optimize the whole framework in an end-to-end manner by combining the policy gradient. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark recommender models and four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We will make our code publicly available after the acceptance.</description>

      <title>SciConNav: Knowledge navigation through contextual learning of extensive scientific research trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New knowledge builds upon existing foundations, which means an interdependent relationship exists between knowledge, manifested in the historical development of the scientific system for hundreds of years. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</description>

Abstract: Robust access to trustworthy information is a critical need for society with implications for knowledge production, public health education, and promoting informed citizenry in democratic societies. Generative AI technologies may enable new ways to access information and improve effectiveness of existing information retrieval systems but we are only starting to understand and grapple with their long-term social implications. In this chapter, we present an overview of some of the systemic consequences and risks of employing generative AI in the context of information access.

      <title>UniRec: A Dual Enhancement of Uniformity and Frequency in Sequential Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation learning in sequential recommendation is critical for accurately modeling user interaction patterns and improving recommendation precision. However, existing approaches predominantly emphasize item-to-item transitions, often neglecting the time intervals between interactions, which are closely related to behavior pattern changes. Additionally, broader interaction attributes, such as item frequency, are frequently overlooked. We found that both sequences with more uniform time intervals and items with higher frequency yield better prediction performance. Conversely, non-uniform sequences exacerbate user interest drift and less-frequent items are difficult to model due to sparse sampling, presenting unique challenges inadequately addressed by current methods. In this paper, we propose UniRec, a novel bidirectional enhancement sequential recommendation method. UniRec leverages sequence uniformity and item frequency to enhance performance, particularly improving the representation of non-uniform sequences and less-frequent items. These two branches mutually reinforce each other, driving comprehensive performance optimization in complex sequential recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we present a multidimensional time module to further enhance adaptability. To the best of our knowledge, UniRec is the first method to utilize the characteristics of uniformity and frequency for feature augmentation. Comparing with eleven advanced models across four datasets, we demonstrate that UniRec outperforms SOTA models significantly.

      <description>arXiv:2303.11916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based model, CompoDiff, for solving zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) with latent diffusion. This paper also introduces a new synthetic dataset, named SynthTriplets18M, with 18.8 million reference images, conditions, and corresponding target image triplets to train CIR models. CompoDiff and SynthTriplets18M tackle the shortages of the previous CIR approaches, such as poor generalizability due to the small dataset scale and the limited types of conditions. CompoDiff not only achieves a new state-of-the-art on four ZS-CIR benchmarks, including FashionIQ, CIRR, CIRCO, and GeneCIS, but also enables a more versatile and controllable CIR by accepting various conditions, such as negative text, and image mask conditions. CompoDiff also shows the controllability of the condition strength between text and image queries and the trade-off between inference speed and performance, which are unavailable with existing CIR methods. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/navervision/CompoDiff</description>

      <title>Evaluating Concurrent Robustness of Language Models Across Diverse Challenge Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models, characterized by their black-box nature, often hallucinate and display sensitivity to input perturbations, causing concerns about trust. To enhance trust, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model's failure modes and develop effective strategies to improve their performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology designed to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance the model's robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation enhances or diminishes the model's performance with respect to other perturbations. To address robustness against multiple perturbations, we present three distinct fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of our methodology to encompass large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach augmented with exemplars. We employ the Tabular-NLI task to showcase how our proposed strategies adeptly train a robust model, enabling it to address diverse perturbations while maintaining accuracy on the original dataset.</description>

      <title>Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.</description>
