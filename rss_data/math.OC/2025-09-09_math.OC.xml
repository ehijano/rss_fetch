      <title>Convergence analysis for pseudo-monotone variational inequality problem involving projections onto a moving ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an iterative scheme that converges to the solution of a pseudo-monotone variational inequality problem in the setting of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Traditional methods often require projections onto the feasible set $\mathfrak{C}$ or onto a half-space containing $\mathfrak{C}$. However, computing projections onto a complicated feasible set can be difficult, and projections onto a half-space may fall outside $\mathfrak{C}$. Keeping this in mind, we aim to develop an iterative scheme that projects onto a ball that is contained in a feasible set and has an explicit expression. Our iterative scheme does not require prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the cost operator. Finally, we provide some numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fair Risk Optimization of Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper provides a framework for the assessment and optimization of the total risk of complex distributed systems. The framework takes into account the risk of each agent, which may arise from heterogeneous sources, as well as the risk associated with the efficient operation of the system as a whole.
  The challenges posed by this task are associated with the lack of additivity of risk, the need to evaluate the risk of every agent (unit) using confidential or proprietary information, and the requirement of fair risk allocation to agents (units).
  We analyze systemic risk measures that are based on a sound axiomatic foundation while at the same time facilitate risk-averse sequential decision-making by distributed numerical methods, which allow the agents to operate autonomously with minimal exchange of information.
  We formulate a two-stage decision problem for a distributed system using systemic measures of risk and devise a decomposition method for solving the problem. The method is applied to a disaster management problem. We have paid attention to maintain fair risk allocation to all areas in the course of the relief operation. Our numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of stochastic dominance constraints via optimal mass transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems with stochastic dominance constraints provide a possibility to shape risk by selecting a benchmark random outcome with a desired distribution. The comparison of the relevant random outcomes to the respective benchmarks requires functional inequalities between the distribution functions or their transforms. A difficulty arises when no feasible decision results in a distribution that dominates the benchmark. Our paper addresses the problem of choosing a tight relaxation of the stochastic dominance constraint by selecting a feasible distribution, which is closest to those dominating the benchmark in terms of mass transportation distance. For the second-order stochastic dominance in a standard atomless space, we obtain new explicit formulae for the Monge-Kantorovich transportation distance of a given distribution to the set of dominating distributions. We use our results to construct a numerical method for solving the relaxation problem. Under an additional assumption, we also construct the associated projection of the distribution of interest onto the set of distributions dominating the benchmark. For the stochastic dominance relations of order $r\in[1,\infty)$, we show a lower bound for the relevant mass transportation distance. Our numerical experience illustrates the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Globalized Semismooth Newton Method for Prox-regular Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth composite optimization problems, comprising a twice differentiable function and a prox-regular function. We establish a sufficient condition for the proximal mapping of a prox-regular function to be single-valued and locally Lipschitz continuous. By virtue of this property, we propose a hybrid of proximal gradient and semismooth Newton methods for solving these composite optimization problems, which is a globalized semismooth Newton method. The whole sequence is shown to converge to an $L$-stationary point under a Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz exponent assumption. Under an additional error bound condition and some other mild conditions, we prove that the sequence converges to a nonisolated $L$-stationary point at a superlinear convergence rate. Numerical comparison with several existing second order methods reveal that our approach performs comparably well in solving both the $\ell_q(0&lt;q&lt;1)$ quasi-norm regularized problems and the fused zero-norm regularization problems.</description>

      <title>rDSM -- A robust Downhill Simplex Method software package for optimization problems in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Downhill Simplex Method (DSM) is a fast-converging derivative-free optimization technique for nonlinear systems. However, the optimization process is often subject to premature convergence due to degenerated simplices or noise-induced spurious minima. This study introduces a software package for the robust Downhill Simplex Method (rDSM), which incorporates two key enhancements. First, simplex degeneracy is detected and corrected by volume maximization under constraints. Second, the real objective value of noisy problems is estimated by reevaluating the long-standing points. Thus, rDSM improves the convergence of DSM, and may increase the applicability of DSM to higher dimensions, even in the presence of noise. The rDSM software package thus provides a robust and efficient solution for both analytical and experimental optimization scenarios. This methodological advancement extends the applicability of simplex-based optimization to complex experimental systems where gradient information remains inaccessible and measurement noise proves non-negligible.</description>

      <title>What is the Best Way to Do Something? A Discreet Tour of Discrete Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical optimization, we want to find the best possible solution for a decision-making problem. Curiously, these problems are harder to solve if they have discrete decisions. Imagine that you would like to buy chocolate: you can buy no chocolate or one chocolate bar, but typically you cannot buy just half of a bar. Now imagine that you could also buy many other items, and that you need to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the grocery bill. With more options and more demands, finding the best solution becomes trickier. But since many real-world settings benefit from mathematical optimization, such as scheduling trains and flights, planning truck deliveries, and making better investment decisions, these problems are widely studied in a branch of mathematics called Operations Research (OR). Sometimes we can simply write the mathematical model and find an optimal solution with OR software, but for larger problems we may need to develop new mathematical models and even write our own algorithms. We explore both cases with a simple and well-known problem (the traveling salesperson problem), some computer programming (in Python), and software that is free for academic use (Gurobi).</description>

      <title>Integrated charging scheduling for electric buses with time-of-use tariffs, peak power, V2G, battery ageing, and renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid electrification of city bus fleets offers significant environmental benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, it also introduces complex challenges in energy management and infrastructure planning for public transport operators (PTOs). This study develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to minimize daily operational costs for electric bus (EB) networks. The model integrates on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, while explicitly accounting for dynamic electricity tariffs, peak demand charges, and battery degradation costs. A discrete-event optimization (DEO) scheme is employed to balance computational efficiency with operational accuracy. The framework is applied to a real-world case in Brussels involving 28 articulated electric buses (EBs) and 232 trips over a 24-hour horizon. A scenario-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of the extended components. Key findings show that incorporating demand charges into the optimization reduces daily costs by 5% and decreases the share of peak power costs by 9%, underlining the importance of load management. Integrating PV and ESS leads to a total net cost reduction of up to 56%, with ESS primarily used for energy arbitrage rather than direct bus charging. V2G participation is highly sensitive to battery degradation costs and policy incentives: it can become economically viable under high tariff margins and decreased replacement costs. When all extensions are combined, the model achieves a 58% reduction in total operational expenses compared to the baseline, highlighting the substantial value of smart (dis)charging optimization tools for PTOs.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian conjugate subgradient method for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugate gradient (CG) methods are widely acknowledged as efficient for minimizing continuously differentiable functions in Euclidean spaces. In recent years, various CG methods have been extended to Riemannian manifold optimization, but existing Riemannian CG methods are confined to smooth objective functions and cannot handle nonsmooth ones. This paper proposes a Riemannian conjugate subgradient method for a class of nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problems on manifolds. Specifically, we first select a Riemannian subgradient from the convex hull of two directionally active subgradients. The search direction is then defined as a convex combination of the negative of this subgradient and the previous search direction transported to the current tangent space. Additionally, a Riemannian line search with an interval reduction procedure is integrated to generate an appropriate step size, ensuring the objective function values form a monotonically nonincreasing sequence. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments on three classes of Riemannian optimization problems show that the proposed method takes significantly less computational time than related existing methods. To our knowledge, this is the first CG-type method developed for Riemannian nonsmooth optimization.</description>

      <title>Box Allocation Optimization in Meal Kit Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Box Allocation Problem (BAP), a novel optimization challenge in the $1.4 billion UK meal kit delivery market. BAP involves assigning orders across multiple production facilities to minimize daily recipe variations while adhering to capacity and eligibility constraints over a 15-day planning horizon. We formulate BAP as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and systematically compare the performance of the COIN-OR Branch and Cut (CBC) solver with heuristic methods, including Tabu Search and Iterative Targeted Pairwise Swap. Scalability experiment on instances with up to 100,000 orders show that CBC consistently achieves optimal solutions in under two minutes, maintaining optimality even under dynamic conditions with fluctuating factory capacities and changing customer orders. By reducing day-to-day recipe discrepancies, this approach supports more accurate ingredient forecasting, decreases food waste, and improves operational efficiency across multi-factory network. These results provide the first comprehensive solution framework for temporal allocation problems in meal kit delivery operations.</description>

      <title>Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to drive a nonlinear system to reach a target state under input constraints. The proposed controller consists only of piecewise constant inputs, generated from a simple linear driftless approximation to the original nonlinear system. First, we construct this approximation using only the effect of the control input at the initial state. Next, we partition the time horizon into successively shorter intervals and show that optimal controllers for the linear driftless system result in a bounded error from a specified target state in the nonlinear system. We also derive conditions under which the input constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied. On applying the optimal control inputs, we show that the error monotonically converges to zero as the intervals become successively shorter, thus achieving arbitrary closeness to the target state with time. Using simulation examples on classical nonlinear systems, we illustrate how the presented technique is used to reach a target state while still satisfying input constraints. In particular, we show that our method completes the task even when assumptions of the underlying theory are violated or when classical linearization-based methods may fail.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Optimal Navigation in the Cislunar Space with LFT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation in the cislunar domain presents significant challenges due to chaotic and unmodeled dynamics, as well as state-dependent sensor errors. This paper develops a robust estimation framework based on Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) models, and state estimation in $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ and $\mu$ synthesis framework to address these challenges. The cislunar dynamics are embedded into an LFT form that captures nonlinearities in the gravitational model and state-dependent sensor errors as structured uncertainty. A nonlinear estimator is then synthesized in the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense to ensure robust performance guarantees in the presence of the stated uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimator for navigation in a surveillance constellation.</description>

      <title>Chapter 8 Multi-Criteria Decision-Making: Aggregation-Type Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter describes selected aggregation-type multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that convert an alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM) into a single performance score per alternative through additive, multiplicative or hybrid manipulations, for ranking the alternatives. The 8 methods are: Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Multiplicative Exponent Weighting (MEW), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Analytic Network Process (ANP), Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS), Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA), Faire Un Choix Adequat (FUCA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). This chapter details the algorithm of each method step-by-step, illustrating every procedure with a common ACM example and full numerical calculations. Practical strengths and weaknesses of every method are outlined. A consolidated summary shows how different methods can lead to variations in the final rankings. This chapter enables the readers to: (1) explain the principles and algorithms of aggregation-type methods covered, (2) implement them on an ACM, and (3) select one or more suitable aggregation-type MCDM methods for their applications.</description>

      <title>What are Capra-Convex Sets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a specific form of abstract convexity known as Capra-convexity, where a constant along primal rays (Capra) coupling replaces the scalar product used in standard convex analysis to define generalized Fenchel conjugacies. A key motivating result is that the ${\ell}$0 pseudonorm - which counts the number of nonzero components in a vector - is equal to its Capra-biconjugate. This implies that ${\ell}$0 is a Capra-convex function, highlighting potential applications in statistics and machine learning, particularly for enforcing sparsity in models. Building on prior work characterizing the Capra-subdifferential of ${\ell}$0 and the role of source norms in defining the Capra-coupling, the paper provides a characterization of Capra-convex sets.</description>

      <title>Several Performance Bounds on Decentralized Online Optimization are Highly Conservative and Potentially Misleading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Decentralized Online Optimization algorithms using the Performance Estimation Problem approach which allows, to automatically compute exact worst-case performance of optimization algorithms. Our analysis shows that several available performance guarantees are very conservative, sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude, and can lead to misguided choices of algorithm. Moreover, at least in terms of worst-case performance, some algorithms appear not to benefit from inter-agent communications for a significant period of time. We show how to improve classical methods by tuning their step-sizes, and find that we can save up to 20% on their actual worst-case performance regret.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamic job scheduling with interruptible setup and processing times: An approach based on queueing control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic, dynamic job scheduling problem, formulated as a queueing control problem, in which a single server processes jobs of different types that arrive according to independent Poisson processes. The problem is defined on a network, with jobs arriving at designated demand points and waiting in queues to be processed by the server, which travels around the network dynamically and is able to change its course at any time. In the context of machine scheduling, this enables us to consider sequence-dependent, interruptible setup and processing times, with the network structure encoding the amounts of effort needed to switch between different tasks. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process in which the objective is to minimize long-run average holding costs and prove the existence of a stationary policy under which the system is stable, subject to a condition on the workload of the system. We then propose a class of index-based heuristic policies, show that these possess intuitively appealing structural properties and suggest how to modify these heuristics to ensure scalability to larger problem sizes. Results from extensive numerical experiments are presented in order to show that our heuristic policies perform well against suitable benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Robust Competitive Ratio for Deterministic Monopoly Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic monopoly pricing under partial knowledge of the market, where the seller has access only to summary statistics of the valuation distribution, such as the mean, dispersion, and maximum value. Using tools from distributionally robust optimization and max-min analysis, we evaluate pricing strategies based on their competitive ratio (CR). We characterize the worst-case market scenario consistent with the available information and provide a complete solution for minimizing the CR. Our analysis also covers optimal pricing under various measures of dispersion, including variance and fractional moments. Interestingly, we find that the worst-case market for CR coincides with that for expected revenue. Using proof techniques tailored to the CR framework, we further examine how dispersion and maximum valuation influence optimal deterministic pricing. These results offer practical guidance for setting robust prices when market information is limited.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the convergence rate analysis of the Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) method for finding a zero of the sum of two maximally monotone operators. We obtain an exact rate of convergence for the DRS algorithm and demonstrate its sharpness in the setting of convex feasibility problems. Furthermore, we investigate the linear convergence of the DRS algorithm, providing both necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize this behavior. We further examine the performance of the DRS method when applied to convex composite optimization problems. The paper concludes with several conjectures on the convergence behavior of the DRS algorithm for this class of problems.</description>

      <title>$\ell_0$-Norm Multiobjective Optimization Models Motivated by Applications to Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06833v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to investigating single-objective and multiobjective optimization problems involving the $\ell_0$-norm function, which is nonconvex and nondifferentiable. Our motivation comes from proton beam therapy models in cancer research. The developed approach uses subdifferential tools of variational analysis and the Gerstewitz (Tammer) scalarization function in multiobjective optimization. Based on this machinery, we propose several algorithms of the subgradient type and conduct their convergence analysis. The obtained results are illustrated by numerical examples, which reveal some characteristic features of the proposed algorithms and their interactions with the gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Space Mapping Optimization using Neural Networks for Efficient Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project focuses on optimizing input parameters of a partial derivative function of a fine model using Neural network-based Space Mapping Optimization (SMO). The fine model is known for its high accuracy but is computationally expensive. On the other hand, the coarse model is represented by a neural network, which is much faster but less accurate. The SMO approach is applied to bridge the gap between these two models and estimate the optimal input parameters for the fine model. Additionally, this project involves a comprehensive review of previously available Neuro Modeling Space Mapping techniques, which are also used in this project to enhance the optimization process. By utilizing SMO with a neural network-based coarse model, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in optimizing complex functions efficiently. The proposed approach of using Neural Network based Space Mapping offers a promising solution to this optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Optimality in Dynamic Settings: A Monotonicity-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel analytical method for studying optimal paths in dynamic optimization problems under general monotonicity conditions. The method centers on a locator function -- a simple object constructed directly from the model's primitives -- whose roots identify interior steady states and whose slope determines their local stability. Under strict concavity of the payoff function, the locator function also characterizes basins of attraction, yielding a complete description of qualitative dynamics. Without concavity, it can still deliver sharp results: if the function is single crossing from above, its root identifies a globally stable steady state; if the locator function is inverted-U-shaped with two interior roots (a typical case), only the higher root can be a locally stable interior steady state. The locator function further enables comparative statics of steady states with respect to parameters through direct analysis of its derivatives. These results are obtained without solving the full dynamic program. We illustrate the approach using a generalized neoclassical growth model, a rational (un)fitness model, and a learning-by-doing economy.</description>

      <title>Cryo-EM as a Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations, limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions, using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.</description>

      <title>Morphological Perceptron with Competitive Layer: Training Using Convex-Concave Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse Fair Multi-class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new classification framework based on the theory of coherent risk measures and systemic risk. The proposed approach is suitable for multi-class problems when the data is noisy, scarce (relative to the dimension of the problem), and the labeling might be unreliable. In the first part of our paper, we provide the foundation of the use of systemic risk models and show how to apply it in the context of linear and kernel-based multi-class problems. More advanced formulation via a system-theoretic approach with non-linear aggregation is proposed, which leads to a two-stage stochastic programming problem. A risk-averse regularized decomposition method is designed to solve the problem. We use a popular multi-class method as a benchmark in the performance analysis of the proposed classification methods. We illustrate our ideas by proposing several generalization of that method by the use of coherent measures of risk. The viability of the proposed risk-averse methods are supported theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we demonstrate that the application of systemic risk measures facilitates enforcing fairness in classification. Analysis and experiments regarding the fairness of the proposed models are carefully conducted. For all methods, our numerical experiments demonstrate that they are robust in the presence of unreliable training data and perform better on unknown data than the methods minimizing expected classification errors. Furthermore, the performance improves when the number of classes increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel real-time algorithm for controlling wave energy converters (WECs). We begin with the economic model predictive control (MPC) problem formulation and apply a novel, first-order optimization algorithm inspired by recently developed control-based algorithms for constrained optimization to define the controller dynamics according to the single-iteration MPC approach. We theoretically analyse the convergence of the employed algorithm and the computational complexity of the obtained controller. Results from simulations using a benchmark WEC system indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard MPC, thanks to the inherent ability to handle faster sampling rates.</description>

      <title>From Control to Opinion Dynamics: Signum Consensus Protocol on Arbitrary Weighted Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signum consensus protocol in continuous-time systems over arbitrary weighted directed graphs with bounded disturbances. The right-hand side of the differential equation is discontinuous on a codimension-$n$ manifold ($n &gt; 1$). On such a manifold, the Filippov sliding vector is not uniquely determined. This results in non-unique solutions and makes the analysis of the system challenging. We define the Polarization Index as the supremum of the growth rate of the difference between the maximum and minimum agent states in the system, derive its closed-form expression, and show that some solution attains this supremum at all forward times except during consensus. From this result, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus and provide a least upper bound on consensus time. To address the high computational complexity of evaluating the Polarization Index, we propose a low-average-complexity algorithm. Finally, we develop an opinion dynamics model grounded in the signum consensus protocol, revealing a fundamental link between dissensus and community structures.</description>

      <title>Separable convex optimization over indegree polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study egalitarian (acyclic) orientations of undirected graphs under indegree-based objectives, such as minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees for a strictly convex function $\varphi$, decreasing minimization (dec-min), and increasing maximization (inc-max). In the non-acyclic setting of Frank and Murota (2022), a single orientation simultaneously optimizes these three objectives, however, restricting to acyclic orientations confines us to the corners of the indegree polytope, where these fairness objectives do diverge. We establish strong hardness results across a broad range of settings: minimizing the $\varphi$-sum of indegrees is NP-hard for every discrete strictly convex function $\varphi$; dec-min and inc-max are NP-hard for every indegree bound $k \geq 2$, as well as without a bound; and the complementary inc-min and dec-max problems are NP-hard even on $3$-regular graphs. On the algorithmic side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for minimizing the maximum weighted indegree via a weighted smallest-last ordering. We also provide an exact exponential-time algorithm for minimizing general separable discrete convex objectives over indegrees, and a polynomial-time algorithm for the non-acyclic case. Finally, for maximizing the sum of the products of indegrees and outdegrees, we prove NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree $4$, give an algorithm for maximum degree $3$, and provide a $3$-approximation algorithm. Our results delineate the algorithmic frontier of convex integral optimization over indegree (base-)polytopes, and highlight both theoretical consequences and practical implications, notably for scheduling and deadlock-free routing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of system estimation to parametric perturbations in system dynamics and initial conditions. We define the problem of sensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.</description>

      <title>Distributed Automatic Generation Control subject to Ramp-Rate-Limits: Anytime Feasibility and Uniform Network-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL, the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules with few nodes supported on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadrature rules for measures supported on real algebraic and rational curves, focusing on the {odd-degree} case \(2s-1\). Adopting an optimization viewpoint, we minimize suitable penalty functions over the space of quadrature rules of strength \(2s-1\), so that optimal solutions yield rules with the minimal number of nodes. For plane algebraic curves of degree \(d\), we derive explicit node bounds depending on \(d\) and the number of places at infinity, improving results of Riener--Schweighofer, and Zalar. For rational curves in arbitrary dimension of degree \(d\), we further refine these bounds using the geometry of the parametrization and recover the classical Gaussian quadrature bound when \(d=1\). Our results reveal a direct link between the algebraic complexity of the supporting curve and the minimal size of quadrature formulas, providing a unified framework that connects real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, and moment theory.</description>

      <title>Presolving Convexified Optimal Power Flow with Mixtures of Gradient Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex relaxations and approximations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem have gained significant research and industrial interest for planning and operations in electric power networks. One approach for reducing their solve times is presolving which eliminates constraints from the problem definition, thereby reducing the burden of the underlying optimization algorithm. To this end, we propose a presolving framework for convexified optimal power flow (C-OPF) problems, which uses a novel deep learning-based architecture called MoGE (Mixture of Gradient Experts). In this framework, problem size is reduced by learning the mapping between C-OPF parameters and optimal dual variables (the latter being representable as gradients), which is then used to screen constraints that are non-binding at optimum. The validity of using this presolve framework across arbitrary families of C-OPF problems is theoretically demonstrated. We characterize generalization in MoGE and develop a post-solve recovery procedure to mitigate possible constraint classification errors. Using two different C-OPF models, we show via simulations that our framework reduces solve times by upto 34% across multiple PGLIB and MATPOWER test cases, while providing an identical solution as the full problem.</description>

      <title>On the irreducibility and convergence of a class of nonsmooth nonlinear state-space models on manifolds and their applications to zeroth-order optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a large class of general nonlinear state-space models on a state-space X, defined by the recursion $\phi_{k+1} = F(\phi_k,\alpha(\phi_k,U_{k+1}))$, $k \in\mathbb N$, where $F,\alpha$ are some functions and $\{U_{k+1}\}_{k\in\mathbb N}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. More precisely, we extend conditions under which this class of Markov chains is irreducible, aperiodic and satisfies important continuity properties, relaxing two key assumptions from prior works. First, the state-space X is supposed to be a smooth manifold instead of an open subset of a Euclidean space. Second, we only suppose that $F$ is locally Lipschitz continuous.
  We demonstrate the significance of our results through their application to Markov chains underlying optimization algorithms. These schemes belong to the class of evolution strategies with covariance matrix adaptation and step-size adaptation.</description>

      <title>Offline Learning of Decision Functions in Multiplayer Games with Expectation Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a class of stochastic multiplayer games where each player in the game aims to optimize its objective under uncertainty and adheres to some expectation constraints. The study employs an offline learning paradigm, leveraging a pre-existing dataset containing auxiliary features. While prior research in deterministic and stochastic multiplayer games primarily explored vector-valued decisions, this work departs by considering function-valued decisions that incorporate auxiliary features as input. We leverage the law of large deviations and degree theory to establish the almost sure convergence of the offline learning solution to the true solution as the number of data samples increases.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>

      <title>Distributionally robust monopoly pricing: Switching from low to high prices in volatile markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem definition: Traditional monopoly pricing assumes sellers have full information about consumer valuations. We consider monopoly pricing under limited information, where a seller only knows the mean, variance and support of the valuation distribution. The objective is to maximize expected revenue by selecting the optimal fixed price. Methodology/results: We adopt a distributionally robust framework, where the seller considers all valuation distributions that comply with the limited information. We formulate a maximin problem which seeks to maximize expected revenue for the worst-case valuation distribution. The minimization problem that identifies the worst-case valuation distribution is solved using primal-dual methods, and in turn leads to an explicitly solvable maximization problem. This yields a closed-form optimal pricing policy and a new fundamental principle prescribing when to use low and high robust prices. Managerial implications: We show that the optimal policy switches from low to high prices when variance becomes sufficiently large, yielding significant performance gains compared with existing robust prices that generally decay with market uncertainty. This presents guidelines for when the seller should switch from targeting mass markets to niche markets. Similar guidelines are obtained for delay-prone services with rational utility-maximizing customers, underlining the universality and wide applicability of the novel pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Least multivariate Chebyshev polynomials on diagonally determined sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new multivariate generalization of the classical monic (univariate) Chebyshev polynomial that minimizes the uniform norm on the interval $[-1,1]$. Let $\Pi^*_n$ be the subset of polynomials of degree at most $n$ in $d$ variables, whose homogeneous part of degree $n$ has coefficients summing up to $1$. The problem is determining a polynomial in $\Pi^*_n$ with the smallest uniform norm on a domain $\Omega$, which we call a least Chebyshev polynomial (associated with $\Omega$). Our main result solves the problem for $\Omega$ belonging to a non-trivial class of sets that we call diagonally-determined, and establishes the remarkable result that a least Chebyshev polynomial can be given via the classical, univariate, Chebyshev polynomial. In particular, the solution can be independent of the dimension. Diagonally-determined domains include centered balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in any norm, but can be non-convex and even non-simply connected. We also introduce a computational procedure, based on semidefinite programming hierarchies, to detect if a given semi-algebraic set is diagonally-determined.</description>

      <title>A Fully Parameter-Free Second-Order Algorithm for Convex-Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for the convex-concave minimax problem, which has attracted much attention in many fields such as machine learning in recent years. We propose a Lipschitz-free cubic regularization (LF-CR) algorithm for solving the convex-concave minimax optimization problem without knowing the Lipschitz constant. It can be shown that the iteration complexity of the LF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the restricted primal-dual gap is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^2\epsilon^{-2/3})$ , where $z_0=(x_0,y_0)$ is a pair of initial points, $z^*=(x^*,y^*)$ is a pair of optimal solutions, and $\rho$ is the Lipschitz constant. We further propose a fully parameter-free cubic regularization (FF-CR) algorithm that does not require any parameters of the problem, including the Lipschitz constant and the upper bound of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution. We also prove that the iteration complexity of the FF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the gradient norm is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^{4/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}) $. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of both algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FF-CR algorithm is a completely parameter-free second-order algorithm, and its iteration complexity is currently the best in terms of $\epsilon$ under the termination criterion of the gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of primal-dual augmented Lagrangian methods and duality theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of augmented Lagrangians for nonconvex optimization problems that encompasses both duality theory and convergence analysis of primal-dual augmented Lagrangian methods in the infinite dimensional setting. Our goal is to present many well-known concepts and results related to augmented Lagrangians in a unified manner and bridge a gap between existing convergence analysis of primal-dual augmented Lagrangian methods and abstract duality theory. Within our theory we specifically emphasize the role of various fundamental duality concepts (such as duality gap, optimal dual solutions, global saddle points, etc.) in convergence analysis of augmented Lagrangians methods and underline interconnections between all these concepts and convergence of primal and dual sequences generated by such methods. In particular, we prove that the zero duality gap property is a necessary condition for the boundedness of the primal sequence, while the existence of an optimal dual solution is a necessary condition for the boundedness of the sequences of multipliers and penalty parameters, irrespective of the way in which the multipliers and the penalty parameter are updated. Our theoretical results are applicable to many different augmented Lagrangians for various types of cone constrained optimization problems, including Rockafellar-Wets' augmented Lagrangian, (penalized) exponential/hyperbolic-type augmented Lagrangians, modified barrier functions, etc.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-time boundary control of second-order hyperbolic PDEs modeled flexible string systems via backstepping design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary control scheme for prescribed-time (PT) stable of flexible string systems via backstepping method, and the dynamics of such systems modeled by Hamilton's principle is described as second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Initially, to construct a boundary controller with PT stabilization capacity, a PT stable hyperbolic PDEs system with time-varying coefficient is chosen as the target system, and a corresponding Volterra integral transform with time-varying kernel function is considered. Then, to identify the boundary controller, the well-posedness of kernel equation is derived by means of successive approximation and mathematical induction, and the upper bound of kernel function is estimated. Furthermore, the inverse transform is proved with the help of a similar process for kernel function. Subsequently, the PT stability of closed-loop system is proved by PT stability of target system and reversible integral transform. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend ISS small-gain theorems from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with an infinite network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient structure-exploiting algorithm for multistage optimization problems. The proposed method extends existing approaches by supporting full coupling between stages and global decision variables in the cost, as well as equality and inequality constraints. The algorithm is implemented as a new backend in the PIQP solver and leverages a specialized block-tri-diagonal-arrow Cholesky factorization within a proximal interior-point framework to handle the underlying problem structure efficiently. The implementation features automatic structure detection and seamless integration with existing interfaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving up to 13x speed-up compared to a generic sparse backend and matching/exceeding the performance of the state-of-the-art specialized solver HPIPM. The solver is particularly effective for applications such as model predictive control, robust scenario optimization, and periodic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Feedback Optimization with Model Uncertainty: A Regularization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback optimization optimizes the steady state of a dynamical system by implementing optimization iterations in closed loop with the plant. It relies on online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output sensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of observation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing closed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties, we pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop performance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty sets. We provide tractable reformulations for the corresponding min-max problems via regularizations and characterize the online closed-loop performance through the tracking error in case of time-varying optimal solutions. Simulations on a distribution grid illustrate the effectiveness of our robust feedback optimization controller in addressing sensitivity mismatches in a non-stationary environment.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model Predictive Control for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DBS is typically implemented in open-loop, closed-loop DBS (CLDBS) uses the amplitude of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands (e.g. beta 13-30 Hz) as a feedback signal, resulting in improved treatment outcomes with reduced side effects and slower rates of patient habituation to stimulation. To date, CLDBS has only been implemented in vivo with simple algorithms such as proportional, proportional-integral, and thresholded switching control. Our approach employs a multi-step predictor based on differences of input-convex neural networks to model the future evolution of beta oscillations. The use of a multi-step predictor enhances prediction accuracy over the optimization horizon and simplifies online computation. In tests using a simulated model of beta-band activity response and data from PD patients, we achieve reductions of more than 20% in both tracking error and control activity in comparison with existing CLDBS algorithms. The proposed control strategy provides a generalizable data-driven technique that can be applied to the treatment of PD and other diseases targeted by CLDBS, as well as to other neuromodulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimally Linearizing Power Flow Equations for Improved Power System Dispatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing power grids with the increasing presence of variable renewable energy-based (distributed) generation involves solving high-dimensional optimization tasks at short intervals. Linearizing the AC power flow (PF) constraints is a standard practice to ease the computational burden at the cost of hopefully acceptable inaccuracies. However, the design of these PF linearizations has traditionally been agnostic of the use case. Towards bridging the linearization-application gap, we first model the complete operational sequence needed to implement optimal power flow (OPF) decisions on power systems and characterize the effect of PF linearization on the resulting steady-state system operation. We then propose a novel formulation for obtaining optimal PF constraint linearizations to harness desirable system-operation attributes such as low generation cost and engineering-limit violations. To pursue the optimal PF linearization, we develop a gradient-based approach backed by sensitivity analysis of optimization routines and AC PF equations. Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in traversing the cost-optimality vs operational feasibility trade-off inherent to OPF approximations.</description>

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>A relaxed version of Ryu's three-operator splitting method for structured nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modification of Ryu's splitting algorithm for minimizing the sum of three functions, where two of them are convex with Lipschitz continuous gradients, and the third is an arbitrary proper closed function that is not necessarily convex. The modification is essential to facilitate the convergence analysis, particularly in establishing a sufficient descent property for an associated envelope function. This envelope, tailored to the proposed method, is an extension of the well-known Moreau envelope. Notably, the original Ryu splitting algorithm is recovered as a limiting case of our proposal. The results show that the descent property holds as long as the stepsizes remain sufficiently small. Leveraging this result, we prove global subsequential convergence to critical points of the nonconvex objective.</description>

      <title>Stability of Polling Systems for a Large Class of Markovian Switching Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a polling system with two queues, where a single server is attending the queues in a cyclic order and requires non-zero switching times to switch between the queues. Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of `robust' polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues.</description>

      <title>Constrained Average-Reward Intermittently Observable MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with intermittent state information, decision-making becomes challenging due to periods of missing observations. Linear programming (LP) methods can play a crucial role in solving MDPs, in particular, with constraints. However, the resultant belief MDPs lead to infinite dimensional LPs, even when the original MDP is with finite state and action spaces. The verification of strong duality becomes non-trivial. This paper investigates the conditions for no duality gap in average-reward finite Markov decision process with intermittent state observations. We first establish that in such MDPs, the belief MDP is unichain if the original Markov chain is recurrent. Furthermore, we establish strong duality of the problem under the same assumption. Finally, we provide a wireless channel example, where the belief state depends on the last channel state received and the age of the channel state. Our numerical results indicate interesting properties of the solution.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ADMM with batch size adaptation for nonconvex nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) is a popular method for solving nonconvex nonsmooth optimization in various applications. However, it typically requires an empirical selection of the static batch size for gradient estimation, resulting in a challenging trade-off between variance reduction and computational cost. This paper proposes adaptive batch size SADMM, a practical method that dynamically adjusts the batch size based on accumulated differences along the optimization path. We develop a simple convergence analysis to handle the dependence of batch size adaptation that matches the best-known complexity with flexible parameter choices. We further extend this adaptive scheme to reduce the overall complexity of the popular variance-reduced methods, SVRG-ADMM and SPIDER-ADMM. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Direct Pseudospectral Optimal Control by Orthogonal Polynomial Integral Collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper details a methodology to transcribe an optimal control problem into a nonlinear program for generation of the trajectories that optimize a given functional by approximating only the highest order derivatives of a given system's dynamics. The underlying method uses orthogonal polynomial integral collocation by which successive integrals are taken to approximate all lower order states. Hence, one set of polynomial coefficients can represent an entire coordinate's degree of freedom. Specifically, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind and Legendre polynomials are used over their associated common interpolating grids derived from the bases' roots and extrema. Simple example problems compare different polynomial bases' performance to analytical solutions. The planar circular orbit raising problem is used to verify the method with solutions obtained by other pseudospectral methods in literature. Finally, a rocket landing flip maneuver problem is solved to demonstrate the ability to solve complex problems with multiple states and control variables with constraints. Simulations establish this method's performance, and reveal that the polynomial/node choice for a given problem notably affects the performance.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Continuous-Time MILP for Integrated Aircraft Hangar Scheduling and Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft MRO hangars requires the integration of spatial layout with time-continuous scheduling to minimize operational costs. We propose a continuous-time mixed-integer linear program that jointly optimizes aircraft placement and timing, overcoming the scalability limits of prior formulations. A comprehensive study benchmarks the model against a constructive heuristic, probes large-scale performance, and quantifies its sensitivity to temporal congestion. The model achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups on benchmarks from the literature, solving a long-standing congested instance in 0.11 seconds, and finds proven optimal solutions for instances with up to 40 aircraft. Within a one-hour limit for large-scale problems, the model finds solutions with small optimality gaps for instances up to 80 aircraft and provides strong bounds for problems with up to 160 aircraft. Optimized plans consistently increase hangar throughput (e.g., +33% serviced aircraft vs. a heuristic on instance RND-N030-I03), leading to lower delay penalties and higher asset utilization. These findings establish that exact optimization has become computationally viable for large-scale hangar planning, providing a validated tool that balances solution quality and computation time for strategic and operational decisions.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Bandit Convex Optimization: An Optimal Algorithm with Two-Point Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies bandit convex optimization in non-stationary environments with two-point feedback, using dynamic regret as the performance measure. We propose an algorithm based on bandit mirror descent that extends naturally to non-Euclidean settings. Let $T$ be the total number of iterations and $\mathcal{P}_{T,p}$ the path variation with respect to the $\ell_p$-norm. In Euclidean space, our algorithm matches the optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{dT(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,2})})$, improving upon \citet{zhao2021bandit} by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$. Beyond Euclidean settings, our algorithm achieves an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d)T\log(T)(1 + \mathcal{P}_{T,1})})$ on the simplex, which is nearly optimal up to log factors. For the cross-polytope, the bound reduces to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d)T(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,p})})$ for some $p = 1 + 1/\log(d)$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Damping for the 1D Wave Equation Using a Single Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational structures are susceptible to catastrophic failures or structural damages when external forces induce resonances or repeated unwanted oscillations. One common mitigation strategy is to use dampers to suppress these disturbances. This leads to the problem of finding optimal damper viscosities and positions for a given vibrational structure. Although extensive research exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper positions remains challenging due to its discrete nature. To overcome this, we introduce a novel model for the damped wave equation (at the PDE level) with a damper of viscosity $\mathfrak{g}$ at position $\mathfrak{p}$ and develop a system-theoretic input/output-based analysis in the frequency domain. In this system-theoretic formulation, while we consider average displacement as the output, for input (forcing), we analyze two separate cases, namely, the uniform and boundary forcing. For both cases, explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding transfer functions, parametrized by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. This explicit parametrization by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ facilitates analyzing the optimal damping problem (at the PDE level) using norms such as the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norms. We also examine limiting cases, such as when the viscosity is very large or when no external damping is present. To illustrate our approach, we present numerical examples, compare different optimization criteria, and discuss the impact of damping parameters on the damped wave equation.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>Small-time local control of a Schr\"odinger equation: a negative and a positive quadratic result</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the small-time local controllability (STLC) of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary conditions near its ground state. We focus on the degenerate case where the linearized system is not controllable, necessitating a second-order analysis. We prove two complementary results. The negative result provides a new PDE instance of Sussmann's classical quadratic obstruction, corresponding to a non-vanishing Lie bracket. The positive result appears to be the first to establish STLC at the quadratic order for a physical PDE with a single scalar control.
  Both proofs rely on a Fourier-based approach, which is crucial because the integral kernel of the second-order term lacks the regularity required by standard integration-by-parts arguments. Along the way, we develop tools valid in a more general setting to analyze such quadratic forms. In particular, we prove results that allow for the multiplication of a kernel by a modulation function.</description>

      <title>Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems, termed Gaussian behaviors, that describes finite-length trajectories of a system as a Gaussian process. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.</description>

      <title>Grower-in-the-Loop Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Climate Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions. Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However, interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs, achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast, reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization, classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions. Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.</description>

      <title>AdaGrad Meets Muon: Adaptive Stepsizes for Orthogonal Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient. Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon and Adam.</description>
