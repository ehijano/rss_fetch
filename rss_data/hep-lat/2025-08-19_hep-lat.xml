      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions V: complex $\phi^4$ field model in $3+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2024zal} and associated studies, a relativistic finite-volume formalism in $1+1$ dimensions is proposed to extract infinite-volume scattering phaseshift.
  It is based on the difference of integrated correlation functions (ICF) rather than energy spectrum in the finite volume, and can be regarded as complementary to the well-known L\"{uscher} formalism.
  In the present work, the formalism is further extended into $3+1$ dimensional spacetime. The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.</description>

      <title>QCD Sum Rule Study of the Tensor $\Delta^0\Delta^0$ Dibaryon State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exotic $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon state with quantum numbers $J^{P} = 2^{+}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. A tensor interpolating current is constructed to determine the mass and residue of this state, including explicit calculations of contributions from quark, gluon, and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension nine. The numerical analysis yields a mass of $m_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = 2426^{+101}_{-108}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and a residue of $f_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = \left( 2.30^{+0.49}_{-0.45} \right) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV}^{8}$. The predicted mass lies about $38~\mathrm{MeV}$ below the $2m_{\Delta^{0}}$ threshold, which indicates the possible existence of a bound molecular configuration. Consequently, the tensor $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon may serve as a promising candidate for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>The NN$\Omega_{ccc}$ Bound-States with the HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newly, first-principles lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass, $ m_\pi \backsimeq 137.1 $ MeV, have been reported by the HAL QCD Collaboration for the S-wave interaction between the nucleon (N) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{ccc}$). The N$\Omega_{ccc}$ potentials in the spin-1 $ \left(^{3}S_{1}\right) $ and spin-2 $ \left(^{5}S_{2}\right) $ channels were derived and found to be attractive, though no bound state was supported in these channels. It is shown that, when the spin-1 and spin-2 N$\Omega_{ccc}$ channels are combined with the realistic NN Malfliet-Tjon (MT) potential in the $ ^{3}S_{1} $ channel, bound states of deuteron (d)-$\Omega_{ccc}$ are generated with binding energies near 1.3 MeV and 1.2 MeV for the states with quantum numbers $(I)J^{\pi} = (0)1/2^{+}$ and $(0)5/2^{+}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Pentaquarks with Born--Oppenheimer effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, all with isospin $I = 1/2$, were discovered by the LHCb collaboration in the decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$. Although their quantum numbers remain undetermined, these states have generated significant theoretical interest. We analyze their spectrum and decay patterns-including those of their spin partners-within the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT), a framework grounded in QCD. At leading order in BOEFT, we identify these pentaquark states as bound states in BO potentials that exhibit at short-distance a repulsive octet behavior and a nonperturbative shift due to the adjoint baryons masses, while asymptotically approaching the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ threshold. We further incorporate ${\cal O}(1/m_Q)$ spin-dependent corrections to compute pentaquark multiplet spin splittings. Based on the spectrum, semi-inclusive decay widths to $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$, and the decay width ratios to $\Lambda_c\bar{D}$ and $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^*$, we provide the first theoretical predictions for the adjoint baryon masses, which can be confirmed by future lattice QCD studies. Moreover, our analysis supports the quantum number assignments: $J^{P} = (1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $(1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, and $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$. We also present results for the lowest bottom pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Kaon radiative leptonic decay rates from lattice QCD simulations at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the radiative leptonic decay rates of the kaon, improving upon our previous work, arXiv:2006.05358. Our analysis uses gauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For the first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including quark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been implemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light- and strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated using lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \simeq 3.8\,\mathrm{fm}$ to $L \simeq 7.7\,\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on three lattice spacings in the range $a \in [0.08, 0.058]\,\mathrm{fm}$. As a result of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation functions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form factors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When compared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \to e^- \bar{\nu}_e \gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$ standard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are compatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the muonic decay channel ($K^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \gamma$), we confirm the tensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD predictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the value of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.</description>

      <title>The geometric phase transition of the three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After fifty years of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the nature of the transition between their topological phases (confinement/deconfinement) remains challenging due to the absence of a local order parameter. In this work, we conduct a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model using intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, offering fresh insights into the topological phase transitions of gauge-invariant systems. We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$, with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at $T_{\rm c}$, enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition. This work sheds new light on the critical behavior of pure LGTs, with potential implications for condensed matter systems and quantum error correction.</description>
