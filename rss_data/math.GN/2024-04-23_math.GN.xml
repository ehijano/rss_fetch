      <title>On monoids of metric preserving functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{X}$ be a class of metric spaces and let $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}}$ be the set of all $f:[0, \infty)\to [0, \infty)$ preserving $\mathbf{X},$ $(Y, f\circ\rho)\in\mathbf{X}$ whenever $(Y, \rho)\in\mathbf{X}.$ For arbitrary subset $\mathbf{A}$ of the set of all metric preserving functions we show that the equality $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}}=\mathbf{A}$ has a solution iff $\mathbf{A}$ is a monoid with respect to the operation of function composition. In particular, for the set $\mathbf{SI}$ of all amenable subadditive increasing functions there is a class $\mathbf{X}$ of metric spaces such that $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{X}}=\mathbf{SI}$ holds, which gives a positive answer to the question of paper [1].</description>

      <title>Hyperspaces of the double arrow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{S}$ denote the double arrow of Alexandroff and the Sorgenfrey line, respectively. We show that for any $n\geq 1$, the space of all unions of at most $n$ closed intervals of $\mathbb{A}$ is not homogeneous. We also prove that the spaces of non-trivial convergent sequences of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{S}$ are homogeneous. This partially solves an open question of A. Arhangel'ski\v{i}. In contrast, we show that the space of closed intervals of $\mathbb{S}$ is homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Weak Lipschitz structures and their connections with the topological structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two approaches to Lipschitz structures for any set are presented, studied and compared. The first approach is similar to the one proposed in Fraser, Jr. R. B., Axiom systems for Lipschitz structures, Fundamenta Mathematicae, (1970), where Lipschitz structures are defined as families of pseudo-metrics satisfying suitable conditions. The other one, here introduced, is expressed by using weak pseudo-metrics, which (unlike the pseudo-metrics) do not necessarily vanish on the whole of the diagonal of the cartesian product of the considered set. In this case we will talk about weak Lipschitz structures. Since all topological structures are defined by a a family of weak pseudo-metrics (as we will show in Section 4) we can find some connections between topological structures and weak Lipschitz structures, and a link between continuous maps and weak Lipschitz maps.
  A central part of this paper is devoted to the weak Lipschitz uniformity defined by a weak Lipschitz structure, which is introduced in Section 8. A notion of uniform continuity with respect to weak Lipschitz uniformities is proposed and studied. In particular, we prove that the weak Lipschitz maps acting between two weak Lipschitz spaces are uniformly continuous with respect to the weak Lipschitz uniformities defined by the respective weak Lipschitz structures.</description>

      <title>Monadic functors forgetful of (dis)inhibited actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results of the following common flavor: for a category $\mathcal{C}$ of topological or uniform spaces with all manner of other properties of common interest (separation / completeness / compactness axioms), a group (or monoid) $\mathbb{G}$ equipped with various types of topological structure (topologies, uniformities) and the corresponding category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}$ of appropriately compatible $\mathbb{G}$-flows in $\mathcal{C}$, the forgetful functor $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}\to \mathcal{C}$ is monadic. In all cases of interest the domain category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}$ is also cocomplete, so that results on adjunction lifts along monadic functors apply to provide equivariant completion and/or compactification functors. This recovers, unifies and generalizes a number of such results in the literature due to de Vries, Mart'yanov and others on existence of equivariant compactifications / completions and cocompleteness of flow categories.</description>

      <title>Ideal Analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give natural examples of $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$-complete and $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete sets.
  In the first part, we consider ideals on $\omega$. In particular, we show that the Hindman ideal $\mathcal{H}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete and consider a number of ideals generated in the similar fashion. Moreover, we show that the ideal $\mathcal{D}$ is also $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete.
  In the second part, we focus on families of trees (on $\omega$ and $2$). We show that the family of trees containing Silver trees in $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$-complete.</description>
