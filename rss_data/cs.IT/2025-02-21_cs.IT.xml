      <title>Goggin's corrected Kalman Filter: Guarantees and Filtering Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit a non-linear filter for {\em non-Gaussian} noises that was introduced in [1]. Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin's filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin's setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and unlike most other works in filtering, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises.
  Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem.
  Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes -- where trivial filters are nearly optimal -- and a {\em balanced} regime, which is where Goggin's filter has the most value. \footnote{This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

      <title>A Low-Complexity Scheme for Multi-Message Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a fundamental problem in the broader fields of security and privacy. In recent years, the problem has garnered significant attention from the research community, leading to achievability schemes and converse results for many important PIR settings.
  This paper focuses on the Multi-message Private Information Retrieval (MPIR) setting, where a user aims to retrieve \(D\) messages from a database of \(K\) messages, with identical copies of the database available on \(N\) remote servers. The user's goal is to maximize the download rate while keeping the identities of the retrieved messages private. Existing approaches to the MPIR problem primarily focus on either scalar-linear solutions or vector-linear solutions, the latter requiring a high degree of subpacketization. Furthermore, prior scalar-linear solutions are restricted to the special case of \(N = D+1\). This limitation hinders the practical adoption of these schemes, as real-world applications demand simple, easily implementable solutions that support a broad range of scenarios.
  In this work, we present a solution for the MPIR problem, which applies to a broader range of system parameters and requires a limited degree of subpacketization. In particular, the proposed scheme applies to all values of \(N=DL+1\) for any integer \(L\geq 1\), and requires a degree of subpacketization \(L\). Our scheme achieves capacity when \(D\) divides \(K\), and in all other cases, its performance matches or comes within a small additive margin of the best-known scheme that requires a high degree of subpacketization.</description>

      <title>Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization for Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Optimal Solutions and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system enabled by movable antennas (MAs), which can dynamically adjust antenna positions to enhance both sensing and communication performance for future wireless networks. To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we first derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized for optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. In particular, for the case with receive MAs only, we provide a closed-form optimal antenna position solution, and show that employing MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) can achieve a sensing performance gain upper-bounded by 4.77 dB. On the other hand, for the case with transmit MAs only, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution in the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. While in the scenario with non-LoS (NLoS) channels, a majorization-minimization (MM) based Rosen's gradient projection (RGP) algorithm with an efficient initialization method is proposed to obtain stationary solutions for the considered problem, which can be extended to the general case with both transmit and receive MAs. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with FPAs in terms of sensing and communication performance trade-off.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores extremal self-dual double circulant (DC) codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes of arbitrary length over the Galois field $\mathbb F_2$. We establish the sufficient and necessary conditions for DC codes and bordered DC codes to be self-dual and identify the conditions for self-dual DC codes of length up to 44 to be extremal or non-extremal. Additionally, The self-duality and extremality between DC codes and bordered DC codes are also examined. Finally, sufficient conditions for bordered DC codes to be LCD codes over $\mathbb F_2$ under Euclidean inner product are presented.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Isometry Property for Measurements from Group Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that sparse recovery by measurements from random circulant matrices provides good recovery bounds. We generalize this to measurements that arise as a random orbit of a group representation for some finite group G. We derive estimates for the number of measurements required to guarantee the restricted isometry property with high probability. Following this, we present several examples highlighting the role of appropriate representation-theoretic assumptions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Near-Far Field Boundary in Dual-Polarized XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is expected to be an important technology in future sixth generation (6G) networks. Compared with conventional single-polarized XL-MIMO, where signals are transmitted and received in only one polarization direction, dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems achieve higher data rate by improving multiplexing performances, and thus are the focus of this paper. Due to enlarged aperture, near-field regions become non-negligible in XL-MIMO communications, necessitating accurate near-far field boundary characterizations. However, existing boundaries developed for single-polarized systems only consider phase or power differences across array elements while irrespective of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) variances in dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems, deteriorating transmit covariance optimization performances. In this paper, we revisit near-far field boundaries for dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems by taking XPD differences into account, which faces the following challenge. Unlike existing near-far field boundaries, which only need to consider co-polarized channel components, deriving boundaries for dual-polarized XL-MIMO systems requires modeling joint effects of co-polarized and cross-polarized components. To address this issue, we model XPD variations across antennas and introduce a non-uniform XPD distance to complement existing near-far field boundaries. Based on the new distance criterion, we propose an efficient scheme to optimize transmit covariance. Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the Reed-Muller family by replacing the group $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Similar to the Reed-Muller codes, this class is closed under duality and has rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. We also construct quantum CSS codes arising from the Coxeter codes, which admit transversal logical operators outside of the Clifford group.</description>

      <title>Tracking and Assigning Jobs to a Markov Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted communication system with a machine, a cloud server, and a sampler. Job requests from the users are queued on the server to be completed by the machine. The machine has two states, namely, a busy state and a free state. The server can assign a job to the machine in a first-in-first-served manner. If the machine is free, it completes the job request from the server; otherwise, it drops the request. Upon dropping a job request, the server is penalized. When the machine is in the free state, the machine can get into the busy state with an internal job. When the server does not assign a job request to the machine, the state of the machine evolves as a symmetric Markov chain. If the machine successfully accepts the job request from the server, the state of the machine goes to the busy state and follows a different dynamics compared to the dynamics when the machine goes to the busy state due to an internal job. The sampler samples the state of the machine and sends it to the server via an error-free channel. Thus, the server can estimate the state of the machine, upon receiving an update from the source. If the machine is in the free state but the estimated state at the server is busy, the sampler pays a cost. We incorporate the concept of the age of incorrect information to model the cost of the sampler. We aim to find an optimal sampling policy such that the cost of the sampler plus the penalty on the machine gets minimized. We formulate this problem in a Markov decision process framework and find how an optimal policy changes with several associated parameters. We show that a threshold policy is optimal for this problem. We show a necessary and sufficient condition for a threshold policy to be optimal. Finally, we find the optimal threshold without bounding the state space.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Augmenting Lossy Compressors with Topological Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological descriptors such as contour trees are widely utilized in scientific data analysis and visualization, with applications from materials science to climate simulations. It is desirable to preserve topological descriptors when data compression is part of the scientific workflow for these applications. However, classic error-bounded lossy compressors for volumetric data do not guarantee the preservation of topological descriptors, despite imposing strict pointwise error bounds. In this work, we introduce a general framework for augmenting any lossy compressor to preserve the topology of the data during compression. Specifically, our framework quantifies the adjustments (to the decompressed data) needed to preserve the contour tree and then employs a custom variable-precision encoding scheme to store these adjustments. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in augmenting classic compressors (such as SZ3, TTHRESH, and ZFP) and deep learning-based compressors (such as Neurcomp) with topological guarantees.</description>

      <title>On Theoretical Limits of Learning with Label Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label differential privacy (DP) is designed for learning problems involving private labels and public features. While various methods have been proposed for learning under label DP, the theoretical limits remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of learning with label DP in both local and central models for both classification and regression tasks, characterized by minimax convergence rates. We establish lower bounds by converting each task into a multiple hypothesis testing problem and bounding the test error. Additionally, we develop algorithms that yield matching upper bounds. Our results demonstrate that under label local DP (LDP), the risk has a significantly faster convergence rate than that under full LDP, i.e. protecting both features and labels, indicating the advantages of relaxing the DP definition to focus solely on labels. In contrast, under the label central DP (CDP), the risk is only reduced by a constant factor compared to full DP, indicating that the relaxation of CDP only has limited benefits on the performance.</description>

Abstract: In the last year, there have been some remarkable improvements in the combinatorial list-size bounds of Folded Reed Solomon codes and multiplicity codes. Starting from the work on Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf and Wootters (SIAM J. Comput. 2023) (and subsequent simplifications due to Tamo (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 2024), we have had dramatic improvements in the list-size bounds of FRS codes due to Srivastava (SODA 2025) and Chen &amp; Zhang (STOC 2025). In this note, we give a short exposition of these three results (Tamo, Srivastava and Chen-Zhang).</description>

      <title>Discovering highly efficient low-weight quantum error-correcting codes with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is expected to hinge on quantum error-correcting codes. In the quest for more efficient quantum fault tolerance, a critical code parameter is the weight of measurements that extract information about errors to enable error correction: as higher measurement weights require higher implementation costs and introduce more errors, it is important in code design to optimize measurement weight. This underlies the surging interest in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, the study of which has primarily focused on the asymptotic (large-code-limit) properties. In this work, we introduce a versatile and computationally efficient approach to stabilizer code weight reduction based on reinforcement learning (RL), which produces new low-weight codes that substantially outperform the state of the art in practically relevant parameter regimes, extending significantly beyond previously accessible small distances. For example, our approach demonstrates savings in physical qubit overhead compared to existing results by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude for weight 6 codes and brings the overhead into a feasible range for near-future experiments. We also investigate the interplay between code parameters using our RL framework, offering new insights into the potential efficiency and power of practically viable coding strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate how RL can effectively advance the crucial yet challenging problem of quantum code discovery and thereby facilitate a faster path to the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Approximate Message-Passing for Compressed Sensing with Sublinear Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of an unknown signal vector with sublinear sparsity from generalized linear measurements. Generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) is proposed via state evolution in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal dimension $N$, measurement dimension $M$, and signal sparsity $k$ satisfy $\log k/\log N\to \gamma\in[0, 1)$ and $M/\{k\log (N/k)\}\to\delta$ as $N$ and $k$ tend to infinity. While the overall flow in state evolution is the same as that for linear sparsity, each proof step for inner denoising requires stronger assumptions than those for linear sparsity. The required new assumptions are proved for Bayesian inner denoising. When Bayesian outer and inner denoisers are used in GAMP, the obtained state evolution recursion is utilized to evaluate the prefactor $\delta$ in the sample complexity, called reconstruction threshold. If and only if $\delta$ is larger than the reconstruction threshold, Bayesian GAMP can achieve asymptotically exact signal reconstruction. In particular, the reconstruction threshold is finite for noisy linear measurements when the support of non-zero signal elements does not include a neighborhood of zero. As numerical examples, this paper considers linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. Numerical simulations for both cases show that Bayesian GAMP outperforms existing algorithms for sublinear sparsity in terms of the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Design of Wavelet Filter Banks for Any Dilation Using Extended Laplacian Pyramid Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for designing wavelet filter banks for any dilation matrices and in any dimension. Our approach utilizes extended Laplacian pyramid matrices to achieve this flexibility. By generalizing recent tight wavelet frame construction methods based on the sum of squares representation, we introduce the sum of vanishing products (SVP) condition, which is significantly easier to satisfy. These flexible design methods rely on our main results, which establish the equivalence between the SVP and mixed unitary extension principle conditions. Additionally, we provide illustrative examples to showcase our main findings.</description>

Abstract: An M-sequence generated by a primitive polynomial has many interesting and desirable properties. A pseudo-random array is the two-dimensional generalization of an M-sequence. Similarly to primitive polynomials, there are irreducible and reducible polynomials whose all nonzero sequences have the same length. In this paper, a two-dimensional generalization for such sequences is given. This generalization is for a pseudo-random array code which is a set of $r_1 \times r_2$ arrays in which each $n_1 \times n_2$ nonzero matrix is contained exactly once as a window in one of the arrays. Moreover, these arrays have the shift-and-add property, i.e., the bitwise addition of two arrays (or a nontrivial shift of such arrays) is another array (or a shift of another array) from the code. All the known arrays can be formed by folding sequences generated from an irreducible polynomial or a reducible polynomial whose factors have the same degree and the same exponent. Two proof techniques are used to prove the parameters of the constructed arrays. The first one is based on another method for constructing some of these arrays. The second one is a generalization of a known proof technique. This generalization enables to present pseudo-random arrays with parameters not known before and also a variety of pseudo-random array codes which cannot be generated by the first method. The two techniques also suggest two different hierarchies between pseudo-random array codes. Finally, a method to verify whether a folding of sequences, generated by these polynomials, yields a pseudo-random array or a pseudo-random array code, will be presented.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Coupled QDLPC Codes</title>

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes is a class of convolutional LDPC codes that has been well investigated in classical coding theory thanks to their high performance and compatibility with low-latency decoders. We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from strong converse exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deepen the study of properties of the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information, which is defined as the minimization of the sandwiched divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite state relative to any product state. In particular, we prove a novel duality relation for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$ by employing Sion's minimax theorem, and we prove additivity for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$. Previously, additivity was only known for $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$, but has been conjectured for $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$. Furthermore, we show that the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$ attains operational meaning in the context of binary quantum state discrimination as it is linked to certain strong converse exponents.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Spectral Estimator and MLE for Orthogonal Group Synchronization</title>

Abstract: Orthogonal group synchronization aims to recover orthogonal group elements from their noisy pairwise measurements. It has found numerous applications including computer vision, imaging science, and community detection. Due to the orthogonal constraints, it is often challenging to find the least squares estimator in presence of noise. In the recent years, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and spectral methods have proven to be powerful tools in recovering the group elements. In particular, under additive Gaussian noise, the SDR exactly produces the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and both MLE and spectral methods are able to achieve near-optimal statistical error. In this work, we take one step further to quantify the uncertainty of the MLE and spectral estimators by considering their distributions. By leveraging the orthogonality constraints in the likelihood function, we obtain a second-order expansion of the MLE and spectral estimator with the leading terms as an anti-symmetric Gaussian random matrix that is on the tangent space of the orthogonal matrix. This also implies state-of-the-art min-max risk bounds and a confidence region of each group element as a by-product. Our works provide a general theoretical framework that is potentially useful to find an approximate distribution of the estimators arising from many statistical inference problems with manifold constraints. The numerical experiments confirm our theoretical contribution.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Multivariate Information Rates in Networks of Random Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04555</link>

Abstract: The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing high-order interdependencies in complex network systems. However, its application to dynamic processes remains challenging due to the implicit assumption of memorylessness, which often falls in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the framework of Partial Information Rate Decomposition (PIRD) that extends PID to random processes with temporal correlations. By leveraging mutual information rate (MIR) instead of mutual information (MI), our approach decomposes the dynamic information shared by multivariate random processes into unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions obtained aggregating information rate atoms in a principled manner. To solve PIRD, we define a pointwise redundancy rate function based on the minimum MI principle applied locally in the frequency-domain representation of the processes. The framework is validated in benchmark simulations of Gaussian systems, demonstrating its advantages over traditional PID in capturing temporal correlations and showing how the spectral representation may reveal scale-specific higher-order interactions that are obscured in the time domain. Furthermore, we apply PIRD to a physiological network comprising cerebrovascular and cardiovascular variables, revealing frequency-dependent redundant information exchange during a protocol of postural stress. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for the full temporal statistical structure and spectral content of vector random processes to meaningfully perform information decomposition in network systems with dynamic behavior such as those typically encountered in neuroscience and physiology.</description>
