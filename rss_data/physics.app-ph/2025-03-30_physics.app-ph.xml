      <title>Phase-preserving nonreciprocal dynamics in coupled nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is most commonly associated with a large difference in the transmitted energy when the locations of the source and receiver are interchanged. This energy bias is accompanied by a difference in the transmitted phase. We highlight the role of this phase bias in breaking reciprocity in the steady-state vibration transmission characteristics of coupled nonlinear systems to external harmonic excitation. We show that breaking of reciprocity is most commonly accompanied by a simultaneous bias in the transmitted energy and phase. Energy bias alone, without any contribution from phase, can still lead to nonreciprocity, but only at very finely tuned system parameters. We provide a methodology for realizing response regimes of phase-preserving nonreciprocity using two independent symmetry-breaking parameters in the system. Our findings highlight the key contribution of phase in nonlinear nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Supersonic wave propagation in active non-Hermitian acoustic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a group velocity higher than the speed of sound in a waveguide is a challenging task in acoustic wave engineering. Even more challenging is to achieve this velocity increase without any intervention with the waveguide profile, such as narrowing or widening, and particularly without interfering with the passage by flexible inclusions, either passive or active. Here, we approach this problem by invoking concepts from non- Hermitian physics, and imposing them using active elements that are smoothly sealed within the waveguide wall. In a real-time feedback operation, the elements induce local pressure gain and loss, as well as non-local pressure integration couplings. We employ a dedicated balancing between the control parameters, derived from lattice theory and adjusted to the waveguide system, to drive the dynamics into a stable parity-time-symmetric regime. We demonstrate the accelerated propagation of a wave packet both numerically and experimentally in an air-filled waveguide and discuss the trade-off between stabilization and the achievable velocity increase. Our work prepares the grounds for advanced forms of wave transmission in continuous media, enabled by short and long range active couplings, created via embedded real-time feedback control.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Nanotube/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterojunction PIN Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is gaining attention as a promising semiconductor for next-generation high-power, high-efficiency, and high-temperature electronic devices, thanks to its exceptional material properties. However, challenges such as the lack of viable p-type doping have hindered its full potential, particularly in the development of ambipolar devices. This work introduces a novel heterojunction diode (HD) that combines p-type carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with i/n-type $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to overcome these limitations. For the first time, a CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ hetero-p-n-junction diode is fabricated. Compared to a traditional Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with the same $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ epilayer, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD demonstrates significant improvements, including a higher rectifying ratio ($1.2 \times 10^{11}$), a larger turn-on voltage (1.96 V), a drastically reduced leakage current at temperatures up to 300 {\deg}C, and a 26.7% increase in breakdown voltage. Notably, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD exhibits a low ideality factor of 1.02, signifying an ideal interface between the materials. These results underline the potential of CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunctions for electronic applications, offering a promising solution to current limitations in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based devices.</description>

      <title>Beam Manipulation for Terahertz Communications: A New Quality Productive Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz frequency band, ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz, offers extensive spectral resources for next-generation wireless communication systems. To compensate for the limited transmission power of terahertz transceivers and the significant propagation losses in terahertz channels, high-gain directional antennas are essential. Dynamic beam manipulation is therefore crucial for enabling practical communication applications. Moreover, the stringent gain requirements in terahertz systems result in an expanded Fresnel region, highlighting the critical need for efficient beam manipulation techniques in both near-field and far-field conditions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of terahertz beam manipulation techniques. It begins with an introduction of diffraction theory as the foundational propagation model for beam manipulation. Detailed examples tailored to specific communication scenarios are then presented. Experimental verifications using 3-D printed lenses are included for three distinct beam manipulation cases. Alternative approaches for achieving beam manipulation, such as metasurfaces and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Polarization Decoupling Multi-Port Beam-Splitting Metasurface for Miniaturized Magneto-Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In regular magneto-optical trap (MOT) systems, the delivery of six circularly polarized (CP) cooling beams requires complex and bulky optical arrangements including waveplates, mirrors, retroreflectors, etc. To address such technique challenges, we have proposed a beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT entirely based on meta-devices. The key component is a novel multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.29%~93.15%). By leveraging such beam-splitting device as well as reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application has been implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration and large overlapping volume (76.2 mm^3). We believe that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation and computing, etc.</description>

      <title>Realization of the Tellegen Effect in Resonant Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal magnetoelectric effect in isotropic Tellegen materials enables exotic phenomena such as axion-modified electrodynamics and fosters the development of magnet-free nonreciprocal media. Although predicted over 75 years ago and observed in only a handful of natural materials with very low strength, the strong optical Tellegen effect has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a resonant optical isotropic Tellegen effect in a metasurface, showcasing a response that is 100 times greater than that of any known natural material. This optical metasurface, consisting of randomly distributed cobalt-silicon nanoscatterers with strong shape anisotropy, utilizes spontaneous magnetization to achieve a robust Tellegen effect without the need for an external magnetic field. In addition to the Tellegen response, the metasurface exhibits both gyroelectric and gyromagnetic effects, contributing to nonreciprocal cross-polarized light reflection. We introduce a technique to independently extract the amplitudes of these three effects using conventional magneto-optical single-side illumination measurements. The observation of the resonant Tellegen effects in the optical frequency range may lead to the experimental observation of axionic electrodynamics and compact bias-free nonreciprocal optical devices.</description>

      <title>Microwave One-way Transparency by Large Synthetic Motion of Magnetochiral Polaritons in Metamolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe microwave one-way transparency via ultrastrongly-coupled magnetochiral polaritons (MChPs) in a metamolecule with simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries at room temperature. The experimental results are reproduced well via numerical simulations. Effective polarizability tensor analyses of the simulation results verify that the one-way transparency is traced back to massive synthetic motion of MChPs. This study paves a way to hybrid quantum systems and synthetic gauge fields using metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A spatiotemporal couplings perspective on harmonic vortices generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with matter serves as a fundamental tool for probing material properties across a wide range of energy regimes. Recent breakthroughs in tailoring the topology of coherent electromagnetic fields have opened new avenues for exploring how matter uniquely responds to the topological characteristics of light. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) beams. We demonstrate how distinct STOV configurations imprint their signature on the HHG process and show that the intensity distribution of harmonic fields can be precisely controlled by tuning the beam parameters. Furthermore, by bridging microscopic calculations with far-field observations, we establish the consistency of our findings and offer fresh insights into this emerging nonlinear spatiotemporal regime.</description>

      <title>MixFunn: A Neural Network for Differential Equations with Improved Generalization and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MixFunn, a novel neural network architecture designed to solve differential equations with enhanced precision, interpretability, and generalization capability. The architecture comprises two key components: the mixed-function neuron, which integrates multiple parameterized nonlinear functions to improve representational flexibility, and the second-order neuron, which combines a linear transformation of its inputs with a quadratic term to capture cross-combinations of input variables. These features significantly enhance the expressive power of the network, enabling it to achieve comparable or superior results with drastically fewer parameters and a reduction of up to four orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. We applied MixFunn in a physics-informed setting to solve differential equations in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving higher accuracy and improved generalization to regions outside the training domain relative to standard machine learning models. Furthermore, the architecture facilitates the extraction of interpretable analytical expressions, offering valuable insights into the underlying solutions.</description>

      <title>3D Heterogeneous Integration of Silicon Nitride and Aluminum Nitride on Sapphire toward Ultra-wideband Photonics Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending two-dimensional photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to three-dimensional (3D) configurations promises great potential for scaling up integration, enhancing functionality, and improving performance of PICs. Silicon-based 3D PICs have made substantial progress due to CMOS compatibility. However, the narrow bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV) limits their use in short-wavelength applications, such as chemical and biological sensing, underwater optical communications, and optical atomic clocks. In this work, we developed a 3D photonics platform by heterogeneously integrating silicon nitride (SiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) PICs on sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$). The broadband transparency of these materials allow our platform to operate over a multi-octave wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. Leveraging this platform, we demonstrated efficient optical nonlinearity in an AlN microcavity, low-loss and tunable SiN waveguide-based optical components, and optical linking between AlN and SiN PICs layers in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, hinting at potential applications in integrated quantum systems. Our work presents an ultra-wideband 3D PICs platform, providing new opportunities for broadband and short-wavelength applications of PICs.</description>

      <title>Cracking Down on Fracture to Functionalise Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel relationship between topology and damage propagation in Maxwell lattices that redefines fracture as a functional design feature rather than mere degradation. We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localise along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings -- validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments -- advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy. This work paves the way for further exploration of topology-driven phenomena in mechanical systems and promises a new direction in the design of robust materials.</description>

Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Toggle Switching is observed in CoHo and CoDy alloys single layers. An original reversal mechanism is reported which contrasts with those observed to date. It is shown that the reversal process is on the {\mu}s timescale involving the reorganization / coalescence of domains and domain walls. The toggle switching is explained considering the unbalanced magnetization distribution stabilized after the ultrashort laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Transforming Siliconization into Slippery Liquid-like Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Siliconization is widely used as a coating technique to engineer surface properties, such as in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to lubricate motion, ensure complete dispensation of product, and to inhibit protein adsorption and biofilm growth. In the hitherto unconnected literature, there has recently been significant progress in understanding the concept of surfaces slippery to liquids. Whereas in the siliconization industry the wettability of surfaces focuses on the hydrophobicity, as measured by contact angle and surface energy, for surfaces slippery to liquids the focus is on the contact angle hysteresis (droplet-on-solid static friction). Moreover, it has been discovered that surfaces with similar static wetting properties can have dramatically different droplet kinetic friction. Here, we report a simple-to-apply coating method to create ultra-low contact angle hysteresis liquid-like coatings for glass (G), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyurethane (PU), and stainless steel (SS); materials that are used for pharmaceutical/parenteral packaging and medical equipment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the coating's slow sliding dynamics surface properties for water droplets, which indicate high droplet kinetic friction, can be converted into fast sliding dynamics, which indicate low droplet kinetic friction, by a simple molecular capping (methylation) process. Our results provide new insight into key aspects of siliconization coatings in the context of industrial/commercial processes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical characterization of a membrane with an on-chip loss shield in a cryogenic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and viceversa, paves the way to novel technologies which exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once that its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18 mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1 K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>

Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Although previous simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to variations in HfO2, experimental validation remains limited. Here, we experimentally investigate variations in remanent polarization (PR) of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors across different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of the standard deviation of PR with VSET peaking around coercive voltage (VC), which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. In the low- and high-VSET regions, PR variations are primarily dictated by saturation polarization (PS) variations, mainly originating from charge trap effects at the interface between the FE-dielectric (DE) layer and the polycrystallinity of FE. On the other hand, in the mid-VSET region peak, the PR variations are attributed to the VC variation, which comes from a combined effect of multi-domain (MD) P switching and polycrystallinity. Notably, sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation amplifies the variations, resulting in a peak of PR variations in this VSET range. Further, we observe that as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled, the non-monotonicity in variations with VSET is reduced, primarily due to reduced domain nucleation and smaller grain sizes. We experimentally establish a strong correlation of PR with PS in the low- and high-VSET regions and with VC in the mid-VSET region across various TFE. Finally, our experimental findings are corroborated with simulations using a 3D phase-field model.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>

Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>
