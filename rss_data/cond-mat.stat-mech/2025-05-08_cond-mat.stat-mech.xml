      <title>Study of the Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a wedge geometry: First-Passage Statistics under Stochastic Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffusion process in the presence of stochastic resetting inside a two-dimensional wedge of top angle $\alpha$, bounded by two infinite absorbing edges. In the absence of resetting, the second moment of the first-passage time diverges for $\alpha&gt;\pi/4$ while it remains finite for $\alpha&lt;\pi/4$, resulting in an unbounded or bounded coefficient of variation in the respective angular regimes. Upon introducing stochastic resetting, we analyze the first-passage properties in both cases and identify the geometric configurations in which resetting consistently enhances the rate of absorption or escape through the boundaries. By deriving the expressions for the probability currents and conditional first-passage quantities such as splitting probabilities and conditional mean first-passage times, we demonstrate how resetting can be employed to bias the escape pathway through the favorable boundary. Our theoretical predictions are verified through Langevin-type numerical simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior Analysis of Pure Dipolar Triangular Lattice via Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films and 2D arrays of magnetic nanoparticles exhibit unique physical properties that make them valuable for a wide range of technological applications. In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in determining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and long-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC) methods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that the critical exponents are very close to those of the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Replica exchange nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested sampling (NS) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring thermodynamic properties in materials science. However, its efficiency is often hindered by the limitations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In strongly multimodal landscapes, MCMC struggles to traverse energy barriers, leading to biased sampling and reduced accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce replica-exchange nested sampling (RENS), a novel enhancement that integrates replica-exchange moves into the NS framework. Inspired by Hamiltonian replica exchange methods, RENS connects independent NS simulations performed under different external conditions, facilitating ergodic sampling and significantly improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RENS using four test systems of increasing complexity: a one-dimensional toy system, periodic Lennard-Jones, the two-scale core-softened Jagla model and a machine learned interatomic potential for silicon. Our results show that RENS not only accelerates convergence but also allows the effective handling of challenging cases where independent NS fails, thereby expanding the applicability of NS to more realistic material models.</description>

      <title>Accelerated escape dynamics in non-Markovian stochastic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional vision sensors based on catadioptric systems with discrete infrared photoreceptors for swarm robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we fabricated and studied two designs for omnidirectional vision sensors for swarm robotics, based on catadioptric systems consisting of a mirror with rotational symmetry, eight discrete infrared photodiodes and a single LED, in order to provide localization and navigation abilities for mobile robotic agents. We considered two arrangements for the photodiodes: one in which they point upward into the mirror, and one in which they point outward, perpendicular to the mirror. To determine which design offers a better field of view on the plane, as well as detection of distance and orientation between two agents, we developed a test rail with three degrees of freedom to experimentally and systematically measure the signal registered by the photodiodes of a given sensor (in a single readout) from the light emitted by another as functions of the distance and orientation. Afterwards, we processed and analyzed the experimental data to develop mathematical models for the mean response of a photodiode in each design. Finally, by numerically inverting the models, we compared the two designs in terms of their accuracy. Our results show that the design with the photodiodes pointing upward resolves better the distance, while the other resolves better the orientation of the emitting agent, both providing an omnidirectional field of view.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and anti-tunneling across entropic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum particle in a constricted two-dimensional channel and analyze how the onset of quantum corrections impacts the (semi-)classical high-temperature behaviour, as temperature is lowered. We characterize both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (transport) properties of the system, considering the case of a narrow and disorder-free channel. Counterintuitively, we find that quantum corrections do not monotonically enhance the particle current as the temperature is lowered, as naively expected from the activation of coherent tunnelling, but they rather inhibit transport at intermediate temperatures, increasing the effective free-energy barrier. We illustrate this ``anti-tunnelling'' effect numerically by computing the non-equilibrium steady-state of a quantum master equation describing the system, and confirm it analytically by adopting the Quantum Smoluchowski limit.</description>

      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Magnetization-resolved density of states and quasi-first order transition in the two-dimensional random bond Ising model: an entropic sampling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with quenched disorder possess complex energy landscapes that are challenging to explore under the conventional Monte Carlo method. In this work, we implement an efficient entropy sampling scheme for accurate computation of the entropy function in low-energy regions. The method is applied to the two-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model, where frustration is controlled by the fraction $p$ of ferromagnetic bonds. We investigate the low-temperature paramagnetic--ferromagnetic phase boundary below the multicritical point at $T_N = 0.9530(4)$, $P_N = 0.89078(8)$, as well as the zero-temperature ferromagnetic--spin-glass transition. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that the phase boundary for $T &lt; T_N$ exhibits reentrant behavior. By analyzing the evolution of the magnetization-resolved density of states $g(E, M)$ and ground-state spin configurations against increasing frustration, we provide strong evidence that the zero-temperature transition is quasi-first order. Finite-size scaling conducted on the spin-glass side supports the validity of $\beta = 0$, with a correlation length exponent $\nu = 1.50(8)$. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the ferromagnetic-to-spin-glass phase transition in an extensively degenerate ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the normal mode analysis on the linearized Boltzmann equation for massive particles in the relaxation time approximation. One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled masses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels decrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically derive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the long-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless dissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the massive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous branch cut.</description>

      <title>A disturbance in the force. How force fluctuations hinder dynamical friction and induce core stalling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical friction is an important phenomena in stellar dynamics resulting in the slowing down of a test particle upon many two-body scatters with background particles. Chandrasekhar's original formulation, developed for idealized infinite and homogeneous systems, has been found to be sufficiently accurate even in models of finite extent and radially dependent density profiles. However, in some cases $N-$body simulations evidenced a breakdown of Chandrasekhar's formalism. In particular, in the case of cored stellar systems, the analytical predictions underestimate the rate of in-fall of the test particle. Several explanations for such discrepancy have been proposed so far, in spite of this it remains unclear whether the origin is a finite N effect or an effect arising from the resonance of the orbits of the test and field particles, which is independent on $N$, such as dynamical buoyancy. Here we aim at shedding some light on this issue with tailored numerical experiments. We perform ad hoc simulations of a massive tracer initially placed on a low eccentricity orbit in spherical equilibrium models with increasing resolution. We use an $N-$body code where the self-consistent interaction among the background particles can be substituted with the effect of the static smooth potential of the system's continuum limit, so that the higher order contributions to the dynamical friction arising from the formation of a wake can be neglected if needed. We find that, contrary to what reported in the previous literature, a suppression of dynamical friction happens in both cuspy and cored models. When neglecting the interaction among field particles we observe in both cases a clear $N^{-1/2}$ scaling of the radius at which dynamical friction ceases to be effective. This hints towards a granularity-induced origin of the so-called core-stalling of the massive tracer in cored models.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.</description>

Abstract: Materials that have zero-energy flat band states on the surface are likely to show surface superconductivity. Here we report a theoretical observation that a Hamiltonian describing a thin slab of topological nodal line semimetal, has zero energy eigenstate spanning the entire surface under certain conditions, namely (i) the hopping probability of fermions in the direction of thickness is more than that in other directions (ii) the onsite interaction should be less than some limiting value determined by the hopping probability. Our claim is substantiated by analytic and numerical approach. We also report new phase transitions in a region of parameter space and indicate that the Hamiltonian can also be realised by stacked layers described by Kitaev model on honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing Markov dynamics by linking nonequilibrium thermodynamics with information geometry. Using the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence, we reveal an intrinsic Minkowski structure in the parameter space that naturally separates symmetric elements, governed by kinetic activities and forces, from the antisymmetric behavior, characterized by thermodynamic currents and affinities. This formulation offers a systematic approach to probe the transport properties of Markov systems.</description>

      <title>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parameterization of entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the latent heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features, such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves, which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. This approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolates between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

      <title>Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a graph morphology algorithm of invasion percolation, the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation during drainage is calculated. Two topological invariants are identified: The bond percolation threshold and the residual saturation. Bond percolation with trapping is employed to derive a closed-form pressure-saturation relation, expressed in terms of the pore geometry (pore throat distribution) and material parameters (contact angle and interfacial tension), as well as universal exponents and topological invariants, all connected according to scaling relations. The simulations suggest that the exponents of these scaling relations, along with the power-law relations between residual saturation and lattice size, are universal. Conversely, the self-similar relations are non-universal, and the self-similar function of the supercritical regime is governed by the coordination number of the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Transport in multifractal Kraichnan flows: from turbulence to Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of fluid trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection. The model couples a one-dimensional, Gaussian, white-in-time random flow to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting velocity field features an interplay between the roughness exponent $\xi\in(0,2]$, controlling the correlation decay for the Gaussian component, and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in [0,\sqrt {2}/2)$, prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. Recent numerical work by the authors suggests that such coupling induce a smoothing-by-intermittency effect, and the purpose here is to address this phenomenon theoretically. Using the theory of 1D Feller Markov processes, we characterize the phases of the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$, extending to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic and colliding/non-colliding transitions known in the monofractal Kraichnan case. Our analysis distinguishes between two settings: quenched or annealed. In the quenched setting, the GMC realization is prescribed, and we show that the phases are governed by the most probable H\"older exponent of the multifractal velocity field. In the annealed setting, the GMC is averaged over, leading to an additional smoothing effect. Moreover, we show that the separation process exhibits structural analogies with multiplicative one-dimensional versions of the Liouville Brownian motion (LBM)--a diffusion process evolving in a random GMC landscape, originally introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both the quenched and annealed phase transitions are recovered by considering a multiplicative LBM characterized by a roughness parameter $\xi + 4\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>
