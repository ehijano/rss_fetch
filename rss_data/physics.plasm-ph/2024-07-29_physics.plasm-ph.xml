      <title>Transmission characteristics of millimeter and sub-terahertz channels through spatially ripple plasma sheath layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of millimeter wave (MMW) and sub-terahertz (THz) signals through plasma sheaths is a critical concern for maintaining communication with hypersonic vehicles, yet the impact of complex plasma structures on these high-frequency channels remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to characterize the transmission properties of MMW and sub-THz waves through plasma sheaths with various density profiles and ripple structures, addressing the gap in knowledge regarding the effects of plasma inhomogeneities on signal propagation. We employ an approach combining Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) data with transfer matrix methods (TMM) to model propagation through both flat and rippled plasma layers. Our findings reveal that ripple structures in plasma sheaths significantly affect channel performance, with periodic ripples reducing cutoff frequency and introducing frequency-selective behavior, while random ripples cause more unpredictable transmission characteristics. Our results explore the impact of the arrangement of plasma density layers and the parameters of ripple structures (period and amplitude) on channel transmission, group velocity dispersion, and angular dependence of wave propagation. These results provide crucial insights for the design and optimization of communication systems for hypersonic vehicles, potentially enabling the development of adaptive technologies capable of maintaining reliable communication in complex plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport regimes in the presence of an X-point magnetic configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of the two-dimensional electrostatic turbulence characterizing the edge of a Tokamak device from the study of test particles motion (passive fluid tracers) following the EXB drift. We perform statistical tests on the tracer population in order to assess both the magnitude and the main features of transport. The role of other physical properties, such as viscosity and inverse energy cascade in the spectrum, is also considered. We outline that large scale eddies are responsible for greater transport coefficients, while the presence of an X-point magnetic field reduces the mean free path of the particles, however generating a larger outliers population with respect to a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Application of interpretable machine learning for cross-diagnostic inference on the ST40 spherical tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are exceptionally effective in capturing complex non-linear relationships of high-dimensional datasets and making accurate predictions. However, their intrinsic ``black-box'' nature makes it difficult to interpret them or guarantee ``safe behavior'' when deployed in high-risk applications such as feedback control, healthcare and finance. This drawback acts as a significant barrier to their wider application across many scientific and industrial domains where the interpretability of the model predictions is as important as accuracy. Leveraging the latest developments in interpretable machine learning, we develop a method to parameterise ``black-box'' models, effectively transforming them into ``grey-box'' models. We apply this approach to plasma diagnostics by creating a parameterised synthetic Soft X-Ray imaging $-$ Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which predicts high temporal resolution electron temperature and density profiles from the measured soft X-ray emission. The ``grey-box'' model predictions are benchmarked against the trained ``black-box'' models as well as a diverse range of plasma conditions. Our model-agnostic approach can be applied to various machine learning architectures, enabling direct comparisons of model interpretations.</description>

      <title>Cross-Calibration and First Vertical ECE Measurement of Electron Energy Distribution in the TCV Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the first Vertical Electron Cyclotron Emission (V-ECE) measurement of non-thermal electron distributions in the \textit{Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable}, TCV. These measurements were conducted in runaway electron scenarios and in the presence of Electron Cyclotron Current Drive. Measured intensities of linearly polarised X- and O-mode radiation from fast electrons allow the analysis of the energy distribution. The measurements were made possible through the creation of an operational regime for the diagnostic that is free of thermal background radiation, in relaxed electron density operations. This operational regime notably enables the cross-calibration of the diagnostic system, relying on thermal plasma measurements and modeling with the ray-tracing code SPECE.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method for mixed-frame multigroup radiation-hydrodynamics with GPU acceleration implemented in the QUOKKA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-frame formulations of radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD), where the radiation quantities are computed in an inertial frame but matter quantities are in a comoving frame, are advantageous because they admit algorithms that conserve energy and momentum to machine precision and combine more naturally with adaptive mesh techniques, since unlike pure comoving-frame methods they do not face the problem that radiation quantities must change frame every time a cell is refined or coarsened. However, implementing multigroup RHD in a mixed-frame formulation presents challenges due to the complexity of handling frequency-dependent interactions and the Doppler shift of radiation boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for multigroup RHD that integrates a mixed-frame formulation with a piecewise powerlaw approximation for frequency dependence within groups. This approach ensures the exact conservation of total energy and momentum while effectively managing the Lorentz transformation of group boundaries and evaluation of group-averaged opacities. Our method takes advantage of the locality of matter-radiation coupling, allowing the source term for $N_g$ frequency groups to be handled with simple equations with a sparse Jacobian matrix of size $N_g + 1$, which can be inverted with $O(N_g)$ complexity. This results in a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N_g$ and requires no more communication than a pure hydrodynamics update, making it highly efficient for massively parallel and GPU-based systems. We implement our method in the GPU-accelerated RHD code QUOKKA and demonstrate that it passes a wide range of numerical tests. We demonstrate that the piecewise powerlaw method shows significant advantages over traditional opacity averaging methods for handling rapidly variable opacities with modest frequency resolution.</description>

      <title>Steering laser-produced THz radiation in air with superluminal ionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a single-color ultrashort optical pulse propagating in air can emit THz radiation along any direction with respect to its propagation axis. The emission angle can be adjusted by the flying focus technique which determines the speed and direction of the ionization front. When the ionization front velocity becomes superluminal, the THz emission corresponds to classical Cherenkov radiation.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic flux-driven simulations in mixed TEM/ITG regime using a delta-f PIC scheme with evolving background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of global gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence using a Particle-In-Cell framework, verifying the delta-f assumption with a fixed background distribution becomes challenging when determining quasi-steady state profiles corresponding to given sources over long time scales, where plasma profiles can evolve significantly. The advantage of low relative sampling noise afforded by the delta-f scheme is shown to be retained by considering the background as a time-evolving Maxwellian with time-dependent density and temperature profiles. Implementation of this adaptive scheme to simulate electrostatic collisionless flux-driven turbulence in tokamak plasmas show small and non-increasing sampling noise levels, which would otherwise increase indefinitely with a stationary background scheme. The adaptive scheme furthermore allows one to reach numerically converged results of quasi-steady state with much lower marker numbers.</description>
