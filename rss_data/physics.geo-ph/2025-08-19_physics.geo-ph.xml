      <title>SPIDER: Scalable Probabilistic Inference for Differential Earthquake Relocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismicity catalogs are larger than ever due to an explosion of techniques for enhanced earthquake detection and an abundance of high-quality datasets. Bayesian inference is a popular framework for locating earthquakes due to its ability to propagate and quantify uncertainty into the inversion results, but traditional methods do not scale well to high-dimensional parameter spaces, making them unsuitable for double-difference relocation where the number of parameters can reach the millions. Here we introduce SPIDER, a scalable Bayesian inference framework for double difference hypocenter relocation. SPIDER uses a physics-informed neural network Eikonal solver together with a highly efficient sampler called Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics to generate posterior samples for entire seismicity catalogs jointly. It is readily parallelized over multiple GPUs for enhanced computational efficiency. We demonstrate the capabilities of SPIDER on a rigorous synthetic seismicity catalog and three real data catalogs from California and Japan. We introduce several ways to analyze high-dimensional posterior distributions to aid in scientific interpretation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for ultra-water-rich ammonia hydrates stabilized in icy exoplanetary mantles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>Geological Everything Model 3D: A Physics-informed Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.
