      <title>When Algorithms Mirror Minds: A Confirmation-Aware Social Dynamic Model of Echo Chamber and Homogenization Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems increasingly suffer from echo chambers and user homogenization, systemic distortions arising from the dynamic interplay between algorithmic recommendations and human behavior. While prior work has studied these phenomena through the lens of algorithmic bias or social network structure, we argue that the psychological mechanisms of users and the closed-loop interaction between users and recommenders are critical yet understudied drivers of these emergent effects. To bridge this gap, we propose the Confirmation-Aware Social Dynamic Model which incorporates user psychology and social relationships to simulate the actual user and recommender interaction process. Our theoretical analysis proves that echo chambers and homogenization traps, defined respectively as reduced recommendation diversity and homogenized user representations, will inevitably occur. We also conduct extensive empirical simulations on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset with five well-designed metrics, exploring the root factors influencing the aforementioned phenomena from three level perspectives: the stochasticity and social integration degree of recommender (system-level), the psychological mechanisms of users (user-level), and the dataset scale (platform-level). Furthermore, we demonstrate four practical mitigation strategies that help alleviate echo chambers and user homogenization at the cost of some recommendation accuracy. Our findings provide both theoretical and empirical insights into the emergence and drivers of echo chambers and user homogenization, as well as actionable guidelines for human-centered recommender design.</description>

      <title>E-CaTCH: Event-Centric Cross-Modal Attention with Temporal Consistency and Class-Imbalance Handling for Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Roots of International Perceptions: Simulating US Attitude Changes Towards China with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.</description>

      <title>Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Framework for Evaluating Geodesic Distances Between Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a spectral framework for quantifying the differentiation between graph data samples by introducing a novel metric named Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD). For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs of different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the larger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, and the mixing time of random walks. Through extensive experiments comparing with state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD), the proposed GGD metric demonstrates significantly improved performance for graph classification, particularly when only partial node features are available. Furthermore, we extend the application of GGD beyond graph classification to stability analysis of GNNs and the quantification of distances between datasets, highlighting its versatility in broader machine learning contexts.</description>
