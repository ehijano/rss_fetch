      <title>Uniqueness and Existence of Linear Equilibrium with a Constrained Trader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time financial market with a single constrained trader, competitive market makers, and noise traders. Within the class of linear equilibria, the equilibrium structure is shown to be uniquely determined by two state variables: the market maker's expectation of the trader's remaining demand and the residual demand beyond this expectation. This discrete-time uniqueness result aligns with its continuous-time analogue, indicating that the latter may emerge as the unique limit within the same class. We also prove the existence of a linear equilibrium, providing formal support to numerical and empirical findings in related work.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Gini indices: An axiomatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Via an axiomatic approach, we characterize the family of n-th order Gini deviation, defined as the expected range over n independent draws from a distribution, to quantify joint dispersion across multiple observations. This extends the classical Gini deviation, which relies solely on pairwise comparisons. Our generalization grows increasingly sensitive to tail inequality as n increases, offering a more nuanced view of distributional extremes. We show that these higher-order Gini deviations admit a Choquet integral representation, inheriting the desirable properties of coherent deviation measures. Furthermore, we prove that both the n-th order Gini deviation and its normalized version, the n-th order Gini coefficient, are n-observation elicitable, facilitating rigorous backtesting. Empirical analysis using World Inequality Database data reveals that higher-order Gini coefficients detect disparities obscured by the classical Gini coefficient, particularly in cases of extreme income or wealth concentration. Our results establish higher-order Gini indices as valuable complementary tools for robust inequality assessment.</description>

      <title>On data-driven robust distortion risk measures for non-negative risks with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by proposing two new kinds of distributional uncertainty sets, we explore robustness of distortion risk measures against distributional uncertainty. To be precise, we first consider a distributional uncertainty set which is characterized solely by a ball determined by general Wasserstein distance centered at certain empirical distribution function, and then further consider additional constraints of known first moment and any other higher moment of the underlying loss distribution function. Under the assumption that the distortion function is strictly concave and twice differentiable, and that the underlying loss random variable is non-negative and bounded, we derive closed-form expressions for the distribution functions which maximize a given distortion risk measure over the distributional uncertainty sets respectively. Moreover, we continue to study the general case of a concave distortion function and unbounded loss random variables. Comparisons with existing studies are also made. Finally, we provide a numerical study to illustrate the proposed models and results. Our work provides a novel generalization of several known achievements in the literature.</description>
