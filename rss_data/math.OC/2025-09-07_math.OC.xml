      <title>Universal Representation of Generalized Convex Functions and their Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to a wide range of optimization problems, from optimal transport theory to mathematical economics, often take the form of generalized convex functions (GCFs). This characterization can be used to convert nested bilevel optimization problems into single-level optimization problems. Despite this, the characterization has not been fully exploited in numerical optimization.
  When the solution to an optimization problem is known to belong to a particular class of objects, this information can be leveraged by parameterizing that class of objects and optimizing over this parameterization. The hallmark of a good parameterization is the Universal Approximation Property (UAP): that is, the parameterization approximates any object in the class arbitrarily well. For example, neural networks satisfy the UAP with respect to the class of continuous functions.
  Building on the literature concerned with the parameterization of convex functions, we extend these ideas to GCFs. We present a convex and potentially one-to-one parameterization of GCFs and their gradients that satisfies the UAP. We also compare this class to shallow neural networks and highlight their shared characteristics.
  The ideas pursued here have been implemented in the Python package \href{https://github.com/MoeenNehzati/gconvex}{\texttt{gconvex}}, available online. Using it, we tackle the problem of finding the revenue-maximizing auction for multiple goods and demonstrate how our parameterization can effectively solve this problem.</description>

      <title>Alignment Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces alignment games, a new class of zero-sum games modeling strategic interventions where effectiveness depends on alignment with an underlying hidden state. Motivated by operational problems in medical diagnostics, economic sanctions, and resource allocation, this framework features two players, a Hider and a Searcher, who choose subsets of a given space. Payoffs are determined by their misalignment (symmetric difference), explicitly modeling the trade-off between commission errors (unnecessary action) and omission errors (missed targets), given by a cost function and a penalty function, respectively.
  We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form equilibrium solutions that contain interesting mathematical properties based on the game's payoff structure. When cost and penalty functions are unequal, optimal strategies are consistently governed by cost-penalty ratios. On the unit circle, optimal arc lengths are direct functions of this ratio, and in discrete games, optimal choice probabilities are proportional to element-specific ratios.
  When costs are equal, the solutions exhibit rich structural properties and sharp threshold behaviors. On the unit interval, this manifests as a geometric pattern of minimal covering versus maximal non-overlapping strategies. In discrete games with cardinality constraints, play concentrates on the highest-cost locations, with solutions changing discontinuously as parameters cross critical values.
  Our framework extends the theory of geometric and search games and is general enough that classical models, such as Matching Pennies, emerge as special cases. These results provide a new theoretical foundation for analyzing the strategic tension between comprehensive coverage and precise targeting under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Driven Adaptive Surrogate Modeling for Simulation and Optimization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a surrogate model refinement approach for the simulation of dynamical systems and the solution of optimization problems governed by dynamical systems in which surrogates replace expensive-to-compute state- and control-dependent component functions in the dynamics or objective function. For example, trajectory simulation and optimization tasks for an aircraft depend on aerodynamic coefficient functions whose evaluation requires expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations for every value of the state and control encountered in simulation and optimization algorithms, which would result in prohibitively long run times, often exacerbated further by the lack of derivative information. To overcome this bottleneck, this work employs differentiable surrogates that are computed from values of the true component functions at a few points. The proposed approach updates the current surrogates on an as-needed basis as follows: given a surrogate and corresponding solution of the simulation or optimization problem, the approach combines solution sensitivity information with pointwise error estimates between the true component functions and their surrogates to define an acquisition function that is used to determine new points at which to evaluate the true component function to refine the surrogate. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of a notional hypersonic vehicle with aerodynamic coefficient models that are approximated using kernel interpolation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Damping for the 1D Wave Equation Using a Single Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational structures are susceptible to catastrophic failures or structural damages when external forces induce resonances or repeated unwanted oscillations. One common mitigation strategy is to use dampers to suppress these disturbances. This leads to the problem of finding optimal damper viscosities and positions for a given vibrational structure. Although extensive research exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper positions remains challenging due to its discrete nature. To overcome this, we introduce a novel model for the damped wave equation (at the PDE level) with a damper of viscosity $\mathfrak{g}$ at position $\mathfrak{p}$ and develop a system-theoretic input/output-based analysis in the frequency domain. In this system-theoretic formulation, while we consider average displacement as the output, for input (forcing), we analyze two separate cases, namely, the uniform and boundary forcing. For both cases, explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding transfer functions, parametrized by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. This explicit parametrization by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ facilitates analyzing the optimal damping problem (at the PDE level) using norms such as the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norms. We also examine limiting cases, such as when the viscosity is very large or when no external damping is present. To illustrate our approach, we present numerical examples, compare different optimization criteria, and discuss the impact of damping parameters on the damped wave equation.</description>

      <title>Low degree sum-of-squares bounds for the stability number: a copositive approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability number of a graph $G$, denoted as $\alpha(G)$, is the maximum size of an independent (stable) set in $G$. Semidefinite programming (SDP) methods, which originated from Lov\'asz's theta number and expanded through lift-and-project hierarchies as well as sums of squares (SOS) relaxations, provide powerful tools for approximating $\alpha(G)$.
  We build upon the copositive formulation of $\alpha(G)$ and introduce a novel SDP-based hierarchy of inner approximations to the copositive cone COP$_n$, which is derived from structured SOS representations. This hierarchy preserves essential structural properties that are missing in existing approaches, offers an SDP feasibility formulation at each level despite its non-convexity, and converges finitely to $\alpha(G)$. Our results include examples of graph families that require at least $\alpha(G) - 1$ levels for related hierarchies, indicating the tightness of the de Klerk-Pasechnik conjecture. Notably, on those graph families, our hierarchy achieves $\alpha(G)$ in a single step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal charging strategy for large-scale electric vehicles in smart grids using a finite-horizon framework within a mean field game approach. By proving the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the consistency condition equation, we analyze the optimal charging strategies for electric vehicles in the mean field limit case. We then construct the approximate optimal charging strategies for a finite number of vehicles in both non-cooperative and cooperative games, and give a numerical experiment accordingly. Lastly, we present numerical analyses to illustrate approximate strategies of non-cooperate and cooperate game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual information (MI) between two random variables is an important correlation measure in data analysis. The Shannon entropy of a joint probability distribution is the variable part under fixed marginals. We aim to minimize and maximize it to obtain the largest and smallest MI possible in this case, leading to a scaled MI ratio for better comparability. We present algorithmic approaches and optimal solutions for a set of problem instances based on data from molecular evolution. We show that this allows us to construct a sensible, systematic correction to raw MI values.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making dynamics in hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes a collective decision-making dynamical process in a multiagent system under the assumption of cooperative higher-order interactions within the community, modeled as a hypernetwork. The nonlinear interconnected system is characterized by saturated nonlinearities that describe how agents transmit their opinion state to their neighbors in the hypernetwork, and by a bifurcation parameter representing the community's social effort. We show that the presence of higher-order interactions leads to the unfolding of a pitchfork bifurcation, introducing an interval for the social effort parameter in which the system exhibits bistability. With equilibrium points representing collective decisions, this implies that, depending on the initial conditions, the community will either remain in a deadlock state (with the origin as the equilibrium point) or reach a nontrivial decision. A numerical example is given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Model predictive quantum control: A modular approach for efficient and robust quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful modern control methods. It relies on repeatedly solving a finite-horizon optimal control problem and applying the beginning piece of the optimal input. In this paper, we develop a modular framework for improving efficiency and robustness of quantum optimal control (QOC) via MPC. We first provide a tutorial introduction to basic concepts of MPC from a QOC perspective. We then present multiple MPC schemes, ranging from simple approaches to more sophisticated schemes which admit stability guarantees. This yields a modular framework which can be used 1) to improve efficiency of open-loop QOC and 2) to improve robustness of closed-loop quantum control by incorporating feedback. We demonstrate these benefits with numerical results, where we benchmark the proposed methods against competing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a stochastic analysis of an overlapping-generations model under incomplete markets. By casting individual optimisation with idiosyncratic income risk into a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) system, we (i) establish existence and uniqueness of the dynamic general-equilibirum interest rate and (ii) derive semi-explicit formulas for both the equilibrium interest rate path and the natural borrowing limit - defined as the discounted expected shortfall of future income. Our FBSDE-based approach yields tractable policy functions and equilibrium mappings without relying on high-dimensional PDE methods, offering clear insights into how income dynamics and demographic structure drive intereate-rate fluctuations and credit constraints.</description>

      <title>Resolving Tangling in Multi-Conformer Refinement via Iterative Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of advanced crystallographic techniques has shifted structural biology from static, single-conformer models toward probing protein dynamics. Extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps requires both high-resolution data and refinement algorithms capable of handling conformational heterogeneity. However, current refinement protocols often fail due to the tangling phenomenon, in which conformational states become improperly intertwined during optimization. Here, we present an automated refinement methodology based on iterative projections within the divide-and-concur framework. This approach enables seamless integration of geometric constraints with experimental density constraints derived from observed scattering amplitudes. By allowing each atom to satisfy density constraints independently, we show that this framework effectively circumvents tangling artifacts and achieves robust refinement performance, even for models initialized with R-factors as high as 12%. Just as iterative projections revolutionized phase retrieval in crystallography, we demonstrate that they can also address the optimization challenges in multi-conformational refinement. This work establishes a computational foundation for advancing crystallographic methodologies to resolve conformational heterogeneity and ultimately capture protein dynamics at atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Vertex-ordering and arc-partitioning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vertex-ordering problems in loop-free digraphs subject to constraints on the left-going arcs, focusing on existence conditions and computational complexity. As an intriguing special case, we explore vertex-specific lower and upper bounds on the left-outdegrees and right-indegrees. We show, for example, that deciding whether the left-going arcs can form an in-branching is solvable in polynomial time and provide a necessary and sufficient condition, while the analogous problem for an in-arborescence turns out to be NP-complete. We also consider a weighted variant that enforces vertex-specific lower and upper bounds on the weighted left-outdegrees, which is particularly relevant in applications. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between ordering problems and their arc-partitioning counterparts, where one seeks to partition the arcs into a subgraph from a specific digraph family and an acyclic subgraph -- equivalently, one seeks to cover all directed cycles with a subgraph belonging to a specific family. For the family of in-branchings, unions of disjoint dipaths, and matchings, the two formulations coincide, whereas for in-arborescences, dipaths, Hamiltonian dipaths, and perfect matchings the formulations diverge. Our results yield a comprehensive complexity landscape, unify diverse special cases and variants, clarify the algorithmic boundaries of ordered digraphs, and relate them to broader topics including graph degeneracy, acyclic orientations, influence propagation, and rank aggregation.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for the Navier-Stokes equations and identification of immersed obstacles in the Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical and numerical investigation of object detection in a fluid governed by the three-dimensional evolutionary Navier--Stokes equations. To solve this inverse problem, we assume that interior velocity measurements are available only within a localized subregion of the fluid domain. First, we present an identifiability result. We then formulate the problem as a shape optimization task: to identify the obstacle, we minimize a nonlinear least-squares criterion with a regularization term that penalizes the perimeter of the obstacle to be identified. We prove the existence and stability of a minimizer of the least-squares functional. To recover the unknown obstacle, we present a non-iterative identification method based on the topological derivative. The corresponding asymptotic expansion of the least-squares functional is computed in a straightforward manner using a penalty method. Finally, as a realistic application, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed non-iterative procedure through numerical experiments using the INSTMCOTRHD ocean model, which incorporates realistic Mediterranean bathymetry, stratification, and forcing conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning to accelerate distributed ADMM using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks (GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's convergence properties.

      <title>On the convergence of the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When does a variational quantum algorithm converge to a globally optimal problem solution? Despite the large literature around variational approaches to quantum computing, the answer is largely unknown. We address this open question by developing a convergence theory for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). By leveraging the terminology of quantum control landscapes, we prove a sufficient criterion that characterizes when convergence to a ground state of a Hamiltonian can be guaranteed for almost all initial parameter settings. More specifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows for moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded manner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates, then the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop constructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two commonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\"atze. Finally, we discuss regularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as for condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem.</description>

      <title>Global weight optimization of frame structures under free-vibration eigenvalue constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization of frame structures under free-vibration eigenvalue constraints constitutes a challenging nonconvex polynomial optimization problem with disconnected feasible sets. In this article, we first formulate it as a polynomial semidefinite programming problem (SDP) of minimizing a linear function over a basic semi-algebraic feasible set. We then propose to solve this problem by Lasserre hierarchy of linear semidefinite relaxations providing a sequence of increasing lower bounds. To obtain also a sequence of upper bounds and thus conditions on global $\varepsilon$-optimality, we provide a bilevel reformulation that exhibits a special structure: The lower level is quasiconvex univariate and it has a non-empty interior if the constraints of the upper-level problem are satisfied. After deriving the conditions for the solvability of the lower-level problem, we thus provide a way to construct feasible points to the original SDP. Using such a feasible point, we modify the original nonlinear SDP to satisfy the conditions for the deployment of the Lasserre hierarchy. Solving arbitrary degree relaxation of the hierarchy, we prove that scaled first-order moments associated with the problem variables satisfy feasibility conditions for the lower-level problem and thus provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the objective function. Using these bounds, we develop a simple sufficient condition for global $\varepsilon$-optimality and prove that the optimality gap $\varepsilon$ converges to zero if the set of global minimizers is convex. Finally, we illustrate these results with four representative problems for which the hierarchy converges in at most five relaxation degrees</description>

      <title>On sensitivities regarding shape and topology optimization as derivatives on Wasserstein spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the framework of optimal transport to the formulation of optimal design problems. By considering the Wasserstein space as a set of design variables, we associate each probability measure with a shape configuration of a material in some ways. In particular, we focus on connections between differentials on the Wasserstein space and sensitivities in the standard setting of shape and topology optimization in order to regard the optimization procedure of those problems as gradient flows on the Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>Gradient Methods with Online Scaling Part I. Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Elastoplasticity with softening as a state-dependent sweeping process: non-uniqueness of solutions and emergence of shear bands in lattices of springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasticity with softening and fracture mechanics lead to ill-posed mathematical problems due to the loss of monotonicity. Multiple co-existing solutions are possible when softening elements are coupled together, and solutions cannot be continued beyond the point of complete degradation of the set of admissible stresses. We present a state-dependent sweeping process which solves the evolution of elasto-plastic Lattice Spring Models with arbitrary placement of softening, hardening and perfectly plastic springs. Using numerical simulations of regular grid lattices with softening we demonstrate the emergence of non-symmetric shear bands with strain localization. At the same time, in toy examples it is easy to analytically derive multiple co-existing solutions. These solutions correspond to fixed points in the implicit catch-up algorithm and we observe a discontinuous bifurcation with the exchange of stability of those fixed points.</description>

      <title>Online Complexity Estimation for Repetitive Scenario Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of repetitive scenario design where one has to solve repeatedly a scenario design problem and can adjust the sample size (number of scenarios) to obtain a desired level of risk (constraint violation probability). We propose an approach to learn on the fly the optimal sample size based on observed data consisting in previous scenario solutions and their risk level. Our approach consists in learning a function that represents the pdf (probability density function) of the risk as a function of the sample size. Once this function is known, retrieving the optimal sample size is straightforward. We prove the soundness and convergence of our approach to obtain the optimal sample size for the class of fixed-complexity scenario problems, which generalizes fully-supported convex scenario programs that have been studied extensively in the scenario optimization literature. We also demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach on a series of challenging repetitive scenario design problems, including non-fixed-complexity problems, nonconvex constraints and time-varying distributions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Range Reduction via Branch-and-Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance computing in machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to the development of specialized hardware accelerators like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A key strategy to enhance these accelerators is the reduction of precision in arithmetic operations, which increases processing speed and lowers latency - crucial for real-time AI applications. Precision reduction minimizes memory bandwidth requirements and energy consumption, essential for large-scale and mobile deployments, and increases throughput by enabling more parallel operations per cycle, maximizing hardware resource utilization. This strategy is equally vital for solving NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems common in machine learning, which often require high precision for accurate representation. Special hardware solvers, such as quantum annealers, benefit significantly from precision reduction. This paper introduces a fully principled Branch-and-Bound algorithm for reducing precision needs in QUBO problems by utilizing dynamic range as a measure of complexity. Experiments validate our algorithm's effectiveness on an actual quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Classical optimization with imaginary time block encoding on quantum computers: The MaxCut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems in finance, physics and computer science are typically very hard to tackle in classical computing and quantum computing could help speed up computations and provide efficient methods for tackling large problems. Typically, to treat the problem with a quantum computer, the optimal solution is cast as the ground state of a diagonal Hamiltonian. We develop a new method, called ITE-BE, based on a recent imaginary time algorithm, which requires no variational parameter optimization as all parameters can be derived analytically from the target Hamiltonian. We also demonstrate that our method can be successfully combined with other quantum algorithms such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). For illustration, here we study the MaxCut problem. We find that the QAOA ansatz increases the post-selection success of ITE-BE, and shallow QAOA circuits, when boosted with ITE-BE, achieve better performance than deeper QAOA circuits. For the special case of the transverse initial state, we adapt our block encoding scheme to allow for a deterministic application of the first layer of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Global Contact-Rich Planning with Sparsity-Rich Semidefinite Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that contact-rich motion planning is also sparsity-rich when viewed as polynomial optimization (POP). We can exploit not only the correlative and term sparsity patterns that are general to all POPs, but also specialized sparsity patterns from the robot kinematic structure and the separability of contact modes. Such sparsity enables the design of high-order but sparse semidefinite programming (SDPs) relaxations--building upon Lasserre's moment and sums of squares hierarchy--that (i) can be solved in seconds by off-the-shelf SDP solvers, and (ii) compute near globally optimal solutions to the nonconvex contact-rich planning problems with small certified suboptimality. Through extensive experiments both in simulation (Push Bot, Push Box, Push Box with Obstacles, and Planar Hand) and real world (Push T), we demonstrate the power of using convex SDP relaxations to generate global contact-rich motion plans. As a contribution of independent interest, we release the Sparse Polynomial Optimization Toolbox (SPOT)--implemented in C++ with interfaces to both Python and Matlab--that automates sparsity exploitation for robotics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits for Exponential Hedging in the Brownian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scaling limits of exponential utility indifference prices for European contingent claims in the Bachelier model. We show that the scaling limit can be represented in terms of the \emph{specific relative entropy}, and in addition we construct asymptotic optimal hedging strategies. To prove the upper bound for the limit, we formulate the dual problem as a stochastic control, and show there exists a classical solution to its Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The proof for the lower bound relies on the duality result for exponential hedging in discrete time.</description>
