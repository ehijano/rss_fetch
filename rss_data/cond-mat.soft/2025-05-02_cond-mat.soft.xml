      <title>Expanding Active Matter to the Third Dimension: Exploring Short and Long-Range Particle-Wall Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most active colloid experiments are quasi-2D. Here a 3D density-matched solution of active particles propelled and aligned with an AC electric field uniquely facilitates measurement of short and long-range particle-wall interactions. Near-wall mobility is reduced by Stokes drag and local electric-field distortion. Long-range attractions concentrate particles at upper and lower walls at a ratio dependent on particle orientation and rate proportional to speed and confinement. This approach may be extended to other active systems to understand particle-wall interactions and non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the dissolution states of a fluorescent probe within a lipid bilayer using molec ular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers (membranes) are closely associated with various cellular functions and are often evaluated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. For instance, by employing fluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane environment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such probes are dissolved within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a deeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the dissolution state of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well as its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous phase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Thin Lubricant Films upon Liquid Contact on Slippery Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, slippery surfaces have attracted significant interest due to their excellent liquid-repellent properties and their potential in diverse commercial applications. Such surfaces are prepared by coating functionalized solid substrates with a thin lubricant film that prevents direct contact between a liquid and the substrate. The morphology of thin films upon liquid contact plays a central role in governing various phenomena, including the coalescence and mobility of liquid droplets, heat transfer efficiency, and the extent of lubricant depletion. However, a detailed understanding of film dynamics upon droplet contact remains limited, both from theoretical and experimental perspectives. Here, by employing principles of fluid dynamics, optics, and surface wetting, we present a comprehensive study that examines both the spatial and temporal variations of lubricant films upon contact with sessile liquid droplets and liquid bridges. Our findings reveal that the film dynamics can be categorized into three distinct stages, each significantly influenced by key system parameters: initial film thickness, three-phase contact line width, and Laplace pressure of liquids. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by optimizing these parameters, it is possible to reverse the lubricant flow in the final stage, thereby causing the liquid to partially lift off from the slippery surface.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact Boltzmann collision operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>

      <title>A one-component patchy-particle icosahedral quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing particles that are able to form icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs) and that are as simple as possible is not only of fundamental interest but is also important to the potential realization of IQCs in materials other than metallic alloys. Here we introduce one-component patchy-particle systems that in simulations are able to form face-centred IQCs that are made up of interconnected icosahedra. The directional bonding of the particles facilitates the formation of a network of bonds with icosahedral orientational order and hence quasiperiodic positional order. The assembled quasicrystals have similar energies to periodic approximants but are entropically stabilized by phason disorder. Their long-range quasiperiodic order is confirmed by a higher-dimensional analysis. These materials, which are predicted to have an almost spherical photonic band gap, can potentially be realized via protein design and DNA origami particles.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured multiferroic liquids: on the way to fluid ferroelectric magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we demonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ligand vs. Linker on Phase Behavior and Mechanical Properties of Nanoparticle Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticle gels have attracted considerable attention due to their highly tunable properties. One strategy for producing nanoparticle gels involves using strong local attractions between polymeric molecules, such as DNA hybridization or dynamic covalent chemistry, to form percolated nanoparticle networks. These molecules can be used in two distinct roles: as "ligands" with one end grafted to a nanoparticle or as "linkers" with both ends free. Here, we explore how these roles shape the phase behavior and mechanical properties of gel-like nanoparticle assemblies using coarse-grained simulations. We systematically vary the interaction strength and bending stiffness of both ligands and linkers. We find that phase separation can be limited to low nanoparticle volume fractions by making the ligands rigid, consistent with previous studies on linked nanoparticle gels. At fixed interaction strength and volume fraction, both ligand- and linker-mediated nanoparticle assemblies show similar mechanical responses as bending stiffness is varied. However, a comparison between the two association schemes reveals that the linked nanoparticles form rigid percolated networks that are less stretchable than the ligand-grafted gels, despite exhibiting similar tensile strength. We attribute these differences between ligands and linkers to the distinct structural arrangement of nanoparticles within the gel. Our findings highlight the potential to use different association schemes to tune specific mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Combining integral equation closures with force density functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful framework to study inhomogeneous fluids. Its standard form is based on the knowledge of a generating free energy functional. If this is known exactly, then the results obtained by using standard DFT or its alternative, recently developed version, force-DFT, are the same. If the free energy functional is known only approximately then these two routes produce different outcomes. However, as we show in this work, force-DFT has the advantage that it is also implementable without knowledge of the free energy functional, by using instead liquid-state integral equation closures. This broadens the range of systems that can be explored, since free energy functionals are generally difficult to approximate. In this paper we investigate the utility of using inhomogeneous integral equation closures within force-DFT thus demonstrating the versatility and accuracy of this approach.</description>

Abstract: The kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials is developed. The scattering process is studied theoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter dependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct simulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>
