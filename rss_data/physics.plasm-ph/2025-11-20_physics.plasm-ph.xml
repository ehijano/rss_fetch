      <title>Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component ultrarelativistic plasma directly from kinetic theory. Starting with the Boltzmann--Vlasov equation and using the 14-moment approximation in the Landau frame, we obtain coupled evolution equations for the charge diffusion four-current and the shear-stress tensor. Benchmarking against the usual Israel-Stewart type relaxation form shows that this simplified description is accurate for small viscosity to entropy ($\eta/s$) ratio, vanishing magnetic field, and not so strong electric field. Outside this regime the dynamics depart in a controlled way, i.e., strong electric fields introduce nonlinear back-reaction that delays and reduces current peaks, and a sizable shear-stress is produced even without a flow profile.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Impact of edge turbulence spreading on broadening the heat flux width with plasma approaching the density limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of edge turbulence spreading on broadening the heat flux width in Ohmic-plasma approaching the density limit of the J-TEXT tokamak. At the plasma edge, the EXB shear flow collapses while turbulence transport and spreading enhances significantly when approaching the density limit. The heat flux width increases with normalized density. An energy production ratio model is used to quantify the contribution of edge turbulence spreading to the origin of the SOL turbulence. Experimental data show that the energy production ratio is much larger than 1, indicating that turbulence spreading at separatrix is the origin of the SOL turbulence. The heat flux widths increase with edge turbulence spreading as well as the energy production ratio. The impact of blob-induced transport on the heat flux width is investigated in detail. Especially, the average blob-induced spreading is about 81% of the total edge spreading in the high-density scenario. Blobs with larger radial scales enhance edge spreading into the SOL, thus dominating the SOL turbulence and consequently broadening the heat flux width. These results suggest that edge turbulence spreading plays a crucial role in broadening the heat flux width as plasma approaches the density limit.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of X- and O-points in Wendelstein 7-X with respect to coil currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyses vacuum magnetic field topology in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) with respect to changes in the current in the superconducting coils. We develop a fast automated scheme to locate fixed points (such as X- and O-points) and calculate the trace of the Jacobian of the field line map for them (Tr(M)), which represents several important properties of the fixed point. We perform two sets of coil current scans: (1) scans where each coil current is varied individually, using the "standard", "high iota" and "low iota" configurations as starting points; (2) a scan of over 200,000 magnetic configurations in which the coil currents are randomly sampled. In both cases we constrain the coil currents to the normal range of W7-X. We verify the principal roles of the non-planar, planar and control coils: the non-planar coils establish island chains with a certain phase; the planar coils modify the location of the island chain by both controlling the iota profile and shifting the configuration "inward" and "outward"; the control coil affects the island size and phase. We also find that |Tr(M)-2| (a quantity closely related to the magnitude of the Greene's residue) tends to increase with the minor radius of the fixed points, and that Tr(M) for X- and O-points can be very differently affected by the control coil current. Finally, we show that |Tr(M)-2| serves as a proxy for island size for internal island chains, which may help identification of suitable experimental candidates.</description>

      <title>Material processing by laser-plasma-filament-guided high voltage discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ablation experiments performed by laser-plasma-filament guided electrical discharges at high-voltages of up to 145 kV. The guiding was accomplished via fs-laser-generated plasma filaments across a gap of 201 mm of air onto steel 1.3343 samples. This method combines remote material processing and enables the steering and deflection of high voltage discharges with the ease-of-use of remote laser processing technology. We observe an increase of the per-pulse-(and-discharge)-ablated volume by a factor of 1.67 over an ablation regime when the discharges are not present and up to a factor of 12.5 over the case when neither discharges nor plasma filaments, only a loosely focused laser beam, are present.</description>

      <title>Proton specific entropy as a proxy for the $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ charge state ratio over heliocentric distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Drive beam depletion with multi-Joule energy transfer in a plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collider based on beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration will require the drive beam to transfer 10-100s of Joules to the plasma in each stage, with a drive-to-wake energy transfer efficiency exceeding 70%. Using an all-optical plasma source, we demonstrate significant progress towards these parameters, transferring at least 5.6 J from a 1.52 nC, 10 GeV electron beam to a $4.5\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ hydrogen plasma while achieving at least $37\pm 3\%$ drive-to-wake energy transfer efficiency. We observe deceleration of some particles to less than 0.93 GeV with up to 90% of the charge participating in the interaction.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath: space-time correlation using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfv\'enic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.</description>

      <title>Scaling of energy delivered through an electrostatic discharge to a small series load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy delivered through a small-resistance series ``victim'' load during electrostatic discharge events in air. For gap lengths over 1~mm, the fraction of the stored energy delivered is mostly gap-length independent, with a slight decrease at larger gaps due to electrode geometry. The energy to the victim scales linearly with circuit capacitance and victim load resistance but is not strongly dependent on circuit inductance. This scaling leads to a simple approach to predicting the maximum energy that will be delivered to a series resistance for the case where the victim load resistance is lower than the spark resistance.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>
