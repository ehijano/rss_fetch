      <title>Discontinuous stochastic forcing in Greenland ice core data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleoclimate proxy records from Greenland ice cores, archiving e.g. $\delta^{18}$O as a proxy for surface temperature, show that sudden climatic shifts called Dansgaard-Oeschger events (DO) occurred repeatedly during the last glacial interval. They comprised substantial warming of the Arctic region from cold to milder conditions. Concomitant abrupt changes in the dust concentrations of the same ice cores suggest that sudden reorganisations of the hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation have accompanied the warming events. Genuine bistability of the North Atlantic climate system is commonly hypothesised to explain the existence of stadial (cold) and interstadial (milder) periods in Greenland. However, the physical mechanisms that drove abrupt transitions from the stadial to the interstadial state, and more gradual yet still abrupt reverse transitions, remain debated. Here, we conduct a one-dimensional data-driven analysis of the Greenland temperature and atmospheric circulation proxies under the purview of stochastic processes. We take the Kramers-Moyal equation to estimate each proxy's drift and diffusion terms within a Markovian model framework. We then assess noise contributions beyond Gaussian white noise. The resulting stochastic differential equation (SDE) models feature a monostable drift for the Greenland temperature proxy and a bistable one for the atmospheric circulation proxy. Indicators of discontinuity in stochastic processes suggest to include higher-order terms of the Kramers-Moyal equation when modelling the Greenland temperature proxy's evolution. This constitutes a qualitative difference in the characteristics of the two time series, which should be further investigated from the standpoint of climate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Satellite Observations Guided Diffusion Model for Accurate Meteorological States at Arbitrary Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate acquisition of surface meteorological conditions at arbitrary locations holds significant importance for weather forecasting and climate simulation. Due to the fact that meteorological states derived from satellite observations are often provided in the form of low-resolution grid fields, the direct application of spatial interpolation to obtain meteorological states for specific locations often results in significant discrepancies when compared to actual observations. Existing downscaling methods for acquiring meteorological state information at higher resolutions commonly overlook the correlation with satellite observations. To bridge the gap, we propose Satellite-observations Guided Diffusion Model (SGD), a conditional diffusion model pre-trained on ERA5 reanalysis data with satellite observations (GridSat) as conditions, which is employed for sampling downscaled meteorological states through a zero-shot guided sampling strategy and patch-based methods. During the training process, we propose to fuse the information from GridSat satellite observations into ERA5 maps via the attention mechanism, enabling SGD to generate atmospheric states that align more accurately with actual conditions. In the sampling, we employed optimizable convolutional kernels to simulate the upscale process, thereby generating high-resolution ERA5 maps using low-resolution ERA5 maps as well as observations from weather stations as guidance. Moreover, our devised patch-based method promotes SGD to generate meteorological states at arbitrary resolutions. Experiments demonstrate SGD fulfills accurate meteorological states downscaling to 6.25km.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is a local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. The time of existence that we obtain is uniform with respect to the size $\epsilon$ of the perturbation, and boils down to the large time $1/\epsilon$ with the assumptions of the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020. With additional assumptions, it is also uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>
