      <title>High-Frequency Options Trading | With Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the effectiveness of high-frequency options trading strategies enhanced by advanced portfolio optimization techniques, investigating their ability to consistently generate positive returns compared to traditional long or short positions on options. Utilizing SPY options data recorded in five-minute intervals over a one-month period, we calculate key metrics such as Option Greeks and implied volatility, applying the Binomial Tree model for American options pricing and the Newton-Raphson algorithm for implied volatility calculation. Investment universes are constructed based on criteria like implied volatility and Greeks, followed by the application of various portfolio optimization models, including Standard Mean-Variance and Robust Methods. Our research finds that while basic long-short strategies centered on implied volatility and Greeks generally underperform, more sophisticated strategies incorporating advanced Greeks, such as Vega and Rho, along with dynamic portfolio optimization, show potential in effectively navigating the complexities of the options market. The study highlights the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in dynamic portfolio strategies within the high-frequency trading environment, particularly under volatile market conditions. Future research could refine strategy parameters and explore less frequently traded options, offering new insights into high-frequency options trading and portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach for Algorithmic Fairness Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the EU AI Act effective from 1 August 2024, high-risk applications like credit scoring must adhere to stringent transparency and quality standards, including algorithmic fairness evaluations. Consequently, developing tools for auditing algorithmic fairness has become crucial. This paper addresses a key question: how can we scientifically audit algorithmic fairness? It is vital to determine whether adverse decisions result from algorithmic discrimination or the subjects' inherent limitations. We introduce a novel auditing framework, ``peer-induced fairness'', leveraging counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques within credit approval systems. Our approach assesses fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons, independent of specific AI methodologies. It effectively tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, common in traditional models, particularly in credit approval. Model-agnostic and flexible, the framework functions as both a self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, offering ease of integration. It also meets the EU AI Act's transparency requirements by providing clear feedback on whether adverse decisions stem from personal capabilities or discrimination. We demonstrate the framework's usefulness by applying it to SME credit approval, revealing significant bias: 41.51% of micro-firms face discrimination compared to non-micro firms. These findings highlight the framework's potential for diverse AI applications.</description>
