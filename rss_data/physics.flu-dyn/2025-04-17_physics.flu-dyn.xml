      <title>Meniscus-Driven Modulation of Surface Wave Transmission Across Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meniscus oscillations at interfaces between liquids, solids, and air significantly impact fluid dynamics and control. While idealized models exist, experimental data on capillary-gravity wave scattering involving meniscus effects remain limited. In this study, we systematically measured wave transmission past a surface-piercing barrier, focusing on meniscus and contact-line effects. By varying the barrier's surface properties and the wave frequencies, we explored how meniscus deformation influences wave transmission. The results are compared with simulations and limiting-case theories. We find that the meniscus water column beneath the barrier enhances coupling and increases transmission, while surface bending suppresses it by constraining motion. These competing effects explain the observed frequency and contact angle dependencies. Our findings provide insights into how meniscus dynamics govern surface wave behavior.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Capillary-Gravity Waves by a Fixed, Semi-immersed Cylindrical Barrier with Contact Line Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of surface waves by structures intersecting liquid surfaces is fundamental in fluid mechanics, with prior studies exploring gravity, capillary, and capillary-gravity wave interactions. This paper develops a semi-analytical framework for capillary-gravity wave scattering by a fixed, horizontally placed, semi-immersed cylindrical barrier. Assuming linearized potential flow, the problem is formulated with differential equations, conformal mapping, and Fourier transforms, resulting in a compound integral equation framework solved numerically via the Nystr\"om method. An effective-slip dynamic contact line model accounting for viscous dissipation links contact line velocity to deviations from equilibrium contact angles, with fixed and free contact lines of no dissipation as limiting cases. The framework computes transmission and reflection coefficients as functions of the Bond number, slip coefficient, and barrier radius, validating energy conservation and confirming a $90^\circ$ phase difference between transmission and reflection in specific limits. A closed-form solution for scattering by an infinitesimal barrier, derived using Fourier transforms, reveals spatial symmetry in the diffracted field, reduced transmission transitioning from gravity to capillary waves, and peak contact line dissipation when the slip coefficient matches the capillary wave phase speed. This dissipation, linked to impedance matching at the contact lines, persists across a range of barrier sizes. These results advance theoretical insights into surface-tension-dominated fluid mechanics, offering a robust theoretical framework for analyzing wave scattering and comparison with future experimental and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Surface Wave Propagation over Meniscus and Scattering by a Surface-piercing Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that the meniscus formed near a surface-piercing barrier can significantly alter the propagation and scattering of capillary-gravity surface waves, beyond what classic flat-surface models predict. In particular, wave transmission increases as the barrier pulls up the meniscus, then drops sharply if the barrier is raised further, overturning the meniscus. Motivated by these findings, this paper develops two linearized theoretical frameworks that incorporate meniscus geometry and pinned contact line conditions into capillary-gravity wave propagation and scattering. Model~1 assumes a vertical wave perturbation of the unperturbed meniscus, thereby extending classic flat-surface boundary conditions in a relatively straightforward manner. Model~2 takes a more comprehensive approach, defining surface wave perturbations normal to the curved meniscus and reparameterizing boundary conditions in terms of arc length. While Model~1 proves convenient mathematically, it is restricted to single-valued meniscus shapes. By contrast, Model~2 is capable of describing multi-valued or overturning free surfaces, thereby capturing a wider range of physically realistic scenarios. Numerical simulations based on both models reproduce the experimental observations on how wave transmission varies with changes in meniscus height and contact angles as the barrier is lifted, underscoring the critical influence of meniscus curvature in small-scale wave-structure interactions. These results establish a robust theoretical foundation for predicting and optimizing capillary-gravity wave scattering in microfluidic, industrial, and scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetry in passive scalar advected by 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show that passive scalars possess a hidden scaling symmetry when considering suitably rescaled fields. Such a symmetry implies (i) universal probability distribution for scalar multipliers and (ii) Perron-Frobenius scenario for the anomalous scaling of structure functions. We verify these predictions with high resolution simulations of a passive scalar advected by a 2D turbulent flow in inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-promoting methods for isolating dominant linear amplification mechanisms in wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a method to identify and isolate the physical mechanisms that are responsible for linear energy amplification in fluid flows. This is achieved by applying a sparsity-promoting methodology to the resolvent form of the governing equations, solving an optimization problem that balances retaining the amplification properties of the original operator with minimizing the number of terms retained in the simplified sparse model. This results in simplified operators that often have very similar pseudospectral properties as the original equations. The method is demonstrated on both incompressible and compressible wall-bounded parallel shear flows, where the results obtained from the proposed method appear to be consistent with known mechanisms and simplifying assumptions, such as the lift-up mechanism, and (for the compressible case) Morkovin's hypothesis and the strong Reynolds analogy. This provides a framework for the application of this method to problems for which knowledge of pertinent amplification mechanisms is less established.</description>

      <title>Pulsatile Magnetized $Cu$-$Al_{2}O_{3}$/Casson Blood Flow Through an Elliptical Stenotic Artery for Drug Delivery Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis is a primary cause of stenosis, involving the accumulation of plaques in the inner lining of an artery. Inspired by drug delivery applications, the proposed study aims to examine the numerical modeling of a two-dimensional, axisymmetric, and time-dependent hybrid nanofluid composed of copper $(Cu)$, alumina $(Al_{2}O_{3})$ nanoparticles, and blood as base fluid. Blood, modeled by the non-Newtonian Casson model, flows through an elliptical stenotic artery. The pulsatile nature of the pressure gradient and magnetic field impact with the Hall current parameter are also taken into account in this study. A finite difference technique, forward in time and central in space (FTCS), is deployed to numerically discretize the transformed dimensionless model using MATLAB. Comprehensive visualization of the effects of hemodynamic, geometric, and nanoscale parameters on transport characteristics, and extensive graphical results for blood flow characteristics are provided. A comparison is made among blood, regular nanofluid, and hybrid nanofluid to analyze their properties in relation to fluid flow and heat transfer. An augmentation in the non-Newtonian parameter results in an amplification of velocity and in a reduction of the temperature profile. Incorporating $Cu$ and $Al_2O_3$ nanoparticles into the fluid results in a decrease of velocity and an increase of temperature. These findings possess significant practical implications for applications where efficient heat transfer is essential, such as in drug delivery systems and the thermal management of biomedical devices. However, the observed reduction in velocity may necessitate modifications to flow conditions to ensure optimal operational performance in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Control of Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection: Effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning in the Turbulent Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven flow control has significant potential for industry, energy systems, and climate science. In this work, we study the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reducing convective heat transfer in the 2D Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC) system under increasing turbulence. We investigate the generalizability of control across varying initial conditions and turbulence levels and introduce a reward shaping technique to accelerate the training. RL agents trained via single-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are compared to linear proportional derivative (PD) controllers from classical control theory. The RL agents reduced convection, measured by the Nusselt Number, by up to 33% in moderately turbulent systems and 10% in highly turbulent settings, clearly outperforming PD control in all settings. The agents showed strong generalization performance across different initial conditions and to a significant extent, generalized to higher degrees of turbulence. The reward shaping improved sample efficiency and consistently stabilized the Nusselt Number to higher turbulence levels.</description>

      <title>Computational Exploration of Inclined Magnetic Fields and Variable Thermal Flux Effects on the Flow of Dusty Hybrid Nanofluid around Stretching/Shrinking Wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This extensive investigation explores the influence of inclined magnetic fields and radiative non-linear heat flux on the behavior of dusty hybrid nanofluids over stretching/shrinking wedges. Employing $Cu$-$SiO_2$ as a hybrid nanoparticle composition and ethylene glycol $(EG)$ as the base liquid, the study investigates the fluid's response to a uniform magnetic field. The governing partial differential equations and associated boundary conditions are adeptly transformed into ordinary differential equations using appropriate transformations and then non-dimensionalized. Numerical simulations are executed using MATLAB and the bvp-4c solver. The outcomes offer a profound insight into thermofluid dynamics in industrial applications featuring intricate fluid flows, evaluating the influence of magnetic parameters on diverse fluid types, including nanofluids and dusty hybrid nanofluids. Furthermore, the investigation analyzes the impact of heat production and absorption on both vertical and horizontal plates, studying the significance of the velocity ratio factor in relation to the drag coefficient and local Nusselt number under thermal conditions of generation and absorption.</description>

      <title>On the range of validity of parabolic models for fluid flow through isotropic homogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-Boltzmann methods are established mesoscopic numerical schemes for fluid flow, that recover the evolution of macroscopic quantities (viz., velocity and pressure fields) evolving under macroscopic target equations. The approximated target equations for fluid flows are typically parabolic and include a (weak) compressibility term. A number of Lattice-Boltzmann models targeting, or making use of, flow through porous media in the representative elementary volume, have been successfully developed. However, apart from two exceptions, the target equations are not reported, or the assumptions for and approximations of these equations are not fully clarified. Within this work, the underlying assumption underpinning parabolic equations for porous flow in the representative elementary volume, are discussed, clarified and listed. It is shown that the commonly-adopted assumption of negligible hydraulic dispersion is not justifiable by clear argument - and in fact, that by not adopting it, one can provide a qualitative and quantitative expression for the effective viscosity in the Brinkman correction of Darcy law. Finally, it is shown that, under certain conditions, it is possible to interpret porous models as Euler-Euler multiphase models wherein one phase is the solid matrix.</description>

      <title>A method for bounding high-order finite element functions: Applications to mesh validity and bounds-preserving limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for bounding high-order multi-dimensional polynomials in finite element approximations. The method involves precomputing optimal piecewise-linear bounding boxes for polynomial basis functions, which can then be used to locally bound any combination of these basis functions. This approach can be applied to any element/basis type at any approximation order, can provide local (i.e., subcell) extremum bounds to a desired level of accuracy, and can be evaluated efficiently on-the-fly in simulations. Furthermore, we show that this approach generally yields more accurate bounds in comparison to traditional methods based on convex hull properties (e.g., Bernstein polynomials). The efficacy of this technique is shown in applications such as mesh validity checks and optimization for high-order curved meshes, where positivity of the element Jacobian determinant can be ensured throughout the entire element, and continuously bounds-preserving limiters for hyperbolic systems, which can enforce maximum principle bounds across the entire solution polynomial.</description>

      <title>No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schr\"{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Turbulence Modeling Approach for Cold-Wall Hypersonic Boundary Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wall-cooling effect in hypersonic boundary layers can significantly alter the near-wall turbulence behavior, which is not accurately modeled by traditional RANS turbulence models. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a turbulence modeling approach for hypersonic flows with cold-wall conditions using an iterative ensemble Kalman method. Specifically, a neural-network-based turbulence model is used to provide closure mapping from mean flow quantities to Reynolds stress as well as a variable turbulent Prandtl number. Sparse observation data of velocity and temperature are used to train the turbulence model. This approach is analyzed using direct numerical simulation database for zero-pressure gradient (ZPG) boundary layer flows over a flat plate with a Mach number between 6 and 14 and wall-to-recovery temperature ratios ranging from 0.18 to 0.76. Two training cases are conducted: 1) a single training case with observation data from one flow case, 2) a joint training case where data from two flow cases are simultaneously used for training. Trained models are also tested for generalizability on the remaining flow cases in each of the training cases. The results are also analyzed for insights to inform the future work towards enhancing the generalizability of the learned turbulence model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many problems of interest in engineering, medicine, and the fundamental sciences rely on high-fidelity flow simulation, making performant computational fluid dynamics solvers a mainstay of the open-source software community. A previous work (Bryngelson et al., Comp. Phys. Comm. (2021)) published MFC 3.0 with numerous physical features, numerics, and scalability. MFC 5.0 is a marked update to MFC 3.0, including a broad set of well-established and novel physical models and numerical methods, and the introduction of XPU acceleration. We exhibit state-of-the-art performance and ideal scaling on the first two exascale supercomputers, OLCF Frontier and LLNL El Capitan. Combined with MFC's single-accelerator performance, MFC achieves exascale computation in practice. New physical features include the immersed boundary method, N-fluid phase change, Euler--Euler and Euler--Lagrange sub-grid bubble models, fluid-structure interaction, hypo- and hyper-elastic materials, chemically reacting flow, two-material surface tension, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and more. Numerical techniques now represent the current state-of-the-art, including general relaxation characteristic boundary conditions, WENO variants, Strang splitting for stiff sub-grid flow features, and low Mach number treatments. Weak scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs on OLCF Summit and Frontier and LLNL El Capitan sees efficiencies within 5% of ideal to their full system sizes.

      <title>Mass diffusion and bending in dynamic wetting by phase-field and sharp interface models</title>

Abstract: Dynamic wetting poses a well-known challenge in classical sharp interface formulation as the no-slip wall condition leads to a contact line singularity that is typically regularized with a Navier boundary condition, often requiring empirical fitting for the slip length. On the other hand, this paradox does not appear in phase field models as the contact line moves through diffusive mass transport. In this work, we present a toy model that accounts for mass diffusion at the contact line within a sharp interface framework. This model is based on a theoretical relation derived from the Cahn-Hilliard equations, which links the total diffusive mass transport to the curvature at the wall. From an estimate of the chemical potential on a curved interface, we obtain an expression for the width of the highly curved region $\delta$ and the apparent angle. In the sharp interface model, we then introduce a fictitious boundary, displaced of a distance $\delta$ into the domain, where a Navier boundary condition is applied along a dynamic apparent contact angle that accounts for the local interface bending. The robustness of the model is assessed by comparing the toy model results with standard phase field ones on two cases: the steady state profiles of a liquid bridge between two plates moving in opposite directions and the transient behaviors of a drop spreading on a solid with a prescribed equilibrium angle. This offers a practical and efficient alternative to solve contact line problems at lower cost in a sharp interface framework with input parameters from phase field models.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of supersonic three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers</title>

Abstract: Supersonic turbulent channels subjected to sudden spanwise acceleration at initial friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 500 and different Mach numbers are studied through direct numerical simulations. The response to the spanwise acceleration creates a transient period where the flow exhibits three-dimensionality in the mean statistics. This enables a detailed study of the thermal transport and development of velocity transformations and Reynolds analogies for compressible turbulent flows in swept-like conditions. Extensions of velocity transformations to three-dimensional flows demonstrate near-wall self-similarity of the velocity, providing evidence for Morkovin's hypothesis in nonequilibrium conditions. A similarity solution for the spanwise velocity, valid during the initial transient, is also presented. During the transient, both the thermal fluctuations and turbulent kinetic energy decrease, consistent with previous observations in incompressible flows (Lozano-Duran, \textit{et al.} 2019, Moin, \textit{et al.} 1990). For sufficiently strong spanwise acceleration, $Q_{3}$ $(+T',+v')$ and $Q_{1}$ $(-T',-v')$ events become more significant than sweep and ejections across the channel, creating changes in sign in the velocity-temperature covariances. The temporal evolution of the orientation and sizes of the turbulent kinetic energy and temperature carrying structures is quantified through structure identification and spectra. Finally, the generalized Reynolds analogy (Zhang, \textit{et al.} 2012) is derived for a transient three-dimensional flow, allowing predictions of the mean temperature from the velocity.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable -- potential vorticity (PV) -- is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are ``balanced''. For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulations of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ show that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts.</description>
