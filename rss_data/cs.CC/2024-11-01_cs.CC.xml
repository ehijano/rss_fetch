      <title>Learning quantum states prepared by shallow circuits in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a polynomial time algorithm that, given copies of an unknown quantum state $\vert\psi\rangle=U\vert 0^n\rangle$ that is prepared by an unknown constant depth circuit $U$ on a finite-dimensional lattice, learns a constant depth quantum circuit that prepares $\vert\psi\rangle$. The algorithm extends to the case when the depth of $U$ is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$, with a quasi-polynomial run-time. The key new idea is a simple and general procedure that efficiently reconstructs the global state $\vert\psi\rangle$ from its local reduced density matrices. As an application, we give an efficient algorithm to test whether an unknown quantum state on a lattice has low or high quantum circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>UniqueQMA vs QMA: oracle separation and eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-standing open question of the power of unique witness in quantum protocols, which asks if UniqueQMA, a variant of QMA whose accepting witness space is 1-dimensional, is equal to QMA. We show a quantum oracle separation between UniqueQMA and QMA via an extension of the Aaronson-Kuperberg's QCMA vs QMA oracle separation. In particular, we show that any UniqueQMA protocol must make $\Omega(\sqrt{D})$ queries to a subspace phase oracle of unknown dimension $\leq D$ to "find" the subspace. This presents an obstacle to relativizing techniques in resolving this question (unlike its classical analogue - the Valiant-Vazirani theorem - which is essentially a black-box reduction) and suggests the need to study the structure of the ground space of local Hamiltonians in distilling a potential unique witness. Our techniques also yield a quantum oracle separation between QXC, the class characterizing quantum approximate counting, and QMA.
  Very few structural properties are known that place the complexity of local Hamiltonians in UniqueQMA. We expand this set of properties by showing that the ground energy of local Hamiltonians that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) can be estimated through a UniqueQMA protocol. Specifically, our protocol can be viewed as a quantum expander test in a low energy subspace of the Hamiltonian and verifies a unique entangled state in two copies of the subspace. This allows us to conclude that if UniqueQMA $\neq$ QMA, then QMA-hard Hamiltonians must violate ETH under adversarial perturbations (more accurately, under the quantum PCP conjecture if ETH only applies to extensive energy subspaces). Our results serve as evidence that chaotic local Hamiltonians, such as the SYK model, contain polynomial verifiable quantum states in their low energy regime and may be simpler than general local Hamiltonians if UniqueQMA $\neq$ QMA.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for a Modification of the Shortest Common Superstring Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to develop an efficient algorithm to solve a variation of the NP-hard Shortest Common Superstring (SCS) problem. In this version of the problem, one string is allowed to have up to K mistakes, meaning it does not match the SCS in at most K places. Also, there is a slight constraint on the problem in that no string can be a substring of another. The algorithm proposed is exact, not an approximation, meaning it finds the best answer in all cases.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference and Computation of Optimal Alternatives for Preference Languages Based On Lexicographic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse preference inference, through consistency, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. We identify a property, which we call strong compositionality, that applies for many natural kinds of preference statement, and that allows a greedy algorithm for determining consistency of a set of preference statements. We also consider different natural definitions of optimality, and their relations to each other, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. Based on our framework, we show that testing consistency, and thus inference, is polynomial for a specific preference language LpqT, which allows strict and non-strict statements, comparisons between outcomes and between partial tuples, both ceteris paribus and strong statements, and their combination. Computing different kinds of optimal sets is also shown to be polynomial; this is backed up by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two models of space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems, ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. The ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ model, a space-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\sf QIP}$) introduced by Watrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier actions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically many intermediate measurements per verifier action (with a high-concentration condition on yes instances), making it the weakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS 1995).
  We characterize the computational power of ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L} \subsetneq {\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\sf P} = {\sf NP}$:
  - ${\sf QIPL}$ exactly characterizes ${\sf NP}$.
  - ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\sf P}$ and contains ${\sf SAC}^1 \cup {\sf BQL}$, where ${\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical logarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits.
  However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant. Our results further indicate that intermediate measurements uniquely impact space-bounded quantum interactive proofs, unlike in space-bounded quantum computation, where ${\sf BQL}={\sf BQ_{\rm U}L}$.
  We also introduce space-bounded unitary quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L}$), a specific form of ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ proof systems with statistical zero-knowledge against any verifier. This class is a space-bounded variant of quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK}$) defined by Watrous (SICOMP 2009). We prove that ${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L} = {\sf BQL}$, implying that the statistical zero-knowledge property negates the computational advantage typically gained from the interaction.</description>

      <title>Interactive proofs for verifying (quantum) learning and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</description>

      <title>Persuading a Credible Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to optimally persuade an agent who has a private type? When elicitation is feasible, this amounts to a fairly standard principal-agent-style mechanism design problem, where the persuader employs a mechanism to first elicit the agent's type and then plays the corresponding persuasion strategy based on the agent's report. The optimal mechanism design problem in this setting is relatively well-understood in the literature, with incentive compatible (IC) mechanisms known to be optimal and computationally tractable. In this paper, we study this problem given a credible agent, i.e., if the agent claims they are of a certain type in response to the mechanism's elicitation, then they will act optimally with respect to the claimed type, even if they are actually not of that type.
  We present several interesting findings in this new setting that differ significantly from results in the non-credible setting. In terms of the structure of optimal mechanisms, we show that not only may IC mechanisms fail to be optimal, but all mechanisms following the standard `eliciting-then-persuading' mechanism design structure may be suboptimal. To achieve optimality requires two additional instruments -- pre-signaling and non-binding elicitation -- which naturally result in multi-stage mechanisms. We characterize optimal mechanisms under these design choices. Based on our characterization, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal multi-stage mechanisms. We also discover that in scenarios that allow for it, partial information elicitation can be employed to improve the principal's payoff even further. Though, surprisingly, an unbounded number of rounds of information exchange between the principal and the agent may be necessary to achieve optimality.</description>

      <title>The periodic structure of local consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We connect the mixing behaviour of random walks over a graph to the power of the local-consistency algorithm for the solution of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We extend this connection to arbitrary CSPs and their promise variant. In this way, we establish a linear-level (and, thus, optimal) lower bound against the local-consistency algorithm applied to the class of aperiodic promise CSPs. The proof is based on a combination of the probabilistic method for random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraphs and a structural result on the number of fibers (i.e., long chains of hyperedges) in sparse hypergraphs of large girth. As a corollary, we completely classify the power of local consistency for the approximate graph homomorphism problem by establishing that, in the nontrivial cases, the problem has linear width.</description>

      <title>Multi-Structural Games and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-structural (MS) games are combinatorial games that capture the number of quantifiers of first-order sentences. On the face of their definition, MS games differ from Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse (EF) games in two ways: first, MS games are played on two sets of structures, while EF games are played on a pair of structures; second, in MS games, Duplicator can make any number of copies of structures. In the first part of this paper, we perform a finer analysis of MS games and develop a closer comparison of MS games with EF games. In particular, we point out that the use of sets of structures is of the essence and that when MS games are played on pairs of structures, they capture Boolean combinations of first-order sentences with a fixed number of quantifiers. After this, we focus on another important difference between MS games and EF games, namely, the necessity for Spoiler to play on top of a previous move in order to win some MS games. Via an analysis of the types realized during MS games, we delineate the expressive power of the variant of MS games in which Spoiler never plays on top of a previous move. In the second part we focus on simultaneously capturing number of quantifiers and number of variables in first-order logic. We show that natural variants of the MS game do *not* achieve this. We then introduce a new game, the quantifier-variable tree game, and show that it simultaneously captures the number of quantifiers and number of variables. We conclude by generalizing this game to a family of games, the *syntactic games*, that simultaneously capture reasonable syntactic measures and the number of variables.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as the distribution of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers rely on seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify the impact of their interventions. In such cases, building a complete sexual activity network is often infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, that is, sequences of sexual contacts without requiring complete network information. This presents two challenges: protecting individual privacy in contact data and adapting seeding algorithms to work effectively with incomplete network information. To solve these two problems, we study privacy guarantees for influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown and the inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random and need privacy protection. Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the collected data or the algorithm output and can bound the privacy loss of each node (or group of nodes) in deciding to include their data in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of seeding performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic random graphs and empirically grounded sexual contacts of men who have sex with men reveal the diminishing value of network information with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes and graceful decrease in performance with decreasing privacy budget in the central regime. Achieving good performance with local privacy guarantees requires relatively higher privacy budgets that confirm our theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Basic Feasible Functionals Through Higher-Order Rewriting and Tuple Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class of type-two basic feasible functionals ($\mathtt{BFF}_2$) is the analogue of $\mathtt{FP}$ (polynomial time functions) for type-2 functionals, that is, functionals that can take (first-order) functions as arguments. $\mathtt{BFF}_2$ can be defined through Oracle Turing machines with running time bounded by second-order polynomials. On the other hand, higher-order term rewriting provides an elegant formalism for expressing higher-order computation. We address the problem of characterizing $\mathtt{BFF}_2$ by higher-order term rewriting. Various kinds of interpretations for first-order term rewriting have been introduced in the literature for proving termination and characterizing first-order complexity classes. In this paper, we consider a recently introduced notion of cost-size interpretations for higher-order term rewriting and see second order rewriting as ways of computing type-2 functionals. We then prove that the class of functionals represented by higher-order terms admitting polynomially bounded cost-size interpretations exactly corresponds to $\mathtt{BFF}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness is a desirable and crucial property of many protocols that handle, for instance, exchanges of message.
  It states that if at least one agent engaging in the protocol is honest, then either the protocol will unfold correctly and fulfill its intended goal for all participants, or it will fail for everyone.
  In this work, we present a game-based framework for the study of fairness protocols, that does not define a priori an attacker model.
  It is based on the notion of strong secure equilibria, and leverages the conceptual and algorithmic toolbox of game theory.
  In the case of finite games, we provide decision procedures with tight complexity bounds for determining whether a protocol is immune to nefarious attacks from a coalition of participants, and whether such a protocol could exist based on the underlying graph structure and objectives.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give answer to an argument trying to show the divergence of Assembly Theory from LZ compression. We formally proved that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) is equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP/PNG via LZ compression. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defence against the proof that the assembly index calculation method is an LZ scheme, is based on an incomplete and misleading experiment. When the experiment is completed and conducted properly, the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident and aligned with the proof previously offered. Therefore, this completes both the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of object repetitions `to arrive at a measure for life', is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse' defence argument against compression does not withstand basic scrutiny, and that their empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, nota special feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a special case of our BDM introduced almost a decade earlier and that arguments attributing special stochastic properties to Ai are misleading, not unique, and exactly the same than those that Shannon Entropy is already not only equipped with but designed for which we have also proven to be equivalent to Ai making AT redundant even in practice when applied to their own experimental data.</description>
