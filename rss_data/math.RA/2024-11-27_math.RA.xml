      <title>TTF classes generated by silting modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conditions under which a TTF class in a module category over a ring is silting. Using the correspondence between idempotent ideals over a ring and TTF classes in the module category, we focus on finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for $R/I$ to be a silting $R$-module, and hence for the TTF class $\mathbf{Gen}(R/I)$ to be silting, where $I$ is an idempotent two-sided ideal of $R$. In our main result, we show that $R/I$ is a silting module whenever $I$ is the trace of a projective $R$-module. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the converse holds for a broad class of rings, including semiperfect rings.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <title>Global Weyl modules for thin Lie algebras are finite-dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Weyl modules, both local and global, goes back to Chari and Pressley in the case of affine Lie algebras, and has been extensively studied for various Lie algebras graded by root systems. We extend that definition to a certain class of Lie algebras graded by weight lattices and prove that if such a Lie algebra satisfies a natural "thinness" condition, then already the global Weyl modules are finite-dimensional. Our motivating example of a thin Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane vanishing at the origin. We also introduce stratifications of categories of modules over such Lie algebras and identify the corresponding strata categories.</description>

      <title>Verbal ideals and unobstructed complex parallelisable nilmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a compact complex parallelisable nilmanifold has unobstructed deformations if and only if its associated Lie algebra satisfies a reality condition and is a free Lie algebra in a variety of Lie algebras, that is, defined by a verbal ideal in a free Lie algebra. We provide a partial classification of verbal ideals and show that there are finitely many such Lie algebras up to dimension 19, whereas infinite families start to appear in dimension 20. As a consequence, there are finitely many complex homotopy types of unobstructed complex parallelisable nilmanifolds up to dimension 19, and infinitely many in dimension 20.</description>

      <title>Classifying the Polish semigroup topologies on the symmetric inverse monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all Polish semigroup topologies on the symmetric inverse monoid on the natural numbers. This result answers a question of Elliott et al. There are countably infinitely many such topologies. Under containment, these Polish semigroup topologies form a join-semilattice with infinite descending chains, no infinite ascending chains, and arbitrarily large finite anti-chains. Also, we show that the monoid endowed with any second countable T_1 semigroup topology is homeomorphic to the Baire space.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative resolutions of AS-Gorenstein isolated singularites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate noncommutative resolutions of (generalized) AS-Gorenstein isolated singularities. Noncommutative resolutions in graded case are achieved as the graded endomorphism rings of some finitely generated graded modules, which are seldom $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebras but bounded-below $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebras. So, the paper works on locally finite bounded-below $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebras. We first define and study noncommutative projective schemes after Artin-Zhang, and define noncommutative quasi-projective spaces as the base spaces of noncommutative projective schemes. The equivalences between noncommutative quasi-projective spaces are proved to be induced by so-called modulo-torsion-invertible bimodules, which is in fact a Morita-like theory at the quotient category level. Based on the equivalences, we propose a definition of noncommutative resolutions of generalized AS-Gorenstein isolated singularities, and prove that such noncommutative resolutions are generalized AS regular algebras. The center of any noncommutative resolution is isomorphic to the center of the original generalized AS-Gorenstein isolated singularity. In the final part we prove that a noncommutative resolution of an AS-Gorenstein isolated singularity of dimension $d$ is given by an MCM generator $M$ if and only if $M$ is a $(d-1)$-cluster tilting module. A noncommutative version of the Bondal-Orlov conjecture is also proved to be true in dimension 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Root of unity quantum cluster algebras and discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a connection between the subjects of cluster algebras, polynomial identity algebras and discriminants. For this, we define the notion of root of unity quantum cluster algebras and prove that they are polynomial identity algebras. Inside each such algebra we construct a (large) canonical central subalgebra, which can be viewed as a far reaching generalization of the central subalgebras of big quantum groups constructed by De Concini, Kac and Procesi and used in representation theory. Each such central subalgebra is proved to be isomorphic to the underlying classical cluster algebra of geometric type. When the root of unity quantum cluster algebra is free over its central subalgebra, we prove that the discriminant of the pair is a product of powers of the frozen variables times an integer. An extension of this result is also proved for the discriminants of all subalgebras generated by the cluster variables of nerves in the exchange graph. These results can be used for the effective computation of discriminants. As an application we prove an explicit formula for the discriminant of the integral form over ${\mathbb{Z}}[\varepsilon]$ of each quantum unipotent cells of De Concini, Kac and Procesi for arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, where $\varepsilon$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Semiprime ideals in C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a not necessarily closed ideal in a C*-algebra is semiprime if and only if it is idempotent, if and only if it is closed under square roots of positive elements. Among other things, it follows that prime and semiprime ideals in C*-algebras are automatically self-adjoint.
  To prove the above, we isolate and study a particular class of ideals, which we call Dixmier ideals. As it turns out, there is a rich theory of powers and roots for Dixmier ideals. We show that every ideal in a C*-algebra is squeezed by Dixmier ideals from inside and outside tightly in a suitable sense, from which we are able to deduce information about the ideal in the middle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $k$-vector space, where $k$ is an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero. Let $G \subseteq \mathrm{SL}(V)$ be a finite abelian group, and denote by $S$ the $G$-invariant subring of the polynomial ring $k[V]$. It is shown that the singularity category $D_{sg}(S)$ recovers the reduced singular locus of $\mathrm{Spec}(S)$.</description>
