      <title>Temperature Dependence of Beam on Plasma Stopping Power in the Resonance Regions of Fusion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent proposal of accelerator based fusion reactor considers a scheme where an ion beam from the accelerator hits the target plasma on the resonance of the fusion reaction so that the reactivity ($\sigma v$) can be an order of magnitude larger than that of a thermonuclear reactor. One of the important inputs is the stopping power which is needed to assess the energy loss of the beam in the plasma. In this work, we shall use the analytic formulation of Brown, Preston and Singleton~\cite{Brown:2005ji} to calculate the temperature dependence of the stopping power due to the target $t, {}^3H_e$, and ${}^{11}B$ plasmas in the resonance regions of their respective fusion reactions, i.e., $ d + t \rightarrow n + \alpha, d + {}^3H_e \rightarrow p + \alpha$, and $p + {}^{11}B \rightarrow 3 \alpha$. It is found that the calculated stopping power, especially when the quantum corrections are included, does not go down with temperature as fast at $T^{-3/2}$. Instead it decreases slower, more like $T^{-x}$ with $x \le 1$ in the range of T from $\sim$ 5 to 50 keV for $d$ on $t$ and ${}^3H_e$ plasmas around their resonance energies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dynamo drive for the sawtooth relaxation process due to non-uniform resistivity distribution in a reversed field pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the three-dimensional resistive MHD code NIMROD to investigate the impact of resistivity inhomogeneity on the sawtooth process of an reversed field pinch (RFP) plasma. The simulation employs a non-uniform resistivity profile similar to experiments, which monotonically increases from the core to the edge as the temperature decreases. The resistivity inhomogeneity introduces an additional electric field in the plasma, which accelerates the inward diffusion of magnetic flux and changing the self sustained reversal state, hence significantly enhances the dynamo effect and the sawtooth process in the RFP plasma.</description>

      <title>Understanding observational characteristics of solar flare current sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elongated bright structures above solar flare loops are suggested to be current sheets, where magnetic reconnection takes place. Observations have revealed various characteristics of the current sheet; however, their physical origin remains to be ascertained. In this study we aim to reveal the relations of observational characteristics of current sheets with the fundamental processes of magnetic reconnection. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection within a solar flare current sheet, we synthesized the remote-sensing observations of the current sheet and determined their physical properties. Turbulent magnetic reconnection can significantly broaden the apparent width of the current sheet, which is much larger than the realistic physical width because of the superposition effect. The differential emission measures of the current sheet have two peaks; the high-temperature component is spatially related to confirmed small-scale reconnection sites, showing that the current sheet is directly heated by reconnection. Moreover, we demonstrate that strong turbulence can cause the nonthermal broadening of spectral lines at both the current sheet and flare loop-top regions. A strong correlation between them in time is also observed. Our 3D turbulent magnetic reconnection flare model can be used to interpret primary observational characteristics of the elongated bright current sheets of solar flares.</description>

      <title>How does Radiation Reaction Affect Relativistic Magnetized Shocks Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetized shocks, through the Synchrotron Maser Instability (SMI) mechanism, represent a promising framework for generating coherent radiations, potentially accounting for the enigmatic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)-cosmic radio transients with extreme luminosity. This study investigates how the radiation reaction (RR) effect, induced by high-energy photon emissions during SMI, significantly modifies particle dynamics and emission properties in magnetized shocks. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that RR effects fundamentally alter coherent cyclotron motion at shock fronts, producing distinct observational signatures: spectral broadening, peak frequency upshift, and enhanced radiation intensity. Our findings suggest that RR-mediated magnetized shocks could provide a natural explanation for the bimodal energy distribution observed in repeating FRB 121102 and the positive correlation of luminosity-bandwidth between repeating and one-off FRBs in CHIME/FRB catalog. These results support the magnetized shock as a viable source of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging turbulence data from fusion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various methods for leveraging turbulent fluctuation measurements from fusion plasma experiments are introduced, along with selected application examples. These can be categorized into spectral methods, statistical methods, and physics informed neural network based methods, and they are most effective for two-dimensional turbulence measurements, which are now widely accessible. Extracting more information from turbulence data would pave the way for a better understanding of plasma turbulence transport in fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Transport theory in moderately anisotropic plasmas: I, Collisionless aspects of axisymmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) together with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the general King mixture model (GKMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic non-equilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches $\sim200$~EeV known as Amaterasu CR. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of $\sim1$~ZeV ion within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of $\sim$~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim10$~PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the inner heliosphere, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>
