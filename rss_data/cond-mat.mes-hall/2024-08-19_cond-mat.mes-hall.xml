      <title>Multiplet Supercurrents in a Josephson Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to host synthetic topological phases of matter and Floquet states. However, the energy scales governing topological protection in these devices are on the order of the spacing between Andreev bound states. Recent theories suggest that similar phenomena may instead be explored in circuits composed of two-terminal Josephson junctions, allowing for the topological protection to be controlled by the comparatively large Josephson energy. Here, we explore a Josephson circuit, in which three superconducting electrodes are connected through Josephson junctions to a common superconducting island. We demonstrate the dynamic generation of multiplet resonances, which have previously been observed in multiterminal Josephson junctions. The multiplets are found to be robust to elevated temperatures and are confirmed by exhibiting the expected Shapiro step quantization under a microwave drive. We also find an unexpected novel supercurrent, which couples a pair of contacts that are both voltage-biased with respect to the common superconducting island. We show that this supercurrent results from synchronization of the phase dynamics and pose the question whether it should also carry a topological contribution.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Nano-Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect is a celebrated phenomenon in spintronics and magnetism that has found numerous applications in digital electronics (memory and logic), but very few in analog electronics. Practically, the only analog application in widespread use is the spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) that delivers a high frequency alternating current or voltage to a load. Here, we report its analogue - a spin Hall nano-antenna (SHNA) that radiates a high frequency electromagnetic wave (alternating electric/magnetic fields) into the surrounding medium. It can also radiate an acoustic wave in an underlying substrate if the nanomagnets are made of a magnetostrictive material. That makes it a dual electromagnetic/acoustic antenna. The SHNA is made of an array of ledged magnetostrictive nanomagnets deposited on a substrate, with a heavy metal nanostrip underlying/overlying the ledges. An alternating charge current passed through the nanostrip generates an alternating spin-orbit torque in the nanomagnets via the spin Hall effect which makes their magnetizations oscillate in time with the frequency of the current, producing confined spin waves (magnons), which radiate electromagnetic waves (photons) in space with the same frequency as the ac current. Despite being much smaller than the radiated wavelength, the SHNA surprisingly does not act as a point source which would radiate isotropically. Instead, there is clear directionality (anisotropy) in the radiation pattern, which is frequency-dependent. This is due to the (frequency-dependent) intrinsic anisotropy in the confined spin wave patterns generated within the nanomagnets, which effectively endows the "point source" with internal anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Spin Relaxation and Diffusion in Monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$ from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding spin relaxation in topological systems such as quantum spin-hall (QSH) insulator is critical for realizing coherent transport at high temperature. WTe$_{2}$, known as a QSH insulator with a high transition temperature of 100K, is an important test-bed of unveiling spin relaxation mechanism in topological materials. In this work, we employ our recently-developed \emph{ab initio} density-matrix dynamics approach to investigate spin relaxation mechanism, and calculate spin lifetime and diffusion length of monolayer 1T'-WTe$_{2}$, at finite temperature under an external electric field. We found the spin lifetime of electrons have the largest anisotropy when measuring along the canted-spin-texture direction. Moreover, we found an opposite trend between spin and carrier relaxation against applied electric field. Most importantly, the relaxation mechanism under intermediate electric field around 1V/nm can not be explained by either Eillot-Yafet or Dyakonov-Perel models, which highlights the generality of our \emph{ab initio} density-matrix framework. We then proposed analytical models to explain its mechanism and compare well with \emph{ab initio} results at small and large electric field. We predict that spin lifetime and spin diffusion length of bulk-state electrons are $\sim$1 ps and $\sim$30 nm at room temperature respectively, suggesting its promise for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Microwave Andreev bound state spectroscopy in a semiconductor-based Planar Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By coupling a semiconductor-based planar Josephson junction to a superconducting resonator, we investigate the Andreev bound states in the junction using dispersive readout techniques. Using electrostatic gating to create a narrow constriction in the junction, our measurements unveil a strong coupling interaction between the resonator and the Andreev bound states. This enables the mapping of isolated tunable Andreev bound states, with an observed transparency of up to 99.94\% along with an average induced superconducting gap of $\sim 150 \mu$eV. Exploring the gate parameter space further elucidates a non-monotonic evolution of multiple Andreev bound states with varying gate voltage. Complimentary tight-binding calculations of an Al-InAs planar Josephson junction with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling provide insight into possible mechanisms responsible for such behavior. Our findings highlight the subtleties of the Andreev spectrum of Josephson junctions fabricated on superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and offering potential applications in probing topological states in these hybrid platforms.</description>

      <title>Local and energy-resolved topological invariants for Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Observation of strong phonon-phonon coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena of pronounced electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in one-dimensional (1D) systems are ubiquitous, which are well described by frameworks of Luttinger liquid, Peierls instability and concomitant charge density wave. However, the experimental observation of strong phonon-phonon coupling in 1D was not demonstrated. Herein we report the first observation of strong phonon-phonon coupling in 1D condensed matters by using double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), representative 1D van der Waals crystals, with combining the spectroscopic and microscopic tools as well as the ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observe uncharted phonon modes in one commensurate and three incommensurate DWNT crystals, three of which concurrently exhibit strongly-reconstructed electronic band structures. Our DFT calculations for the experimentally observed commensurate DWNT (7,7) @ (12,12) reveal that this new phonon mode originates from a (nearly) degenerate coupling between two transverse acoustic eigenmodes (ZA modes) of constituent inner and outer nanotubes having trigonal and pentagonal rotational symmetry along the nanotube circumferences. Such coupling strongly hybridizes the two phonon modes in different shells and leads to the formation of a unique lattice motion featuring evenly distributed vibrational amplitudes over inner and outer nanotubes, distinct from any known phonon modes in 1D systems. All four DWNTs that exhibit the pronounced new phonon modes show small chiral angle twists, closely matched diameter ratios of 3/5 and decreased frequencies of new phonon modes with increasing diameters, all supporting the uncovered coupling mechanism. Our discovery of strong phonon-phonon coupling in DWNTs open new opportunities for engineering phonons and exploring novel phonon-related phenomena in 1D condensed matters.</description>

      <title>Initialization-Free Multistate Memristor: Synergy of Spin-Orbit Torque and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT)-based perpendicularly magnetized memory devices with multistate memory have garnered significant interest due to their applicability in low-power in-memory analog computing. However, current methods are hindered by initialization problems such as prolonged writing duration, and limitations on the number of magnetic states. Consequently, a universal method for achieving multistate in PMA-based stacks remains elusive. Here, we propose a general experimental method for achieving multistate without any initialization step in SOT-driven magnetization switching by integrating an external out-of-plane magnetic field. Motivated by macrospin calculations coupled with micromagnetic simulations, which demonstrate the plausibility of magnetization state changes due to out-of-plane field integration, we experimentally verify multistate behavior in Pt/Co/Pt and W/Pt/Co/AlOx stacks. The occurrence of multistate behavior is attributed to intermediate domain states with N\'eel domain walls. We achieve repeatable 18 multistate configurations with a minimal reduction in retentivity through energy barrier measurements, paving the way for efficient analog computing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrical transport unveils Fermi surface malleability in a moir\'e heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities enhance many-body interactions and induce collective states of matter ranging from superconductivity to magnetism. In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, van Hove singularities appear at low energies and are malleable with density, leading to a sequence of Lifshitz transitions and resets observable in Hall measurements. However, without a magnetic field, linear transport measurements have limited sensitivity to the band's topology. Here, we utilize nonlinear longitudinal and transverse transport measurements to probe these unique features in twisted bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. We demonstrate that the nonlinear responses, induced by the Berry curvature dipole and extrinsic scattering processes, intricately map the Fermi surface reconstructions at various fillings. Importantly, our experiments highlight the intrinsic connection of these features with the moir\'e bands. Beyond corroborating the insights from linear Hall measurements, our findings establish nonlinear transport as a pivotal tool for probing band topology and correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>A soft-clamped topological waveguide for phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed matter systems. Recently this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons and phonons, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits. Importantly, even in principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB/cm-level for phonon waveguides, be they topological or not. Here, we combine advanced dissipation engineering, in particular the recently introduced method of soft-clamping, with the concept of a valley-Hall topological insulator for phonons. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses of 3 dB/km at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. For the first time, the low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in a topological phonon waveguide, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120 degree-bend with a 99.99%-probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. The extraordinary combination of features of this novel platform suggest applications in classical and quantum signal routing, processing, and storage.</description>

      <title>About the significance of the driving current direction in ferromagnetic resonance experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of the effects of driving current direction on ferromagnetic resonance in NiFe foils. The rf driving current was applied to NiFe foils of different shapes. In rectangular samples with a close-to-uniform flow of the applied current along the long edge of the sample we find the resonance field to follow a simple 'cos' dependence on the angle between the current and external dc magnetic field. We argue that this behavior cannot be explained by the in-plane demagnetizing field of the rectangular foil. In triangular samples where the current partially flows along all three sample edges we observed three independent 'cos' features. The latter suggests individual contributions from different areas with different current directions. We were able to switch off one of these contributions by covering one edge of the triangular sample with a conducting overlayer and thereby effectively short-circuiting the corresponding current path. Our findings highlight the significance of driving current distributions in ferromagnetic resonance experiments.</description>

      <title>Electron beam splitting effect with crossed zigzag graphene nanoribbons in high-spin metallic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we analyze the electron transport properties of a device formed of two crossed graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges (ZGNRs) in a spin state with total magnetization different from zero. While the ground state of ZGNRs has been shown to display antiferromagnetic ordering between the electrons at the edges, for wide ZGNRs--where the localized spin states at the edges are decoupled and the exchange interaction is close to zero--, in presence of relatively small magnetic fields, the ferromagnetic (FM) spin configuration can in fact become the state of lowest energy due to the Zeeman effect. In these terms, by comparing the total energy of a periodic ZGNR as a function of the magnetization per unit cell we obtain the FM-like solution of lowest energy for the perfect ribbon, the corresponding FM-like configuration of lowest energy for the four-terminal device formed of crossed ZGNRs, and the critical magnetic field needed to excite the system to this spin configuration. By performing transport calculations, we analyze the role of the distance between layers and the crossing angle of this device in the electrical conductance, at small gate voltages. The problem is approached employing the mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian in combination with non-equilibrium Green's functions. We find that ZGNR devices subject to transverse magnetic fields may acquire a high-spin configuration that ensures a metallic response and tunable beam splitting properties, making this setting promising for studying electron quantum optics with single-electron excitations.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Chains via Combined On-surface Synthesis and Reduction for Spinon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains are excellent one-dimensional platforms for exploring quantum magnetic states and quasiparticle fractionalization. Understanding its quantum magnetism and quasiparticle excitation at the atomic scale is crucial for manipulating the quantum spin systems. Here, we report the fabrication of spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through on-surface synthesis and in-situ reduction. A closed-shell nanographene is employed as a precursor for Ullman coupling to avoid radical fusing, thus obtaining oligomer chains. Following exposure to atomic hydrogen and tip manipulation, closed-shell polymers are transformed into spin-1/2 chains with controlled lengths by reducing the ketone groups and subsequent hydrogen desorption. The spin excitation gaps are found to decrease in power-law as the chain lengths, suggesting its gapless feature. More interestingly, the spinon dispersion is extracted from the inelastic spectroscopic spectra, agreeing well with the calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of fabricating desired quantum systems through a combined on-surface synthesis and reduction approach.</description>

      <title>Exceptional magic angles in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) hosts a plethora of strongly correlated and topological phases due to its flat bands emerging in the moire superlattice close to the magic angle. However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising from the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored. Here we investigate a possibly simplest non-Hermitian version of twisted bilayer graphene (NH TBG) obtained by relative twisting of two NH graphene monolayers with the non-Hermiticity encoded in imbalance in the in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions. In particular, within the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach generalized to the NH systems, we obtain the corresponding continuum Dirac-like Hamiltonian for the NH TBG, which exhibits two kinds of magic angles. First, it hosts two exceptional magic angles at which the band structure changes from being purely real to purely imaginary, thereby featuring the flat bands in real energy and an infinite lifetime. In between them, the bands remained flattened, and Hermitian magic angle emerges, for which the imaginary part of the energy is maximal and directly corresponds with the usual magic angle in the non-dissipative, purely Hermitian TBG. Our results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open systems and should motivate studies of the interplay between the non-Hermitian effects and electron interactions in the NH moire bands.</description>

      <title>Focused deposition of levitated nanoscale Au droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for depositing nanoscale liquid Au droplets, initially levitated in an ion trap in high vacuum, onto a remote substrate. A levitated Au nanosphere is melted, expelled from the trap, and maintained in the molten state with a laser directed along the droplet trajectory until it reaches the substrate and rapidly solidifies. Also during transit, the charged droplets are focused to a small region of the substrate with an electrostatic lens. After deposition, the substrate can be removed from the vacuum chamber and imaged and analyzed by techniques such as electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Over 90% of launched particles are deposited on the substrate, and when the lens is focused, particles land in a region of diameter 120 $\mu$m after traversing a distance of 236 mm. Our technique is of value for analysis of materials prepared or processed while levitated that can be melted. Also, Au droplets may be useful as tracers for future experiments involving smaller projectiles or oriented solids.</description>

Abstract: The sensitivity of a gold-silver bilayer system for gas detection was investigated using angle-fixed reflectance measurements and numerical calculations based on the transfer-matrix method. Two configurations of bilayer systems were analyzed: gold on silver and silver on gold. According to calculations, the best sensitivity values were achieved with a total thickness of approximately 55 nm for the gold on silver system and approximately 65 nm for the silver on gold system. These calculations were supported by experimental results in a Kretschmann configuration for ethanol gas sensing. The bilayer systems showed a huge advantage compared to the widely used single gold thin film, however, special attention should be paid to the silver on gold configuration, as corrosion plays an important role in decreasing sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and averaged shadows</title>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as averaged shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have fabricated a device which includes two lateral p-n junctions on an n-type GaAs/Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$As heterostructure. A section of the n-type material has been converted to p-type by removing dopants and applying a voltage to a gate placed in this region. Controlled electroluminescence from both of the p-n junctions has been demonstrated by varying the applied bias voltages. An emission peak with a width of ~8 nm is observed around 812 nm. The electroluminescence seen from both junctions is considered to originate from the GaAs quantum well layer in the device. The lithographic techniques that we have developed are compatible for further integration of gated quantum devices such as single-electron pumps to build on-demand single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Structure and Stability of Oxide Nanoscrolls from Dichalcogenide Precursors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanoscrolls, and nanofilms have found applications in a wide variety of fields such as photocatalysis, sensing, and drug delivery. Recently, Chu et al. demonstrated that nanoscrolls of Mo and W transition metal oxides, which do not exhibit van der Waals (vdW) layering in their bulk counterparts, can be successfully synthesized using a plasma processing of corresponding layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we employ data mining, first-principles simulations, and physio-mechanical models to theoretically examine the potential of other dichalcogenide precursors to form oxide nanoscrolls. Through data mining of bulk and two-dimensional materials databases, we first identify dichalcogenides that would be mostly amenable to plasma processing on the basis of their vdW layering and thermodynamic stability. To determine the propensity of forming a nanoscroll, we develop a first-principles simulation-based physio-mechanical model to determine the thermodynamic stability of nanoscrolling as well as the equilibrium structure of the nanoscrolls, i.e. their inner radius, outer radius, and interlayer spacing. We validate this model using the experimental observations of Chu et al.'s study and find an excellent agreement for the equilibrium nanoscroll structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model's energies can be utilized for a generalized quantitative categorization of nanoscroll stability. We apply the model to study the oxide nanoscroll formation in MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, PdS$_2$, HfS$_2$ and GeS$_2$, paving the way for a systematic study of oxide nanoscroll formation atop other dichalcogenide substrates.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Imaging of Fractional Spinon Quasiparticles in Open-Shell Triangulene Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spinon quasiparticles, which carry spin but lack charge, is a hallmark of collective quantum phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems. While the existence of spinons has been demonstrated through scattering spectroscopy in ensemble samples, real-space imaging of these quasiparticles within individual spin chains has remained elusive. In this study, we construct individual Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains using open-shell [2]triangulene molecules as building blocks. Each [2]triangulene unit, owing to its sublattice imbalance, hosts a net spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ in accordance with Lieb's theorem, and these spins are antiferromagnetically coupled within covalent chains with a coupling strength of $J = 45$ meV. Through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we probe the spin states, excitation gaps, and their spatial excitation weights within covalent spin chains of varying lengths with atomic precision. Our investigation reveals that the excitation gap decreases as the chain length increases, extrapolating to zero for long chains, consistent with Haldane's gapless prediction. Moreover, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy reveals an m-shaped energy dispersion characteristic of confined spinon quasiparticles in a one-dimensional quantum box. These findings establish a promising strategy for exploring the unique properties of excitation quasiparticles and their broad implications for quantum information.</description>

      <title>Magnetophotonic waveguide nanostructure for selective ultrafast optical excitation of high-K spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomagnonics provides a promising method of a Joule-loss-free spin control that can be performed at ultrafast timescale. However, the cornerstone of optomagnonics is impossibility to focus the light tighter than a diffraction limit. This constrains minimal size of the optically switched magnetic bits and minimal wavelengths of the optically excited spin waves in optomagnonic devices thus preventing its further progress. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel method of the selective optical excitation of the short exchange spin waves by using a specially designed magnetophotonic grating. This method is based on the creation of the sign-changing profile of the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) induced in a magnetic film due to excitation of the optical guided TE-mode by a femtosecond laser pulse. The spatial period of the IFE profile is subdiffractive which allows to launch narrow band short spin waves whose wavelengths are around 300 nm as was experimentally demonstrated and potentially can be made down to ~ 100 nm. This opens new horizons for optomagnetic applications that are wide ranging, from logical elements to data processing devices.</description>

Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

      <title>Roles of the Narrow Electronic Band near the Fermi Level in 1T-TaS$_2$-Related Layered Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to reveal the roles of the narrow electronic band in two 1T-TaS$_2$-related materials (bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 4Hb-TaS$_2$). 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is a superconducting compound with alternating 1T-TaS$_2$ and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers, where the 1H-TaS$_2$ layer has weak charge density wave (CDW) pattern and reduces the CDW coupling between the adjacent 1T-TaS$_2$ layers. In the 1T-TaS$_2$ layer of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we observe a narrow electronic band located near Fermi level, and its spatial distribution is consistent with the tight-binding calculations for two-dimensional 1T-TaS$_2$ layers. The weak electronic hybridization between the 1T-TaS$_2$ and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shifts the narrow electronic band to be slightly above the Fermi level, which suppresses the electronic correlation induced band splitting. In contrast, in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$, there is an interlayer CDW coupling induced insulating gap. In comparison with the spatial distributions of the electronic states in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 4Hb-TaS$_2$, the insulating gap in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ results from the formation of a bonding band and an antibonding band due to the overlap of the narrow electronic bands in the dimerized 1T-TaS$_2$ layers.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e plane wave expansion model for scanning tunneling microscopy simulations of incommensurate two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incommensurate heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials, despite their attractive electronic behaviour, are challenging to simulate because of the absence of translation symmetry. Experimental investigations of these structures often employ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), however there is to date no comprehensive theory to simulate an STM image in such systems. In this paper, we present a geometry-based method to generate STM images in incommensurate van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which we call the moir\'e plane wave expansion model (MPWEM). We generate the STM images using a weighted sum of three image terms: the non-interacting STM images of (1) the substrate layer, (2) the adsorbate layer, and (3) a semi-empirical Fourier expansion of the moir\'e wavevectors obtained analytically which results from the interaction of (1) and (2). We illustrate and benchmark the model using selected vdW 2D systems composed of structurally and electronically distinct crystals, and show that the method reproduces experimental STM images down to angstrom-scale details. The MPWEM, thanks to its simplicity, can serve as an initial prediction tool prior to more computationally expensive calculations which are often limited by the number of atoms and the requirement of periodic supercells, and thus offers a promising class of computationally-friendly STM simulations, of high relevance in the growing field of twistronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composite fermion (CF) is a topological quasiparticle that emerges from a non-perturbative attachment of vortices to electrons in strongly correlated two-dimensional materials. Similar to non-interacting fermions that form Landau levels in a magnetic field, CFs can fill analogous ``Lambda'' levels, giving rise to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect of electrons. Here, we show that Lambda levels can be directly visualized through the characteristic peak structure in the signal obtained via spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a FQH state. Complementary to transport, which probes low-energy properties of CFs, we show that \emph{high-energy} features in STM spectra can be interpreted in terms of Lambda levels. We numerically demonstrate that STM spectra can be accurately modeled using Jain's CF theory. Our results show that STM provides a powerful tool for revealing the anatomy of FQH states and identifying physics beyond the non-interacting CF paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated flat bands with significantly quenched kinetic energy of electrons could give rise to exotic strongly correlated states from electron-electron interactions. More intriguingly, the interplay between topology and flat bands can further lead to richer physical phenomena, which have attracted much interest. Here, taking advantage of the recently proposed intertwined Dirac states induced from the anisotropic coupling between the top and bottom surface states of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin film, we show the emergence of a high-Chern-number (quasi)flat-band state through moir\'e engineering of the surface states. Remarkably, the flat bands are isolated from other bands and located near the Fermi level. Furthermore, topological phase transitions between trivial and nontrivial flat-band states can be driven by tuning the out-of-plane electric field. Our work not only proposes a new scheme to realize high-Chern-number flat-band states, but also highlights the versatility of the intertwined Dirac-cone states.</description>

      <title>Magnon transmission across $\nu=1|-1|1$ mono-layer graphene junction as a probe of electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnon transmission across gate-controlled junctions in the $n=0$ manifold of Landau levels in monolayer graphene, in the presence of both spin and valley Zeeman fields. Specifically, we consider the $1|-1|1$ sandwich geometry. The nature of the interfaces between regions of different filling turns out to be crucial for magnon transmission. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we find that either the spin or the valley degrees of freedom of the occupied one-body states rotate across the interfaces. If the interfaces exhibit spin rotation, magnon transmission is suppressed at high energies, while if the interfaces have valley rotation, magnon transmission becomes perfect at high energies. The valley Zeeman coupling, which arises from partial alignment with the encapsulating Boron Nitride, is independent of perpendicular magnetic field $B$, while the spin Zeeman and other anisotropic couplings scale linearly with $B$. This allows the tuning of the relative strength of the valley Zeeman coupling in situ by varying $B$, which can drive phase transitions of the interfaces between spin-rotated and valley-rotated phases, leading to magnon transmission being either vanishing or perfect at high energies. Our analysis, along with the experimental measurements, can be used to determine the anisotropic couplings in the sample.</description>

Abstract: We study nonlocal thermoelectricity in a superconducting wire subject to spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic field with a relative orientation $\theta$ between them. We calculate the current flowing in a normal probe attached to the bulk of a superconducting wire, as a result of a temperature difference applied at the ends of the wire. We focus on the linear response regime, corresponding to a small temperature bias. We find that the nonlocal thermoelectric response is strongly dependent on the angle $\theta$ and occurs in ranges which correspond to the emergence of Bogoliubov Fermi points in the energy spectrum of the superconducting wire.</description>

Abstract: Engineering superlattices (SLs) - which are spatially periodic potential landscapes for electrons - is an emerging approach for the realization of exotic properties, including superconductivity and correlated insulators, in two-dimensional materials. While moir\'e SL engineering has been a popular approach, nanopatterning is an attractive alternative offering control over the pattern and wavelength of the SL. However, the disorder arising in the system due to imperfect nanopatterning is seldom studied. Here, by creating a square lattice of nanoholes in the $SiO_2$ dielectric layer using nanolithography, we study the superlattice potential and the disorder formed in hBN-graphene-hBN heterostructures. Specifically, we observe that while electrical transport shows distinct superlattice satellite peaks, the disorder of the device is significantly higher than graphene devices without any SL. We use finite-element simulations combined with a resistor network model to calculate the effects of this disorder on the transport properties of graphene. We consider three types of disorder: nanohole size variations, adjacent nanohole mergers, and nanohole vacancies. Comparing our experimental results with the model, we find that the disorder primarily originates from nanohole size variations rather than nanohole mergers in square SLs. We further confirm the validity of our model by comparing the results with quantum transport simulations. Our findings highlight the applicability of our simple framework to predict and engineer disorder in patterned SLs, specifically correlating variations in the resultant SL patterns to the observed disorder. Our combined experimental and theoretical results could serve as a valuable guide for optimizing nanofabrication processes to engineer disorder in nanopatterned SLs.</description>

      <title>Violating Bell's inequality in gate-defined quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superior computational power promised by quantum computers utilises the fundamental quantum mechanical principle of entanglement. However, achieving entanglement and verifying that the generated state does not follow the principle of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence values and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's inequality. Here we employ heralded initialization and calibration via gate set tomography (GST), to reduce all relevant errors and push the fidelities of the full 2-qubit gate set above 99 %, including state preparation and measurement (SPAM). We demonstrate a 97.17 % Bell state fidelity without correcting for readout errors and violate Bell's inequality with a Bell signal of S = 2.731 close to the theoretical maximum of $2\sqrt{2}$. Our measurements exceed the classical limit even at elevated temperatures of 1.1 K or entanglement lifetimes of 100 $\mu s$.</description>

      <title>Skin effect in Non-Hermitian systems with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skin effect, where bulk modes collapse into boundary modes, is a key phenomenon in topological non-Hermitian systems, has been predominantly studied in spinless systems. Recent studies illustrate the magnetic suppression of the first-order skin effect while ignoring spin. However, the physical significance of a magnetic field in non-Hermitian skin effect with spin remains elusive. Here, we systematically explore non-Hermitian spinful systems based on generalized Hatano-Nelson models with SU(2) gauge potential fields. In an open one-dimensional lattice, the spin-up and spin-down states can be uniquely separated and localized at the two boundaries without magnetic field. When an external magnetic field is applied, the skin effect exhibits a smooth transition from bidirectional to unidirectional. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the first-order skin effect can be anomalously induced by a magnetic field in a topologically trivial non-Hermitian spinful system without any skin effect at zero field. The direction of such magnetically induced skin modes can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude and polarity of the magnetic field. In addition, we demonstrate a transition between non-Bloch PT and anti-PT symmetries in the system, and uncover the spindependent mechanism of non-Bloch PT symmetry. Our results pave the way for the investigation of non-Hermitian skin effect with spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale modeling of deformations and defects in thin crystalline sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale description of deformations and defects in thin, flexible sheets with crystalline order, tackling the interplay between in-plane elasticity, out-of-plane deformation, as well as dislocation nucleation and motion. Our approach is based on the Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model, which describes the microscopic atomic density in crystals at diffusive timescales, naturally encoding elasticity and plasticity effects. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), a coarse-grained description of the mechanical properties of crystals is achieved. We introduce surface PFC and surface APFC models in a convenient height-function formulation encoding deformation in the normal direction. This framework is proven consistent with classical aspects of strain-induced buckling, defect nucleation on deformed surfaces, and out-of-plane relaxation near dislocations. In particular, we benchmark and discuss the results of numerical simulations by looking at the continuum limit for buckling under uniaxial compression and at evidence from microscopic models for deformation at defects and defect arrangements, demonstrating the scale-bridging capabilities of the proposed framework. Results concerning the interplay between lattice distortion at dislocations and out-of-plane deformation are also illustrated by looking at the annihilation of dislocation dipoles and systems hosting many dislocations. With the novel formulation proposed here, and its assessment with established approaches, we envision applications to multiscale investigations of crystalline order on deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Kerr nonlinearity and parametric amplification with an Al-InAs superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly quantum limited Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) are essential components in superconducting quantum circuits. However, higher order nonlinearities of the Josephson cosine potential are known to cause gain compression, therefore limiting scalability. In an effort to reduce the fourth order, or Kerr nonlinearity, we realize a parametric amplifier with an Al-InAs superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junction (JJ). We extract the Kerr nonlinearity of the Al-InAs JJ from two different devices and show that it is three orders of magnitude lower compared to an Al-$\text{AlO}_\text{X}$ junction with identical Josephson inductance. We then demonstrate a four-wave-mixing (4WM) parametric amplifier made with an Al-InAs junction that achieves more than 20 dB of gain and -119 dBm of compression power, that outperforms single resonant JPAs based on Al junctions.</description>

      <title>Resonant-force induced symmetry breaking in a quantum parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases including the prebifurcation regime where the system is close but not too close to the bifurcation point.</description>

      <title>Constructive Fermionic Matrix Product States for Projected Fermi Sea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>
