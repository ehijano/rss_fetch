      <title>FramePrompt: In-context Controllable Animation with Zero Structural Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating controllable character animation from a reference image and motion guidance remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulty of injecting appearance and motion cues into video diffusion models. Prior works often rely on complex architectures, explicit guider modules, or multi-stage processing pipelines, which increase structural overhead and hinder deployment. Inspired by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained models for controllable animation without architectural changes.</description>

      <title>BlenderFusion: 3D-Grounded Visual Editing and Generative Compositing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original (source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering, facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing tasks.</description>

      <title>3D Gaussian Splatting for Fine-Detailed Surface Reconstruction in Large-Scale Scene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will be available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Texture Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering (STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics, this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve zero-error filtering using &lt;=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Auto-Regressive Surface Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However, existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean boundaries for part decomposition.</description>

      <title>Morse: Dual-Sampling for Lossless Acceleration of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

      <title>What You Think Is What You Get: Bridge User Intent and Transfer Function Design through Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space. Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap. However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically, we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at: https://github.com/wyysteelhead/TFevolve.</description>

      <title>BulletGen: Improving 4D Reconstruction with Bullet-Time Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges, e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model. Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>DuetGen: Music Driven Two-Person Dance Generation via Hierarchical Masked Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution, producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels. Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.</description>

      <title>A B-Spline Finite Element Method for Cloth Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a B-spline finite element method (FEM) for cloth simulation. Building on quadratic B-spline basis functions, our method provides a globally $C^1$-continuous displacement field, enabling consistent and accurate discretization of both membrane and bending energies. This smooth representation effectively mitigates locking artifacts and mesh dependency issues commonly observed with linear FEM. To further improve efficiency, we develop a reduced integration scheme that separately optimizes quadrature rules for membrane and bending energies, further reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating improved accuracy, visual quality, and efficiency compared to linear FEM and recent higher-order methods. Our method enables realistic simulation of complex wrinkling dynamics across varying material parameters, offering a promising new spatial discretization for cloth simulation.</description>

      <title>TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated video generation continues its journey through the uncanny valley to produce content that is increasingly perceptually indistinguishable from reality. To better protect individuals, organizations, and societies from its malicious applications, we describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion using multi-modal semantic embeddings. Our method is robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches, including resolution and compression attacks. This method is evaluated against DeepAction, a custom-built, open-sourced dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage. The dataset is available under an academic license at https://www.huggingface.co/datasets/faridlab/deepaction_v1.</description>

      <title>CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain, and storage costs are substantial. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>
