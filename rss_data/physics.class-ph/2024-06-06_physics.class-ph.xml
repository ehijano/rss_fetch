      <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non-Hermitian physics. Although it is established that one-dimensional NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology, the topological origin behind the higher-dimensional NHSE remains unclear so far. This poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high-dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom-to-top scheme to construct high-dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent one-dimensional NHSEs. Not only the elusive high-dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well-defined one-dimensional spectral winding topologies, but also the high-dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the one-dimensional counterparts. As examples, two two-dimensional nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi-polar NHSEs and hybrid skin-topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency-selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high-dimensional NHSEs, which could boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Hot spot as hallmark of transition from dielectric disk to ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological transformations of dielectric structures radically change the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of photonic resonances. Moreover, optical effects may arise that characterize the moment of transition from one structure to another, but are not inherent in either the initial or final structure. We demonstrate that such a hallmark of the disk-ring transition is a hot spot of a special nature that arises at the moment a central hole appears in the disk. The hot spot in the air hole is caused by the Mie resonance of the disk with azimuthal number $m$ = 1, while other Mie resonances do not contribute to the effect due to symmetry. As the hole increases, the hot spot fades out, and we theoretically and experimentally observe the formation of photonic resonances of the ring from resonances of the disk. Using near-field and far-field measurements, we discovered clustering of disk photonic modes into distinct galleries of ring eigenmodes that are formed by the inner and outer walls of the cavity. Thus, we demonstrate both the beginning and the end of the rearrangement of photonic eigenmodes during the transition from a dielectric disk to a narrow ring.</description>

      <title>On the covariance of the d'Alembert equation: the cases of sound and light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariance of the d'Alembert equation for acoustic phenomena, described by mechanical waves in one or three spatial dimensions, under Galilean transformations, is demonstrated without the need to abandon the hypothesis that time is absolute in Classical Mechanics. This is true only if and only if the phase velocity of sound depends on the velocity of the observer. On the other hand, it is also shown that the same d'Alembert equation is covariant under Lorentz transformations if and only if the phase velocity of light does not depend on the observer.</description>

      <title>A hybrid numerical methodology coupling Reduced Order Modeling and Graph Neural Networks for non-parametric geometries: applications to structural dynamics problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new approach for accelerating the numerical analysis of time-domain partial differential equations (PDEs) governing complex physical systems. The methodology is based on a combination of a classical reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework and recently-introduced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the latter is trained on highly heterogeneous databases of varying numerical discretization sizes. The proposed techniques are shown to be particularly suitable for non-parametric geometries, ultimately enabling the treatment of a diverse range of geometries and topologies. Performance studies are presented in an application context related to the design of aircraft seats and their corresponding mechanical responses to shocks, where the main motivation is to reduce the computational burden and enable the rapid design iteration for such problems that entail non-parametric geometries. The methods proposed here are straightforwardly applicable to other scientific or engineering problems requiring a large number of finite element-based numerical simulations, with the potential to significantly enhance efficiency while maintaining reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Coupled thermoelastic isotropic laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider in this paper the general properties of laminates designed to be isotropic in extension and in bending and with a coupling between the in- and out-of plane responses. In particular, we analyze the mathematical properties of the tensors describing the elastic and thermal behavior and the mechanical consequences of these properties. The differences, from the mathematical and mechanical point of view, between the hybrid laminates, i.e. composed by layers of different materials, and those made of identical plies, are pointed out and analyzed. The polar formalism for planar tensors is used in this study.</description>
