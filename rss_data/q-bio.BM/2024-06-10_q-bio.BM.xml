      <title>SynAsk: Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), revolutionizing various language tasks and applications, and the integration of LLM into specialized domains enhances their capabilities for domain-specific applications. Notably, NLP has made significant strides in organic chemistry, particularly in predicting synthetic tasks, paving the way for the development of LLMs tailored to the organic chemistry field. In this work, we introduce SynAsk, a comprehensive organic chemistry domain-specific LLM platform developed by AIChemEco Inc. By finetuning an LLM with domain-specific data and integrating it with a chain of thought approach, SynAsk seamlessly accesses our knowledge base and advanced chemistry tools in a question-and-answer format. This includes functionalities such as a basic chemistry knowledge base, molecular information retrieval, reaction performance prediction, retrosynthesis prediction, chemical literature acquisition, and more. This novel methodology synergizes fine-tuning techniques with external resource integration, resulting in an organic chemistry-specific model poised to facilitate research and discovery in the field. Accessible via http://synask.aichemeco.com, SynAsk represents a significant advancement in leveraging NLP for synthetic applications.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude against the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>
