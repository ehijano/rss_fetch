      <title>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>
