      <title>Geospatial and Symbolic Hypothesis for the Foundation of Tenochtitlan Based on Digital Elevation Analysis of the Valley of Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hypothesis about the foundation of Tenochtitlan by combining digital elevation modeling with historical and symbolic analysis. Using geospatial data from EarthExplorer, we simulate various historical water levels in the Valley of Mexico. The resulting lake configurations reveal possible locations for ancient settlements near now-vanished shorelines, suggesting a dynamic transformation of sacred geography that aligns with key Mexica myths. We identify Santa Mar\'ia Aztahuacan as a strong candidate for the historical Aztlan and propose a reinterpretation of foundational codices in light of geomythical correlations.</description>

      <title>Adaptation and synchronization -- basic mechanisms in music performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines the roles of adaptation and synchronization in music performance, drawing on concepts from complex systems theory to understand the dynamic interactions between musicians, music, and listeners. Adaptation is explored through how musicians adjust their cognitive, emotional, and motor systems across the stages of preparation, execution, and reception, while synchronization is emphasized as essential for aligning internal states, coordinating actions with other performers, and engaging with the audience. The review highlights the interdisciplinary nature of music performance research, integrating cognitive, motor, and emotional processes to enhance both individual and collective musical expression. It also addresses the psychological state of flow, which arises from synchronized neurocognitive mechanisms that optimize performance. Additionally, the emotional synchronization facilitated by music is explored, emphasizing its role in both individual emotional coherence and social coordination within musical ensembles. Finally, the review highlights recent findings on interpersonal and inter-brain synchronization, particularly in live music performances and improvisation, showing how synchronization fosters creativity, social cohesion, and a shared collective experience.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understand modern day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemic spreading. However, they are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically in a general way. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics which significantly simplifies the problem and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on a network. This provides a theoretical tool that allows to study dynamic processes on networks broadly without loosing sight of known results.</description>

      <title>Modeling resource consumption in the US air transportation system via minimum-cost percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic percolation model aimed at describing the consumption, and eventual exhaustion, of resources in transportation networks. In the model, rational agents progressively consume the edges of a network along demanded minimum-cost paths. As a result, the network undergoes a transition between a percolating phase where it can properly serve demand to a non-percolating phase where demand can no longer be supplied. We apply the model to a weighted, directed, temporal, multi-layer network representation of the air transportation system that can be generated using real schedules of commercial flights operated by US carriers. We study how cooperation among different carriers could improve the ability of the overall air transportation system in serving the demand of passengers, finding that unrestricted cooperation could lead to a 30% efficiency increase compared to the non-cooperative scenario. Cooperation would require major airlines to share a significant portion of their market, but it would allow also for an increased robustness of the system against perturbations causing flight cancellations. Our findings underscore some key benefits that could emerge by simply promoting code-share arrangements among US airlines without altering their current cost of operation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Collective Stability of ACC Systems: From Theory to Real-World Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomated vehicles (AVs) are expected to have a profound impact on society, with high expectations for their potential benefits. One key anticipated benefit is the reduction of traffic congestion and stop-and-go waves, which negatively affect fuel efficiency, travel time, and environmental sustainability. This paper presents a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the impact of AVs on the longitudinal collective stability of vehicle single file. We focus on adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, a widely used precursor technology to fully autonomous driving. ACC controllers have been studied extensively in both theoretical and practical contexts, making it a valuable starting point for analysis. Our study systematically differentiates the findings from models and simulations, controlled experiments, and empirical observations to provide a structured overview of existing research. Although some results in the literature are contradictory, three key insights emerge from our analysis: i) String stability is highly dependent on the chosen time gap and reaction/response time. ii) ACC systems currently implemented in commercial vehicles are not string stable, as manufacturers prioritise individual comfort and smooth driving, resulting in high system response times. iii) Although cooperative ACC (CACC) systems are theoretically the most effective solution to ensure string stability, their widespread implementation in the near future remains uncertain. Instead, improvements in autonomous control algorithms should be considered to enhance system performance.</description>

      <title>Assess Space-Based Solar Power in European-Scale Power System Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting net-zero targets remains formidable as terrestrial renewables grapple with intermittency and regional variability. Here, we integrate space-based solar power (SBSP) -- a potential near-constant, orbital solar technology -- into a high-resolution, Europe-wide capacity-expansion and dispatch model to quantify its contribution under net-zero constraints. We examine two advanced SBSP designs: (1) a near-baseload, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) concept (heliostat-based Representative Design RD1) and (2) a partially intermittent, higher-TRL concept (planar-based RD2), both drawing on NASA's 2050 cost and performance projections. Our results show that RD1 can reduce total system costs by 7--15%, displace up to 80% of intermittent wind and solar, and cut battery usage by over 70%, if it meets its forecast cost reductions -- though long-duration storage (e.g., hydrogen) remains essential for seasonal balancing. By contrast, RD2 is economically unattractive at its projected 2050 costs. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, we identify cost thresholds at which SBSP shifts from cost-prohibitive to complementary and ultimately to a dominant baseload technology. Specifically, RD1 becomes complementary at roughly 14x and dominant at 9x the 2050 solar PV capital cost, benefiting from its continuous power generation. Meanwhile, RD2 must achieve even lower cost levels (9x to be complementary and 6x to dominate) and would rely on short-duration storage to mitigate its partial intermittency. These findings provide quantified techno-economic benchmarks and reveal alternative net-zero pathways, offering critical guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders seeking large-scale, centrally coordinated renewable solutions with non- or low-intermittency.</description>

      <title>Group-Level Imitation May Stabilize Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing cooperation among self-interested individuals presents a fundamental challenge in evolutionary theory and social science. While classical models predict the dominance of defection in social dilemmas, empirical and theoretical studies have identified various mechanisms that promote cooperation, including kin selection, reciprocity, and spatial structure. In this work, we investigate the role of localized imitation in the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation within an optional Public Goods Game (PGG). We introduce a model where individuals belong to distinct groups and adapt their strategies based solely on comparisons within their own group. We identify different dynamical regimes, including stable fixed points, limit cycles, and Rock-Scissors-Paper-type oscillations. Our analysis, grounded in a replicator-type framework, reveals that such group-level imitation can stabilize cooperative behavior, provided that groups are not initially polarized around a single strategy. In other words, restricting imitation to group-level interactions mitigates the destabilizing effects of global competition, providing a potential explanation for the resilience of cooperation in structured populations.</description>

      <title>Capturing AI's Attention: Physics of Repetition, Hallucination, Bias and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a first-principles physics theory of the AI engine at the heart of LLMs' 'magic' (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude): the basic Attention head. The theory allows a quantitative analysis of outstanding AI challenges such as output repetition, hallucination and harmful content, and bias (e.g. from training and fine-tuning). Its predictions are consistent with large-scale LLM outputs. Its 2-body form suggests why LLMs work so well, but hints that a generalized 3-body Attention would make such AI work even better. Its similarity to a spin-bath means that existing Physics expertise could immediately be harnessed to help Society ensure AI is trustworthy and resilient to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Unifying Physics- and Data-Driven Modeling via Novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for effective disease control and prevention. Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>

      <title>Societal self-regulation induces complex infection dynamics and chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classically, endemic infectious diseases are expected to display relatively stable, predictable infection dynamics. Accordingly, basic disease models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model display stable endemic states or recurrent seasonal waves. However, if the human population reacts to high infection numbers by mitigating the spread of the disease, then this delayed behavioral feedback loop can generate infection waves itself, driven by periodic mitigation and subsequent relaxation. We show that such behavioral reactions, together with a seasonal effect of comparable impact, can cause complex and unpredictable infection dynamics, including Arnold tongues, coexisting attractors, and chaos. Importantly, these arise in epidemiologically relevant parameter regions where the costs associated to infections and mitigation are jointly minimized. By comparing our model to data, we find signs that COVID-19 was mitigated in a way that favored complex infection dynamics. Our results challenge the intuition that endemic disease dynamics necessarily implies predictability and seasonal waves and show the emergence of complex infection dynamics when humans optimize their reaction to increasing infection numbers.</description>
