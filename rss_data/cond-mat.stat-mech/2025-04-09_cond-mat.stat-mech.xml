      <title>Performance optimization of Nernst-based thermionic engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the power and efficiency of the thermionic device utilizing the Nernst effect, with a specific focus on its potential application as an engine. The device operates by utilizing the vertical heat current to generate a horizontal particle current against the chemical potential. By considering the influence of a strong magnetic field, we derive analytical expressions for the current and heat flux. These expressions are dependent on the temperature and chemical potential of heat reservoirs, providing valuable insights into the device performance. The impact of driving temperatures on the performance of the thermionic engine has been assessed through numerical analysis. The research findings will guide the experimental design of Nernst-based thermionic engines.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, detailed balance, and stress-structure correlations in 2D granular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a number of recent experimental and numerical observations point to an ongoing cooperative stress-structure self-organisation (SO) in quasi-static granular dynamics. These observations include: a) detail-insensitive collapses of certain quantities; b) correlations between stress and structure and evidence of entropy-stability competition in settled packings, which cast doubt on most linear stress theories of granular materials; c) detailed balanced steady states, which seem contradictory to the common belief that only systems in thermal equilibrium satisfy detailed balance, but are not, as we explain. We then propose a new statistical mechanical formulation that takes into account the cooperative SO.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability flow equivalence technique, we rigorously derive an entropy production decomposition formula and demonstrate that the entropy production, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies the integral fluctuation theorem $\langle \exp[ -\Delta s_\mathrm{tot} + B_\mathrm{act}] \rangle = 1$ and the generalized second law of thermodynamics $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}\rangle \geq\langle B_\mathrm{act}\rangle$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with the active fluctuations. Our result holds generally for arbitrary initial conditions, encompassing both steady-state and transient finite-time regimes. In the limiting case where active fluctuations are absent (i.e., $B_\mathrm{act} \equiv 0$), the theorem reduces to the well-established results in stochastic thermodynamics. Building on the theoretical foundation, we propose a deep learning-based methodology to efficiently compute the entropy production, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score function we proposed. To illustrate the validity of this approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer system consisting of an active Brownian particle cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our results provide a unified framework for analyzing entropy production in active matter systems while offering practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behaviors.</description>

      <title>Response to an external field of a generalized Langevin equation with stochastic resetting of the memory kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) framework that incorporates stochastic resetting of a truncation power-law memory kernel. The inclusion of stochastic resetting enables the emergence of resonance phenomena even in parameter regimes where conventional settings (without resetting) do not exhibit such behavior. Specifically, we explore the response of the system to an external field under three scenarios: (i) a free particle, (ii) a particle in a harmonic potential, and (iii) the effect of truncation in the memory kernel. In each case, the primary focus is on understanding how the resetting mechanism interacts with standard parameters to induce stochastic resonance. In addition, we explore the effect of resetting on the dielectric loss.</description>

      <title>Emergent Theory for Constitutive Relations in Classical Defect Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical, acoustic, hydrodynamic, and thermal defect systems are often studied by analogy with each other. This may indicate that we may find a emergent theory for constitutive relations of classical defect systems. Start with thermal systems, we put up with a bootstrap method to describe classical transport. We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat constitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that the corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form of that of Wick-rotated complex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit, and only in perfect conducting situation that this system is a canonical ensemble. We argue that our method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By analogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a conserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is qualitatively discussed in this model.</description>

      <title>Exact Current Fluctuations in a Tight-Binding Chain with Dephasing Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and $\rho_b$ on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial parameter dependence, referred to as the $\omega$-dependence, of the moment generating function for the integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Harnessing non-equilibrium forces to optimize work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While optimal control theory offers effective strategies for minimizing energetic costs in noisy microscopic systems over finite durations, a significant opportunity lies in exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces. We demonstrate this by presenting exact analytical forms for the optimal protocol and the corresponding work for any driving force and protocol duration. We also derive a general quasistatic bound on the work, relying only on the coarse-grained, time-integrated characteristics of the applied forces. Notably, we show that the optimal protocols often automatically act as information engines that harness information about non-equilibrium forces and an initial state measurement to extract work. These findings chart new directions for designing adaptive, energy-efficient strategies in noisy, time-dependent environments, as illustrated through our examples of periodic driving forces and active matter systems. By exploiting the temporal structure of non-equilibrium forces, this largely unexplored approach holds promise for substantial performance gains in microscopic devices operating at the nano- and microscale.</description>

      <title>PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20071v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI{\dag} and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Have you tried turning it off and on again? Stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used across chemistry, physics, and biology, providing quantitative insight into complex processes with atomic detail. However, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a significant obstacle in describing phenomena such as conformational transitions of biomolecules and polymorphism in molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic resetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restarting the simulations, emerged as a powerful enhanced sampling approach, which is collective variable-free, highly parallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes. Resetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference of kinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a standalone tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as Metadynamics, with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other. Here, we comprehensively describe resetting and its theoretical background, review recent developments in stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and provide instructive guidelines for practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid, using an expansion in the codimension of both the Fermi and Bose surfaces. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Relativistic Self-Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in physics is that of calculating the motion of $N$ particles under a specified mutual force: the $N$-body problem. Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in turn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Coherence-decoherence interplay in quantum systems due to projective stochastic pulses: The case of Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a putative model of black holes as quantum objects we consider what types of operators would have a corresponding spectrum. We find that there are indeed such operators, but of a rather unusual types, and for which the wave functions are only barely localized. We point out a tension between such almost delocalized states and black holes as compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed. The NATT scheme, by construction, has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Numerical renormalization of glassy dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids by analyzing crystal deformations through non-affine fluctuations. A scaling law for non-affinity is derived, showing it scales quadratically with activity and inversely with density. At high activity, the non-affine parameter diverges, signaling defect proliferation and melting to a hexatic phase. This softening is marked by reduced shear modulus, solid order, and hexatic order. At a higher activity, the hexatic melts to a fluid. We propose locally tuned activity to control non-affinity, demonstrated through numerical simulations. Our predictions are testable in active colloids performing persistent random motion.</description>

      <title>Exact Ground States of Two Dimensional $\pm J$ Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact analytical expressions for the ground-state energy and entropy of the two-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin glass, uncovering a nested hierarchy of frustrations. Each level in this hierarchy contributes through the kernel and pseudo-determinant of effective operators, capturing the energy and entropy, respectively. At leading order, the structure coincides with geometric plaquette frustrations, while subleading corrections arise from magnetic adjacency matrices defined on percolated clusters in the dual lattice. Our results, supported by numerical simulations, provide a systematic framework for analyzing spin-glass ground states and offer new insight into glass order in finite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for fluidic flocks in interacting active colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Finding possible mechanisms of attaining a global polar order via dynamical mechanisms - without any explicit alignment interaction - is an area of active current research. Here, we report a flocking transition sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities in a system of chemically interacting colloidal particles. The basic requirements to sustain the flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques, with the time scale individual colloids move a unit length being dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. The generality of this phenomenon is displayed for a range of attractive translational forces to which the flock is robust. We rationalize these results with a phenomenological hydrodynamical model.</description>

      <title>Chapman-Enskog theory and crossover between diffusion and superdiffusion for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann approach to integrability-breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with a collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. For length scales larger than $\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is integrability-breaking parameter, we recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity. At even larger length scales, this description crosses over to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, characteristic to generic non-integrable one-dimensional fluids. Employing nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics we estimate this crossover length scale as $ \sim \lambda^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Typical reconstruction limit and phase transition of maximum entropy method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the maximum entropy method (MEM) reconstruction performance on the default model. The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through dynamic quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicate a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>
