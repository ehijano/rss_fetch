      <title>$A$-approximate point spectrum of $A$-bounded operators in semi-Hilbertian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into several characterizations of $A$-approximate point spectrum of A-bounded operators acting on a complex semi-Hilbertian space $H$ and also investigates properties of the $A$-approximate point spectrum for the tensor product of two $A^{\frac{1}{2}}$-adjoint operators. Furthermore, several properties of $A$-normal operators have been established.</description>

      <title>Weak property $(\mathrm{T}_{L^p})$ for discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for a countable discrete group $\Gamma$, property $(\mathrm{T}_{L^p})$ of Bader, Furman, Gelander and Monod is equivalent to the property that, whenever an $L^p$-representation of $\Gamma$ admits a net of almost invariant unit vectors, it has a non-zero invariant vector. Central in the proof is to show that the closure of the group of $\mathbb{T}$-valued $1$-coboundaries is a sufficient criteria for strong ergodicity of ergodic p.m.p. actions.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue estimates for Fourier concentration operators on two domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study concentration operators associated with either the discrete or the continuous Fourier transform, that is, operators that incorporate a spatial cut-off and a subsequent frequency cut-off to the Fourier inversion formula. Their spectral profiles describe the number of prominent degrees of freedom in problems where functions are assumed to be supported on a certain domain and their Fourier transforms are known or measured on a second domain.
  We derive eigenvalue estimates that quantify the extent to which Fourier concentration operators deviate from orthogonal projectors, by bounding the number of eigenvalues that are away from 0 and 1 in terms of the geometry of the spatial and frequency domains, and a factor that grows at most poly-logarithmically on the inverse of the spectral margin. The estimates are non-asymptotic in the sense that they are applicable to concrete domains and spectral thresholds, and almost match asymptotic benchmarks.
  Our work covers for the first time non-convex and non-symmetric spatial and frequency concentration domains, as demanded by numerous applications that exploit the expected approximate low dimensionality of the modeled phenomena. The proofs build on Israel's work on one dimensional intervals [arXiv: 1502.04404v1]. The new ingredients are the use of redundant wave-packet expansions and a dyadic decomposition argument to obtain Schatten norm estimates for Hankel operators.</description>

      <title>Polynomial growth and functional calculus in algebras of integrable cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group with polynomial growth of order $d$, a polynomial weight $\nu$ on ${\sf G}$ and a Fell bundle $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$. We study the Banach $^*$-algebras $L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ and $L^{1,\nu}({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$, consisting of integrable cross-sections with respect to ${\rm d} x$ and $\nu(x){\rm d} x$, respectively. By exploring new relations between the $L^p$-norms and the norm of the Hilbert $C^*$-module $L^2_{\sf e}({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$, we are able to develop a smooth functional calculus for the self-adjoint, compactly-supported, continuous cross-sections and estimate the growth of the semigroups they generate by $$\| e^{it\Phi} \|=O(|t|^{2d+2}),\quad\text{ as }|t|\to\infty.$$ We also give some sufficient conditions for these algebras to be symmetric. As consequences, we show that these algebras are locally regular, $^*$-regular and have the Wiener property (when symmetric), among other results.
  Our results are already new for convolution algebras $L_\alpha^1({\sf G},{\mathfrak A})$ associated with a $C^*$-dynamical system $({\sf G},\mathfrak A,\alpha)$. As an application, we show that Hahn algebras of transformation groupoids where the acting group has polynomial growth are $^*$-regular. On an appendix, we also use our techniques to compute the spectral radius of some cross-sections associated with groups of subexponential growth and show that compact groups are hypersymmetric.</description>

      <title>Formation of multiple flocks in a simple nonlocal aggregation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of interaction energies given by kernels having a ''well-barrier'' shape, and investigate how these kernels drive the formation of multiple flocks within a larger population. We use the dichotomy case of the concentration compactness principle to obtain an energy minimizer, even though minimizing sequences are expected to break apart into flocks which may move far away from one another.</description>

      <title>s-stability for W^{s,n/s}-harmonic maps in homotopy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $s$-dependence for minimizing $W^{s,n/s}$-harmonic maps $u\colon \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^\ell$ in homotopy classes. Sacks--Uhlenbeck theory shows that, for each $s$, minimizers exist in a generating subset of $\pi_{n}(\mathbb{S}^\ell)$. We show that this generating subset can be chosen locally constant in $s$. We also show that as $s$ varies the minimal $W^{s,n/s}$-energy in each homotopy class changes continuously. In particular, we provide progress to a question raised by Mironescu and Brezis--Mironescu.</description>
