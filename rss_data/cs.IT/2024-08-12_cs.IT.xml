      <title>Sparsely Pre-transformed Polar Codes for Low-Latency SCL Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep polar codes, employing multi-layered polar kernel pre-transforms in series, are recently introduced variants of pre-transformed polar codes. These codes have demonstrated the ability to reduce the number of minimum weight codewords, thereby closely achieving finite-block length capacity with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders in certain scenarios. However, when the list size of the SCL decoder is small, which is crucial for low-latency communication applications, the reduction in the number of minimum weight codewords does not necessarily improve decoding performance. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative pre-transform technique to enhance the suitability of polar codes for SCL decoders with practical list sizes. Leveraging the fact that the SCL decoding error event set can be decomposed into two exclusive error event sets, our approach applies two different types of pre-transformations, each targeting the reduction of one of the two error event sets. Extensive simulation results under various block lengths and code rates have demonstrated that our codes consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art pre-transformed polar codes, including CRC-aided polar codes and polarization-adjusted convolutional codes, when decoded using SCL decoders with small list sizes.</description>

      <title>Linear Complementary Equi-Dual Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a linear code $C$ with length $n$ over a field $F$, a linear complementary equi-dual code, when there exists a linear code $D$ over $F$ such that $D$ is permutation equivalent to $C^\perp$ and $(C,D)$ is a linear complementary pair of codes, that is, $C+ D=F^n$ and $C\cap D=0$. We first state a necessary condition on a code $C$ to be linear complementary equi-dual. Then, we conjecture that this necessary condition is also sufficient and present several statements which support this conjecture.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Temporal GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks, a new and trending area of machine learning, suffers from a lack of formal analysis. In this paper, information theory is used as the primary tool to provide a framework for the analysis of temporal GNNs. For this reason, the concept of information bottleneck is used and adjusted to be suitable for a temporal analysis of such networks. To this end, a new definition for Mutual Information Rate is provided, and the potential use of this new metric in the analysis of temporal GNNs is studied.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced AF Relaying: Two-Stage Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA) technology has attracted increasing attention in wireless communications due to its capability for flexibly adjusting the positions of multiple antennas in a local region to reconfigure channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate its application in an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system, where a multi-MA AF relay is deployed to assist in the wireless communications from a source to a destination. In particular, we aim to maximize the achievable rate at the destination, by jointly optimizing the AF weight matrix at the relay and its MAs' positions in two stages for receiving the signal from the source and transmitting its amplified version to the destination, respectively. However, compared to the existing one-stage antenna position optimization, the two-stage position optimization is more challenging due to its intricate coupling in the achievable rate at the destination. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the considered problem into several subproblems by invoking the alternating optimization (AO) and solve them by using the semidefinite programming and the gradient ascent. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over the conventional relaying system with fixed-position antennas (FPAs) and also drive essential insights.</description>

      <title>Divergence Maximizing Linear Projection for Supervised Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two linear projection methods for supervised dimension reduction using only the first and second-order statistics. The methods, each catering to a different parameter regime, are derived under the general Gaussian model by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two classes in the projected sample for a binary classification problem. They subsume existing linear projection approaches developed under simplifying assumptions of Gaussian distributions, such as these distributions might share an equal mean or covariance matrix. As a by-product, we establish that the multi-class linear discriminant analysis, a celebrated method for classification and supervised dimension reduction, is provably optimal for maximizing pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence when the Gaussian populations share an identical covariance matrix. For the case when the Gaussian distributions share an equal mean, we establish conditions under which the optimal subspace remains invariant regardless of how the Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined, despite the asymmetry of the divergence measure itself. Such conditions encompass the classical case of signal plus noise, where both the signal and noise have zero mean and arbitrary covariance matrices. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed solutions, demonstrate their superior performance over existing alternatives, and illustrate the procedure for selecting the appropriate linear projection solution.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Based Active User Enumeration for Grant-Free Access Under Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) system in the presence of carrier frequency offsets. We propose two schemes for enumerating active users in such a GF-NOMA system, which is equivalent to estimating the sparsity level. Both schemes utilize a short common pilot and the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. The two schemes differ in their treatment of noise variance: one exploits known variance information, while the other is designed to function without this knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in terms of the normalized mean-squared error.</description>

      <title>Testing the Isotropic Cauchy Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotropic $\alpha$-stable distributions are central in the theory of heavy-tailed distributions and play a role similar to that of the Gaussian density among finite second-moment laws. Given a sequence of $n$ observations, we are interested in characterizing the performance of Likelihood Ratio Tests where two hypotheses are plausible for the observed quantities: either isotropic Cauchy or isotropic Gaussian. Under various setups, we show that the probability of error of such detectors is not always exponentially decaying with $n$ with the leading term in the exponent shown to be logarithmic instead and we determine the constants in that leading term. Perhaps surprisingly, the optimal Bayesian probabilities of error are found to exhibit different asymptotic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) is concerned with the recovery of structured signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that structured signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases, by recasting PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applying existing solvers such as basis pursuit. Known guarantees are either non-uniform or do not tolerate model error. We show that this linearization approach is more powerful than the prior results indicate. First, it achieves uniform instance optimality: Under complex Gaussian matrix with a near-optimal number of rows, this approach uniformly recovers all signals in $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ with errors proportional to the model errors of the signals. Specifically, for sparse recovery there exists an efficient estimator $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$ and some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le \frac{C\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1}{\sqrt{s}}~(\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$, where $\sigma_s(\mathbf{x})_1=\min_{\mathbf{u}\in\Sigma^n_s}\|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{x}\|_1$ is the model error under $\ell_1$-norm. Second, the instance optimality is robust to small dense disturbances and sparse corruptions that arise before or after capturing the phases. As an extension, we also propose to recast sparsely corrupted PO-CS as a linear corrupted sensing problem and show that this achieves perfect reconstruction of the signals. Our results resemble the instance optimal guarantees in linear compressed sensing and, to our knowledge, are the first results of this kind for a non-linear sensing scenario.</description>

      <title>A characterization for an almost MDS code to be a near MDS code and a proof of the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements, where $q=p^{m}$ with $p$ being a prime number and $m$ being a positive integer. Let $\mathcal{C}_{(q, n, \delta, h)}$ be a class of BCH codes of length $n$ and designed $\delta$. A linear code $\mathcal{C}$ is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if the minimum distance $d=n-k+1$. If $d=n-k$, then $\mathcal{C}$ is called an almost MDS (AMDS) code. Moreover, if both of $\mathcal{C}$ and its dual code $\mathcal{C}^{\bot}$ are AMDS, then $\mathcal{C}$ is called a near MDS (NMDS) code. In [A class of almost MDS codes, {\it Finite Fields Appl.} {\bf 79} (2022), \#101996], Geng, Yang, Zhang and Zhou proved that the BCH code $\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is an almost MDS code, where $q=3^m$ and $m$ is an odd integer, and they also showed that its parameters is $[q+1, q-3, 4]$. Furthermore, they proposed a conjecture stating that the dual code $\mathcal{C}^{\bot}_{(q, q+1, 3, 4)}$ is also an AMDS code with parameters $[q+1, 4, q-3]$. In this paper, we first present a characterization for the dual code of an almost MDS code to be an almost MDS code. Then we use this result to show that the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou conjecture is true. Our result together with the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou theorem implies that the BCH code $\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is a near MDS code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of sixth-generation networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have revolutionized wireless communications through dynamic electromagnetic wave manipulation, thereby facilitating the adaptability and unparalleled control of real-time performance evaluations. This study proposed a framework to analyze the performance of RIS-assisted free-space optics (FSO) communication over doubly inverted Gamma-Gamma (IGGG) distributions with pointing error impairments. Furthermore, a special scenario addressing secure communication in the potential presence of an eavesdropper. Consequently, we derived closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, average channel capacity, average secrecy capacity, and secrecy outage probability by employing an asymptotic analysis to provide deeper insights into the influence of various system parameters. Finally, we verified our analytical results through appropriate numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dual Threats in RIS-Aided RF-UOWC Mixed Networks: Secrecy Performance Analysis under Simultaneous RF and UOWC Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic realm of 6G technology, emphasizing security is essential, particularly for optimizing high-performance communication. A notable strategy involves the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging and cost-efficient technology aimed at fortifying incoming signals, broadening coverage, and ultimately improving the overall performance of systems. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework to analyze the secrecy performance of an RIS-assisted mixed radio frequency (RF) - underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) network. Here, all the RF links undergo alpha-mu fading distribution, whereas the UOWC links experience a mixture of Exponential Generalized Gamma distribution. Specifically, we examine three potential eavesdropping situations: 1) eavesdropping on the RF link, 2) eavesdropping on the UOWC link, and 3) a simultaneous eavesdropping attack affecting both RF and UOWC links. To achieve this, we derive novel mathematical expressions such as average secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, strictly positive secrecy capacity, and effective secrecy throughput in closed form. Using these derived expressions, we carry out an investigation to assess the influences of fading parameters, pointing errors, receiver detection technique, underwater turbulence severity, and water salinity on the system. Furthermore, our study investigates the significance of RIS in improving secrecy performance due to the proposed model. To provide deeper insights, we also perform asymptotic analysis for the high signal-to-noise region. Finally, to verify our analytical results, we conduct Monte Carlo simulation using a computer-based technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the generalized Arimoto-Blahut algorithm to a general function defined over Bregman-divergence system. In existing methods, when linear constraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization. Exploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a convex-optimization-free algorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum rate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of the optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex sequential decision-making planning problems, covering infinite states' space have been shown to be solvable by AlphaZero type of algorithms. Such an approach that trains a neural model while simulating projection of futures with a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm were shown to be applicable to real life planning problems. As such, engineers and users interacting with the resulting policy of behavior might benefit from obtaining automated explanations about these planners' decisions offline or online. This paper focuses on the information within the Monte Carlo Tree Search data structure. Given its construction, this information contains much of the reasoning of the sequential decision-making algorithm and is essential for its explainability. We show novel methods using information theoretic tools for the simplification and reduction of the Monte Carlo Tree Search and the extraction of information. Such information can be directly used for the construction of human understandable explanations. We show that basic explainability quantities can be calculated with limited additional computational cost, as an integrated part of the Monte Carlo Tree Search construction process. We focus on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects and provide examples of how the methods presented here can be used in the construction of human understandable explanations.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for Deep Sparse Coding via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intersection of sparse coding theory and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish a thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend this convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Residual-INR: Communication Efficient On-Device Learning Using Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.</description>

Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>

      <title>On the Exactness of SDP Relaxation for Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and finds numerous applications in operation research, computer vision, and pattern recognition. However, it is a very well-known NP-hard problem to find the global minimizer to the QAP. In this work, we study the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the QAP and investigate when the SDR recovers the global minimizer. In particular, we consider the two input matrices satisfy a simple signal-plus-noise model, and show that when the noise is sufficiently smaller than the signal, then the SDR is exact, i.e., it recovers the global minimizer to the QAP. It is worth noting that this sufficient condition is purely algebraic and does not depend on any statistical assumption of the input data. We apply our bound to several statistical models such as correlated Gaussian Wigner model. Despite the sub-optimality in theory under those models, empirical studies show the remarkable performance of the SDR. Our work could be the first step towards a deeper understanding of the SDR exactness for the QAP.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Spectral Estimator and MLE for Orthogonal Group Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal group synchronization aims to recover orthogonal group elements from their noisy pairwise measurements. It has found numerous applications including computer vision, imaging science, and community detection. Due to the orthogonal constraints, it is often challenging to find the least squares estimator in presence of noise. In the recent years, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and spectral methods have proven to be powerful tools in recovering the group elements. In particular, under additive Gaussian noise, the SDR exactly produces the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and both MLE and spectral methods are able to achieve near-optimal statistical error. In this work, we take one step further to quantify the uncertainty of the MLE and spectral estimators by considering their distributions. By leveraging the orthogonality constraints in the likelihood function, we obtain a second-order expansion of the MLE and spectral estimator with the leading terms as an anti-symmetric Gaussian random matrix that is on the tangent space of the orthogonal matrix. This also implies state-of-the-art min-max risk bounds as a by-product. Our works provide a general theoretical framework that is potentially useful to find an approximate distribution of the estimators arising from many statistical inference problems with manifold constraints. The numerical experiments confirm our theoretical contribution.</description>

      <title>Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888</link>

Abstract: The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length.
  A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</description>

      <title>AG Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity over Constant-sized Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently-emerging field of higher order MDS codes has sought to unify a number of concepts in coding theory. Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem).
  By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column.
  We then generalize the techniques of GZ and AGL to show that both these relaxations can be constructed over constant size fields by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi. We obtain the following corollaries from our main result. First, randomly punctured AG codes of rate $R$ achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$. Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity. Second, by randomly puncturing AG codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.</description>

      <title>Correction to "Private Information Retrieval Over Gaussian MAC"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the above article \cite{shmuel2021private}, the authors introduced a PIR scheme for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Multiple Access Channel (MAC), both with and without fading. The authors utilized the additive nature of the channel and leveraged the linear properties and structure of lattice codes to retrieve the desired message without the servers acquiring any knowledge about the retrieved message's index.
  Theorems 3 and 4 in \cite{shmuel2021private} contain an error arising from the incorrect usage of the modulo operator. Moreover, the proofs assume a one-to-one mapping function, $\phi(\cdot)$, between a message $W_j\in\mathbb{F}_p^L$ and the elements of $\cC$, mistakenly suggesting that the user possesses all the required information in advance. % \st{However, this is not the case.} \textcolor{black}{To deal with that, we defined $\phi(\cdot)$ as a one-to-one mapping function between a vector of $l$ information bits and a lattice point $\lambda\in\cC$}. Herein, we present the corrected versions of these theorems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore constructions for codes that correct two bursts of deletions, with each burst having length exactly $b$. Previously, the best known construction, derived using the syndrome compression technique, achieved a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$ bits. In this work, we present new constructions for all $q\ge 2$ that achieve redundancy at most $7\log n+O(\log\log n)$ when $b&gt;1$. Additionally, for $b=1$, we provide a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with redundancy $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ for all $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Near-Field XL-MIMO Transceiver Design: Principles and Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been a critical enabling technology in 5th generation (5G) wireless networks. With the advent of 6G, a natural evolution is to employ even more antennas, potentially an order of magnitude more, to meet the ever-increasing demand for spectral efficiency. This is beyond a mere quantitative scale-up. The enlarged array aperture brings a paradigm shift towards near-field communications, departing from traditional far-field approaches. However, designing advanced transceiver algorithms for near-field systems is extremely challenging because of the enormous system scale, the complicated channel characteristics, and the uncertainties in the propagation environments. Hence, it is important to develop scalable, low-complexity, and robust algorithms that can efficiently characterize and leverage the properties of the near-field channel. In this article, we discuss the principles and advocate two general frameworks to design deep learning-based near-field transceivers covering both iterative and non-iterative algorithms. Case studies on channel estimation and beam focusing are presented to provide a hands-on tutorial. Finally, we discuss open issues and shed light on future directions.</description>

      <title>Index Modulation for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A joint design of both sensing and communication can lead to substantial enhancement for both subsystems in terms of size, cost as well as spectrum and hardware efficiency. In the last decade, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize the spectrum on a single and shared hardware platform. Recent studies focused on developing multi-function approaches to share the spectrum between radar sensing and communications. Index modulation (IM) is one particular approach to incorporate information-bearing communication symbols into the emitted radar waveforms. While IM has been well investigated in communications-only systems, the implementation adoption of IM concept in ISAC has recently attracted researchers to achieve improved energy/spectral efficiency while maintaining satisfactory radar sensing performance. This article focuses on recent studies on IM-ISAC, and presents in detail the analytical background and relevance of the major IM-ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>New scattered linearized quadrinomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;t&lt;n$ be integers, where $t$ is a divisor of $n$. An R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomial is a $\mathbb F_q$-linearized polynomial $f$ in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ that satisfies the condition that for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ such that $x/y\in\mathbb F_{q^t}$, if $f(x)/x=f(y)/y$, then $x/y\in\mathbb F_q$; $f$ is called scattered if this implication holds for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$. Two polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are said to be equivalent if their graphs are in the same orbit under the action of the group $\Gamma L(2,q^n)$. For $n&gt;8$ only three families of scattered polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are known: $(i)$~monomials of pseudoregulus type, $(ii)$~binomials of Lunardon-Polverino type, and $(iii)$~a family of quadrinomials defined in [1,10] and extended in [8,13]. In this paper we prove that the polynomial $\varphi_{m,q^J}=X^{q^{J(t-1)}}+X^{q^{J(2t-1)}}+m(X^{q^J}-X^{q^{J(t+1)}})\in\mathbb F_{q^{2t}}[X]$, $q$ odd, $t\ge3$ is R-$q^t$-partially scattered for every value of $m\in\mathbb F_{q^t}^*$ and $J$ coprime with $2t$. Moreover, for every $t&gt;4$ and $q&gt;5$ there exist values of $m$ for which $\varphi_{m,q}$ is scattered and new with respect to the polynomials mentioned in $(i)$, $(ii)$ and $(iii)$ above. The related linear sets are of $\Gamma L$-class at least two.</description>
