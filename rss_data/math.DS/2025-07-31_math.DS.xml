      <title>On $C^r$-generic twist maps of ${\rm T^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider twist diffeomorphisms of the torus, $f:{\rm T^2\rightarrow T^2,}$ and their vertical rotation intervals $\rho _V(\widehat{f})=[\rho _V^{-},\rho _V^{+}],$ where $\widehat{f}$ is a lift of $f$ to the vertical annulus or cylinder. We show that $C^r$-generically for any $r\geq 1$, both extremes of the rotation interval are rational and locally constant under $C^0$-perturbations of the map. Moreover, when $f$ is area-preserving, $C^r$-generically $\rho _V^{-}&lt;\rho _V^{+}.$
  Also, for any twist map $f$, $\widehat{f}$ a lift of $f$ to the cylinder, if $\rho _V^{-}&lt;\rho _V^{+}=p/q$, then there are two possibilities: either $\widehat{f}^q(\bullet)-(0,p)$ maps a simple essential loop into the connected component of its complement which is below the loop, or it satisfies the Curve Intersection Property. In the first case, $\rho _V^{+} \leq p/q$ in a $C^0$-neighborhood of $f,$ and in the second case, we show that $\rho _V^{+}(\widehat{f}+(0,t))&gt;p/q$ for all $t&gt;0$ (that is, the rotation interval is ready to grow). Finally, in the $C^r$-generic case, assuming that $\rho _V^{-}&lt;\rho _V^{+}=p/q,$ we present some consequences of the existence of the free loop for $\widehat{f}^q(\bullet)-(0,p)$, related to the description and shape of the attractor-reppeler pair that exists in the annulus. The case of a $C^r$-generic transitive twist diffeomorphism (if such a thing exists) is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Computing Periodic Billiard Orbits in $L^p$ Balls via Newton's Method and Smale's $\alpha$-Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method for finding and verifying periodic billiard orbits in $L^{p}$ balls ($p&gt;2$) using Newton's method applied to a variational formulation. The orbits are verified with Smale's alpha-criterion, which provides a rigorous certificate of existence. We implement efficient batched computations in JAX and present systematic results for various $p$ and bounce counts $N$. Our experiments reveal striking patterns in the critical-point structure, including a predominance of specific Morse signatures and rotation numbers that depend on the parity and primality of $N$. Notably, our method routinely finds many more than the two periodic orbits per rotation number guaranteed by Birkhoff's theorem -- a large-scale run with five bounces in the $L^{3}$ ball produced 8,927 distinct certified orbits from 30,000 random seeds, uncovering power-law growth and intricate clustering visualised with UMAP.</description>

      <title>Arnold diffusion in the elliptic Hill four-body problem: geometric method and numerical verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism for Arnold diffusion in energy in a model of the elliptic Hill four-body problem. Our model is expressed as a small perturbation of the circular Hill four-body problem, with the small parameter being the eccentricity of the orbits of the primaries. The mechanism relies on the existence of two normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs), and on the corresponding homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. The dynamics along homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits is encoded via scattering maps, which we compute numerically. We provide two arguments for diffusion. In the first argument, we successively apply a single scattering map and use Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem to obtain pseudo-orbits that, on average, gain energy. In the second argument, we use two scattering maps and, at each step, select one that increases energy. Either argument yields pseudo-orbits of scattering maps along which the energy grows by an amount independent of the small parameter. A shadowing lemma concludes the existence of diffusing orbits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local behaviour of solutions near the fixed points of a reaction-diffusion equation with discontinuous nonlinearity. By employing an appropriate linearization around the fixed points, which involves the Dirac delta distribution, we analyze the stability of the stationary solutions and demonstrate that they exhibit a saddle-point structure. As a result, we establish the hyperbolicity of the fixed points.</description>

      <title>First integrals and invariants of systems of ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between monomial first integrals, polynomial invariants of certain group action, and the Poincar\'{e}-Dulac normal forms for autonomous systems of ODEs with diagonal matrix of the linear part. Using tools from computational algebra, we develop an algorithmic approach for identifying generators of the algebras of monomial and polynomial first integrals, which works in the general case where the matrix of the linear part includes algebraic complex eigenvalues. Our method also provides a practical tool for exploring the algebraic structure of polynomial invariants and their relation to the Poincar\'{e}-Dulac normal forms of the underlying vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of Halley's and Traub's root-finding algorithms applied to a symmetric family of polynomials of degree $d+1\geq 3$. We discuss the (un)boundedness and simple connectivity of the immediate basins of attraction of the fixed points associated to the roots of the polynomials. In particular, we show the existence of polynomials for which the immediate basin of attraction of a root is bounded under Halley's method</description>

      <title>Synchronization of mean-field models on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global synchronization does not occur when $\beta &lt; -2/3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new control algorithm for unstable linear systems with input delay. In comparison with known analogues, the control law has been designed, which is a modification of the Smith predictor, and is the simplest one to implement without requiring complex integration methods. At the same time, the problem of stabilization of a closed system is effectively solved, ensuring the boundedness of all state variables and the exponential stability of the equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Boosting Ensembles for Statistics of Tails at Conditionally Optimal Advance Split Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate science needs more efficient ways to study high-impact, low-probability extreme events, which are rare by definition and costly to simulate in large numbers. Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting offer a novel strategy to extract more information from those occasional simulated events: small perturbations in advance can turn a moderate event into a severe one, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years. But how to choose this ``advance split time'' (AST) remains a challenge for sudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a concrete optimization problem for the AST and instantiate it on an idealized but physically informative model system: a quasigeostrophic turbulent channel flow advecting a passive tracer, which captures key elements of midlatitude storm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can RES methods, in particular \emph{ensemble boosting} and \emph{trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting}, accurately sample extreme events of return periods longer than the simulation time? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how does it depend on the definition of the extreme event, in particular the target location? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?
  Our answers are tentatively positive. (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail estimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales, which varies weakly but detectably with target location. (3) A certain functional that we call the \emph{thresholded entropy} successfully picks out near-optimal ASTs, eliminating the need for arbitrary thresholds that have thus far hindered RES methods. Our work clarifies aspects of the optimization landscape and can, in our view, guide future research efforts on optimizing and sampling transient extreme events more efficiently in general chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Rational Integrator for the Replicator Dynamics on the Probability Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quadratically convergent and dynamically consistent integrator specifically designed for the replicator dynamics. The proposed scheme combines a two-stage rational approximation with a normalization step to ensure confinement to the probability simplex and unconditional preservation of non-negativity, invariant sets and equilibria. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to establish the scheme's second-order accuracy, and an embedded auxiliary method is devised for adaptive time-stepping based on local error estimation. Furthermore, a discrete analogue of the quotient rule, which governs the evolution of component ratios, is shown to hold. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, illustrating the method's ability to reproduce complex dynamics and to outperform well-established solvers in particularly challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated on two systems that serve as well-known models exhibiting chaotic itinerancy: globally coupled logistic maps (GCM) and mutually coupled Gaussian maps. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as the coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <title>Quasiconformal characterization of Schottky sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complement of the union of a collection of disjoint open disks in the $2$-sphere is called a Schottky set. We prove that a subset $S$ of the $2$-sphere is quasiconformally equivalent to a Schottky set if and only if every pair of complementary components of $S$ can be mapped to a pair of open disks with a uniformly quasiconformal homeomorphism of the sphere. Our theorem applies to Sierpi\'nski carpets and gaskets, yielding for the first time a general quasiconformal uniformization result for gaskets. Moreover, it contains Bonk's uniformization result for carpets as a special case and does not rely on the condition of uniform relative separation that is used in relevant works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep diagonal map $T_k$ acts on planar polygons by connecting the $k$-th diagonals and intersecting them successively. The map $T_2$ is the pentagram map, and $T_k$ is a generalization. We study the action of $T_k$ on two subsets of the so-called twisted polygons, which we term type-$\alpha$ and type-$\beta$ $k$-spirals. For $k \geq 2$, $T_{k}$ preserves both types of $k$-spirals. In particular, we show that for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, both types of $k$-spirals have precompact forward and backward $T_k$-orbits modulo projective transformations. We derive a rational formula for $T_3$, which generalizes the $y$-variables transformation formula of the corresponding quiver mutation by M. Glick and P. Pylyavskyy. We also present four algebraic invariants of $T_3$. These special orbits in the moduli space are partitioned into cells of a $3 \times 3$ tic-tac-toe grid. This establishes the action of $T_k$ on $k$-spirals as a geometric generalization of $T_2$ on convex polygons.</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem, Auto-Correlation and Sequences with an Empty Fourier-Bohr Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation. As for pointwise convergence, this was already observed in [5], and here we exploit the opportunity to write down the proof. This yields a more intrinsic characterization of the sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem. Then we proceed and obtain a characterization linked to auto-correlation also to sequences satisfying the mean theorem - by that theorem those were already known to be exactly the sequences with an empty Fourier-Bohr spectrum. Some further investigation is done and examples are provided regarding generic sequences for which the measure on the circle that the auto-correlation function represents (by Fourier transform) is not atomless.</description>

      <title>Computing a Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>Resolving the joint ergodicity problem for Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The joint ergodicity classification problem aims to characterize those sequences which are jointly ergodic along an arbitrary dynamical system if and only if they satisfy two natural, simpler-to-verify conditions on this system. These two conditions, dubbed the difference and product ergodicity conditions, naturally arise from Berend and Bergelson's pioneering work on joint ergodicity. Elaborating on our earlier work, we investigate this problem for Hardy sequences of polynomial growth, this time without making any independence assumptions on the sequences. Our main result establishes the "difficult" direction of the problem: if a Hardy family satisfies the difference and product ergodicity conditions on a given system, then it is jointly ergodic for this system. We also find that, surprisingly, the converse fails for certain pathological families of Hardy sequences, even though it holds for all "reasonable" Hardy families. We conclude by suggesting potential fixes to the statement of this problem. New ideas of independent interest developed in this paper include the structure theory of a family of factors generalizing Host-Kra and box factors; a strengthening of Tao-Ziegler's concatenation results; and the most robust extension of a seminorm smoothing argument.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \] where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi}, $ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1), $ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate almost surely.</description>

      <title>On linearly ordered sets of chain components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the chain components arising from a dynamical system $(X,f)$, with $X$ a compact metric space, from the point of view of poset theory, considering both the case in which $f$ is a continuous map and the general case in which no regularity assumption is made.
  Our main result are that, if $f$ is continuous, we have that:
  - the chain components poset cannot be linearly and densely ordered;
  - every countable well-order with a maximum is the order type of the chain components poset of an interval map.
  If no regularity assumption is made, we have that:
  - there is a dynamical system on the interval whose chain components poset is countable and densely ordered;
  - any countable linearly ordered subset of the chain components poset must have a minimum element.</description>

      <title>Dynamic flux surrogate-based partitioned methods for interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loosely coupled partitioned methods for multiphysics problems treat each subproblem as a separate entity and advance them independently in time. In so doing these methods enable code reuse, increase concurrency and provide a convenient framework for plug-and-play multiphysics simulations. However, mathematically loosely coupled schemes are equivalent to a single step of an iterative solution method, which can compromise their accuracy and stability. We present a new data-driven partitioned method for coupled parametric PDEs that can improve upon the accuracy of traditional loosely coupled methods without incurring a performance penalty. To that end, we replace conventional field transfers across the interface by a surrogate for the dynamics of the interface flux exchanged between the subdomains. To develop this surrogate we apply dynamic mode decomposition to a non-standard staggered-in-time state, comprising the interface flux and small solution patches near the interface. The new approach shifts the main computational burden to an offline training phase, whereas application of the surrogate in the online phase amounts to a single matrix-vector multiplication. We provide stability analysis of the surrogate-based partitioned scheme and include numerical results that demonstrate its potential.</description>

      <title>A hybrid framework for compartmental models enabling simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-scale systems often exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic dynamics. In compartmental models, low occupancy compartments tend to exhibit stochastic dynamics while high occupancy compartments tend to follow deterministic dynamics. Representing both dynamics with existing methods is challenging. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce ``atto-foxes'', for example in the Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This limitation becomes problematic when studying the extinction of species or the clearance of infection, but it can be overcome by using discrete stochastic models, such as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is impractical for many realistic models, where discrete events have very high frequencies.
  In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework to couple continuous ODEs and discrete CTMCs: ``Jump-Switch-Flow'' (JSF). In this framework, compartments can reach extinct states (``absorbing states''), thereby resolving atto-fox-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially computationally faster than existing alternatives, by at least one order of magnitude, and can even obtain constant scaling, irrespective of compartment occupancy.
  We demonstrate JSF's utility for simulation-based inference, particularly multi-scale problems, with several case-studies. In a simulation study, we demonstrate how JSF can enable a more nuanced analysis of the efficacy of public health interventions. We also carry out a novel analysis of longitudinal within-host data from SARS-CoV-2 infections to quantify the timing of viral clearance. In this work, we show how JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model simulation.</description>

      <title>A Weighted-Median Model of Opinion Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions result in a consensus opinion; in others, they result in opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of "echo chambers". Consider a social network of individuals, who hold continuous-valued scalar opinions and change their opinions when they interact with each other. In such an opinion model, it is common for an opinion-update rule to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. However, we consider an alternative update rule - which may be more realistic in some situations - that instead depends on a weighted median opinion of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our opinion model, we investigate how the limit opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals in a network.</description>

      <title>Non-geometric property (T) of warped cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action on a compact Lie group $M$ by its finitely generated subgroup. We show that if a subgroup $G$ is dense in $M$, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$. This result applies to certain ergodic actions of groups with property (T), for example, the action of $SO(d,\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{5}])$ on $SO(d)$ with $d\geq 5$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T), including certain superexpanders.</description>

      <title>Boundary stratifications of Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hurwitz space that parametrises holomorphic maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$. Abramovich, Corti and Vistoli, building on work of Harris and Mumford, describe a compactification $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ with a natural boundary stratification. We show that the irreducible strata of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$ are in bijection with combinatorial objects called decorated trees (up to a suitable equivalence), and that containment of irreducible strata is given by edge contraction of decorated trees. This combinatorial description allows us to define a tropical Hurwitz space, which we identify with the skeleton of the Berkovich analytification of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$. The tropical Hurwitz space that we obtain is a refinement of a version defined by Cavalieri, Markwig and Ranganathan. We also provide an implementation that computes the stratification of $\overline{\mathcal{H}}$, and discuss applications to complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exponentially mixing flows with slow enhanced dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a passive scalar which is advected by an incompressible flow $u$ and has small molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>
