      <title>Climatic Phase Transitions Unravel the Onset and Withdrawal of Indian Monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The livelihood and food security of more than a billion people depend on the Indian monsoon (IM). Yet, a universal definition of the large-scale season and progress of IM is missing. Even though IM is a planetary-scale convectively coupled system arising largely from seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the definitions of its onset and progression are based on local weather observations, making them practically inutile due to the detection of bogus onsets. Using climate networks, we show that small-scale clusters of locally defined rainfall onsets coalesce through two abrupt climatic phase transitions defining large-scale monsoon onsets over Northeast India and the Indian peninsula, respectively. These abrupt transitions are interspersed with continuous growth of clusters. Breaking the conventional wisdom that IM starts from southern peninsula and expands northward and westward, we unveil that IM starts from Northeast India and expands westward and northward, covering the entire country. We show that the large-scale monsoon onset over the Indian peninsula is critically dependent on the characteristics of monsoon onset over Northeast India. Unlike existing definitions, a rapid and consistent northward propagation of rainfall establishing the ITCZ manifests after our network-based onset dates. Thus, our definition captures the IM onset better than the existing definitions.</description>

      <title>Supercell environments using GridRad-Severe and the HRRR: Addressing discrepancies between prior tornado datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storm-relative helicity (SRH) is an important ingredient in supercell development, as well as mesocyclone intensity, and is linked to tornadogenesis and tornado potential. Derived from the storm-relative wind profile, SRH is composed of both the vertical wind shear and storm-relative flow. Recent studies have come to conflicting findings regarding whether shallower or deeper layers of SRH have more skill in tornado forecasting. Possible causes of this discrepancy include the use of observed versus model-based proximity soundings, as well as whether the storm-relative wind profile is determined via observed versus estimated storm motions. This study uses a new dataset of objectively identified supercells, with observed storm motions, paired with high-resolution model analyses to address the discrepancies among prior studies. Unlike in previous model-based tornado environmental datasets, the present approach reveals substantive differences in storm-relative flow, vertical wind shear, and SRH within the low-to-mid-levels between nontornadic and tornadic supercells. Using observed storm motions for storm-relative variables further magnifies differences in the low-to-mid-level storm-relative winds between nontornadic and tornadic supercells, ultimately leading to deeper layers of SRH having more forecast skill than near-ground SRH. Thus, the combination of a higher-resolution model analyses, which better represents the near-storm environment, with observed storm motions appears to explain why many past tornado climatologies using model-based environmental analyses have failed to find significant differences in the storm-relative wind profile. These results help bridge the gap between previous studies that employed coarser model-based analyses with those that aggregated observed soundings from field projects.</description>

      <title>Revealing the drivers of turbulence anisotropy over flat and complex terrain: an interpretable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence anisotropy was recently integrated into Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), extending its applicability to complex terrain and diverse surface conditions. Implementing this generalized MOST in numerical models, however, requires understanding the key drivers of turbulence anisotropy across various terrain conditions. This study therefore employs random forest models trained on measurement data from both flat and complex terrain and including upstream terrain features, to predict turbulence anisotropy. Two approaches were compared: using dimensional variables directly or employing non-dimensional groups as model input. To address cross-correlation among features, we developed a new selection method, Recursive Effect Elimination. Finally, interpretability methods were used to identify the most influential variables. Contrary to expectations, variables related to terrain influence were not found to significantly impact turbulence anisotropy. Instead, non-dimensional groups of common turbulence length, time and velocity scales proved more robust than dimensional variables in isolating anisotropy drivers, enhancing model performance over complex terrain and reducing location dependence. A ratio of integral and turbulence memory length scales was found to correlate well with turbulence anisotropy in both daytime and nighttime conditions, both over flat and complex terrain. During the day, a refined stability parameter incorporating both the surface and mixed layer scaling emerged as the dominant driver of anisotropy, while at night, parameters related to rapid distortion were strong predictors.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation and shear-induced dynamics of spheroids in fluids with spatial viscosity variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized reciprocal theorem is used to relate the force and torque induced on a particle in an inertia-less fluid with small variation in viscosity to integrals involving Stokes flow fields and the spatial dependence of viscosity. These resistivity expressions are analytically evaluated using spheroidal harmonics and then used to obtain the mobility of the spheroid during sedimentation, and in linear flows, of a fluid with linear viscosity stratification. The coupling between the rotational and translational motion induced by stratification rotates the spheroid's centerline, creating a variety of rotational and translational dynamics dependent upon the particle's aspect ratio, $\kappa$, and the component of the stratification unit vector in the gravity direction, $d_g$. Spheroids with $0.55\lessapprox\kappa\lessapprox2.0$ exhibit the largest variety of settling behaviors. Interestingly, this range covers most microplastics and typical microorganisms. One of the modes include a stable orientation dependent only on $\kappa$ and $d_g$, but independent of initial orientation, thus allowing for the potential control of settling angles and sedimentation rates. In a simple shear flow, cross-streamline migration occurs due to the stratification-induced force generated on the particle. Similarly, a particle no longer stays at the stagnation point of a uniaxial extensional flow. While fully analytical results are obtained for spheroids, numerical simulations provide a source of validation. These simulations also provide additional insights into the stratification-induced force- and torque-producing mechanisms through the stratification-induced stress, which is not accessed in the reciprocal theorem-based analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Deep Mantle-Atmosphere Coupling and Carbonaceous Bombardment: Options for Biomolecule Formation on an Oxidized Early Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding what environmental conditions prevailed on early Earth during the Hadean eon, and how this set the stage for the origins of life, remains a challenge. Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by chondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping an atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical synthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can rain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic molecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could condense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the ingredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources of reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic molecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model. We find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment can produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\sim 1-10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially oxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\,\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce the atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations are sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies. RNA could have appeared on Earth immediately after it became habitable (about $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Moon-forming impact), or it could have (re)appeared later at any time up to the beginning of the Archean.</description>

      <title>Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.
