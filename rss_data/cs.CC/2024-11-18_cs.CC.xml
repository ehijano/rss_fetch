      <title>Bounded degree QBF and positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10093v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of SAT and its variants has provided numerous NP-complete problems, from which most NP-hardness results were derived. Due to the NP-hardness of SAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or to obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of several problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also NP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions even with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a function of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for QBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of a maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However, surprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided in polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct consequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter positional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree hypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Monotone Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study functions $f : [0, 1]^d \rightarrow [0, 1]^d$ that are both monotone and contracting, and we consider the problem of finding an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of $f$. We show that the problem lies in the complexity class UEOPL. We give an algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of a three-dimensional monotone contraction using $O(\log (1/\varepsilon))$ queries to $f$. We also give a decomposition theorem that allows us to use this result to obtain an algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate fixed point of a $d$-dimensional monotone contraction using $O((c \cdot \log (1/\varepsilon))^{\lceil d / 3 \rceil})$ queries to $f$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, each step of both of our algorithms takes time that is polynomial in the representation of $f$. These results are strictly better than the best-known results for functions that are only monotone, or only contracting.
  All of our results also apply to Shapley stochastic games, which are known to be reducible to the monotone contraction problem. Thus we put Shapley games in UEOPL, and we give a faster algorithm for approximating the value of a Shapley game.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Maker-Breaker Games on Edge Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic complexity of Maker-Breaker games played on the edge sets of general graphs. We mainly consider the perfect matching game and the $H$-game. Maker wins if she claims the edges of a perfect matching in the first, and a copy of a fixed graph $H$ in the second. We prove that deciding who wins the perfect matching game and the $H$-game is PSPACE-complete, even for the latter in small-diameter graphs if $H$ is a tree. Toward finding the smallest graph $H$ for which the $H$-game is PSPACE-complete, we also prove that such an $H$ of order 51 and size 57 exists.
  We then give several positive results for the $H$-game. As the $H$-game is already PSPACE-complete when $H$ is a tree, we mainly consider the case where $H$ belongs to a subclass of trees. In particular, we design two linear-time algorithms, both based on structural characterizations, to decide the winners of the $P_4$-game in general graphs and the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in trees. Then, we prove that the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in any graph, and the $H$-game in trees are both FPT parameterized by the length of the game, notably adding to the short list of games with this property, which is of independent interest.
  Another natural direction to take is to consider the $H$-game when $H$ is a cycle. While we were unable to resolve this case, we prove that the related arboricity-$k$ game is polynomial-time solvable. In particular, when $k=2$, Maker wins this game if she claims the edges of any cycle.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of a graph $G$ is the least number $k$ such that the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm distinguishes $G$ from every other non-isomorphic graph. The dimension is a standard measure of the descriptive complexity of a graph and recently finds various applications in particular in the context of machine learning. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of computing the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. We observe that in general the problem of deciding whether the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of $G$ is at most $k$ is NP-hard. This is also true for the more restricted problem with graphs of color multiplicity at most 4. Therefore, we study parameterized versions of the problem. We give, for each fixed $k\geq 2$, a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of a given graph of color multiplicity at most $5$ is at most $k$. Moreover, we show that for these color multiplicities this is optimal in the sense that this problem is P-hard under logspace-uniform $\text{AC}_0$-reductions. Furthermore, for each larger bound $c$ on the color classes and each fixed $k\geq 2$, we provide a polynomial-time decision algorithm for the abelian case, that is, for structures of which each color class has an abelian automorphism group.
  While the graph classes we consider may seem quite restrictive, graphs with $4$-bounded abelian colors include CFI-graphs and multipedes, which form the basis of almost all known hard instances and lower bounds related to the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>
