      <title>On the family discrimination in 331-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the so-called 331-models the gauge anomalies cancel only if there are three generations of fermions. This requires one of the quark generations to be in a different representation than the other two. But which generation is treated differently? In this work we study how the choice of differently treated generation effects the quark flavour structure and how the discriminated generation can be deduced from experiments. We study a general model based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, which contains exotic quarks with same electric charges as SM quarks. We take fully into account the effects from exotic quark mixing with the SM quarks, which is often omitted in literature. We will also pay particular attention to $125$ GeV Higgs, and show analytically why its flavour violating couplings between SM quarks are suppressed.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement from experimental data: $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an angular analysis based on the reconstruction of the helicity amplitudes from dedicated experimental data corresponding to the tripartite state composed by one qutrit and two qubits, which arises in the three-body decays of a spin zero particle into one vector and a fermion pair. Starting from the associated spin density matrix of the final state, entanglement quantifiers were investigated and the corresponding significances were determined up to second order in the error propagation of the uncertainties of the angular measurements. As an application of our analysis, we performed a full quantum tomography of the final state in the $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays using data recorded by LHCb collaboration. We found the presence of genuine quantum entanglement of the final state and also in both kaon-muon and di-muon subsystems. In recent years, $B$ meson decays received significant attention from both experimental and theoretical sides, and the proposed observables provide novel perspectives for studying them. Furthermore, this analysis could be also applied to other several processes if the complete experimental data were available for the helicity amplitudes reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Radio Lines from accreting Axion Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles, which we call axions, can compose the missing dark matter and may form substructures such as miniclusters and axion stars. We obtain the mass distributions of axion stars derived from their host miniclusters in our galaxy and find a significant number of axion stars reaching the decay mass, the critical mass set by the axion-photon coupling. Axion stars that have reached the decay mass can accrete surrounding axions either via or directly from their host miniclusters, subsequently converting them into radio photons through parametric resonance. We demonstrate that this accretion provides observable signals by proposing two scenarios: 1) external accretion of background dark matter occurring via miniclusters, and 2) internal accretion of isolated systems occurring directly from the minicluster onto its core. The emitted radio photons are nearly monochromatic with energies around the half of the axion mass. The radio-line signal emanating from such axion stars provides a distinctive opportunity searching for axions, overcoming the widespread radio backgrounds. We estimate the expected radio-line flux density to constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ at each axion mass and find that the resultant line flux density is strong enough to be observed in radio telescopes such as LOFAR, FAST, ALMA, and upcoming SKA. We can constrain the axion-photon coupling down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \simeq 10^{-12} - 10^{-11}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, reaching even $10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ depending on the accretion models of axion stars, over an axion mass range of $m_a\simeq 10^{-7} - 10^{-2}\,{\rm eV}$. From a different perspective, this radio-line signal could be a strong hint of an axion at the corresponding mass and also of axion stars within our galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Field Guide to Event-Shape Observables Using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay out the phenomenological behavior of event-shape observables evaluated by solving optimal transport problems between collider events and reference geometries -- which we name 'manifold distances' -- to provide guidance regarding their use in future studies. This discussion considers several choices related to the metric used to quantify these distances. We explore the differences between the various options, using a combination of analytical studies and simulated minimum-bias and multi-jet events. Making judicious choices when defining the metric and reference geometry can improve sensitivity to interesting signal features and reduce sensitivity to non-perturbative effects in QCD. The goal of this article is to provide a 'field guide' that can inform how choices made when defining a manifold distance can be tailored for the analysis at-hand.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $M1$ radiative transitions of excited $B_c$ and heavy quarkonia with different polarizations in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the properties of pseudoscalar and vector charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons using the light-front quark model, focusing on the $M1$ radiative transition. For that purpose, we conduct a variational analysis with a QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian, employing a trial wave function expanded in the harmonic oscillator basis functions up to the $3S$ state. We fit the model parameters to mass spectra and decay constants, obtaining reasonable agreement with experimental data and correctly reflecting the hierarchy of mass spectra and decay constants. In analyzing the $M1$ radiative transition, we consider both good ($\mu=+$) and transverse ($\mu={\perp}$) current components with both longitudinal $(h=0)$ and transverse $(h=\pm1)$ polarizations, demonstrating that the results from both components of currents and polarizations are identical. Self-consistency is achieved by substituting $M$ with $M_0$ when computing the operators for decay constants and radiative transitions. We also find that the difference between longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the observables may quantify the anisotropy of the model wave function. Our results on radiative transitions align reasonably well with experimental data, lattice QCD, and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we also provide predictions for $B_c$ mesons that can be tested in experiments.</description>

      <title>A model-independent analysis of the isospin breaking in the $X(3872)~\to~J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ and $X(3872)~\to~J/\psi \pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the latest LHCb data on the $\pi^+\pi^-$ spectrum in the isospin-violating $X(3872)~\to~J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ decay, employing a model-independent approach based on dispersion theory to deal with the $\pi\pi$ final state interactions. Additionally, the isospin breaking effects are properly introduced, allowing for reliable and accurate extraction of the ratio, $R_X$, between the $X(3872)$ couplings to the $J/\psi \rho$ and $J/\psi \omega$ channels from the data. We find very good agreement with the LHCb data for the whole range of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass, and $R_X$ is determined to be $0.19\pm 0.02$, significantly smaller than what was determined earlier. Using this value, we make predictions for the $\pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ mass distribution in the $X(3872)~\to~J/\psi \pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ process, which is currently accessible by the BESIII Collaboration, and update a prediction for the pole positions of the isovector partner states of the $X(3872)$, $W_{c1}$, with $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{++})$.</description>

      <title>Maximal flavor violating $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model with singly-charged scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ $Z'$ model has emerged as a promising candidate to address the longstanding muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly. Flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions are subject to stringent constraints from the neutrino trident process and NA64$\mu$ experiments, which limit the $Z'$ mass to $m_{Z'}&lt;40$ MeV. To circumvent these constraints, flavor-conserving $Z'$ interactions can be converted into maximal flavor-violating interactions through a discrete exchange symmetry. Maximal flavor-violating $Z'$ interactions contribute to $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ via the neutral current, yet the parameter space for this process conflicts with the $(g-2)_\mu$ allowed regions. To resolve this conflict, we propose introducing a singly-charged scalar that mediates via charged current interactions. This scalar is anticipated to produce a negative contribution to the lepton $(g-2)_l$ while concurrently inducing the tau decay $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$. Three distinct scenarios arise from the introduction of singly-charged scalars: the $\mathcal{O}_{LL}$ operator, driven by weak singlet and triplet, and the $\mathcal{O}_{LR}$ operator, driven by weak doublet. Our analysis of the phenomenology in these three cases reveals that the tension between the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly and $\tau\to\mu\nu\bar\nu$ for large $Z'$ masses can be effectively alleviated only by the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet, whereas the singlet and doublet scenarios fall short. Furthermore, the singly-charged scalars from the weak triplet offer an additional explanation for the electron $(g-2)_e$ anomaly. Our findings indicate that weak triplets could play a crucial role in $Z'$ models, potentially providing valuable insights for future research into $U(1)$ frameworks.</description>

      <title>Can charm fluctuation be a better probe to study QCD critical point?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffusion properties of an interacting hadron gas and evaluate the diffusion coefficient matrix for the baryon, strange, electric, and charm quantum numbers. For the first time, this study sheds light on the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for the charmed states by treating them as a part of the quasi-thermalized medium. We explore the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy. A van der Waals-like interaction is assumed between the hadrons, including attractive and repulsive interactions. The calculation of diffusion coefficients is based on relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation. A good agreement with available model calculations is observed in the hadronic limit. To conclude the study, we discuss, with a detailed explanation, that charm fluctuation is expected to be a better tool for probing the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>NNLO beam functions for angularity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popular class of angularity event shapes provides a wealth of information on the hadronic final-state distribution in collider events. While initially proposed for $e^+ e^-$ collisions, angularities have more recently attracted considerable interest as a jet substructure observable at hadron colliders. Moreover, angularities can be measured as a global event shape in deep inelastic electron-nucleon scattering (DIS), and the respective factorisation theorem contains a beam function that parametrises the collinear initial-state radiation. In the present work, we compute the quark and gluon beam functions for seven different angularities to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong-coupling expansion. Our calculation is based on an automated framework that was previously developed for SCET-2 observables, and which we transfer in the current work to the generic SCET-1 case. Our results are relevant for resumming DIS angularity distributions at NNLL$'$ accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bounds on heavy neutral leptons from tree level unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can explain the origin of neutrino masses and oscillations over a wide range of masses. Direct experimental probes of HNLs become unfeasible for masses significantly above the electroweak scale. Consequently, the strongest limits arise from the non-observation of charged lepton flavor-violating processes induced by HNLs at loop level. Counter intuitively, these bounds tighten as the HNL mass increases, an effect that persists within the perturbative regime.
  This work explores the precise form of these bounds for HNLs with masses well beyond the electroweak scale by analyzing the full matrix of partial waves (tree-level unitarity). At high energies, the HNL model simplifies to a Yukawa theory, allowing unitarity constraints to be expressed in terms of the total Yukawa coupling $|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}|^2$ involving HNLs, lepton doublets, and the Higgs boson. Processes with $J=0$ and $J=1/2$ yield the well-known bound $|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}|^2 \leq 8\pi$. However, the most stringent constraint arises from the eigenvalues of the $(\mathcal{N}^2 + 20) \times (\mathcal{N}^2 + 20)$ matrix, which describes the $J=1$ partial wave amplitude for $\mathcal{N}$ generations of HNLs. This bound is given by $|Y_{\mathrm{tot}}|^2 \leq 8\pi/\varphi \approx 15.533$, where $\varphi$ is the Golden ratio. Finally, we determine the maximum mass that an HNL can have in the type-I seesaw model while remaining the sole source of neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Assessing Uncertainties in Parton Showers at Double Logarithmic Accuracy for Jet Quenching Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper assesses the uncertainties inherent to parton shower simulations at double logarithmic accuracy, with a focus on their impact on jet quenching studies in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. For that purpose, we developed a massless quark-initiated vacuum parton shower toy-model with different evolution variables, such as inverse formation time, invariant squared mass, and squared opening angle. In addition to the effects of varying the ordering variable we further examine their corresponding kinematic reconstructions. The results highlight how these variations influence key distributions, including the number of splittings, angular and transverse momentum distribution of subsequent emissions. We also analyse the Lund distributions and their average trajectories, revealing that the choice of ordering variable has a significantly greater impact on the vacuum parton shower evolution than the kinematic scheme, particularly in large-angle emission regions. When a simple jet quenching model based on decoherence is implemented, we observe that the fraction of quenched events is sensitive to the ordering prescription, especially for the first splitting and thin media, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the branching process in the presence of an extended QCD media.</description>

This research focuses on the dilaton generation while magnetic dipole radiation from a rotating neutron star propagates through a Coulomb field created by a point-charged particle.
  The exact solution of the dilaton field equation has been obtained, and the angular distribution of dilaton generation has been established.</description>

      <title>Induced gravitational waves, metastable cosmic strings and primordial black holes in GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological and astrophysical implications of a realistic hybrid inflation model based on flipped $SU(5)$. The model contains superheavy metastable cosmic strings arising from a waterfall field that encounters a limited number of $e$-foldings during the inflationary phase. In addition to the gravitational waves emitted by the metastable strings, there also appear scalar induced gravitational waves linked to the waterfall phase transition. These two independent sources of gravitational waves can yield a combined spectrum that is compatible with the recent PTA measurements, and with additional features that can be probed in future experiments. We also show the appearance of primordial black holes with mass on the order of $10^{26}$ g from the waterfall phase transition, and with an abundance that can be tested in the gravitational lensing experiments.</description>

Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars cool by the emission of light particles like neutrinos and axions from their very dense interiors. In this article, we study in detail the photo-production of axions and neutrinos. We point out that this channel is an unavoidable consequence of the existence of the anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term and compute the relevant cooling rates. We then perform a complementary data-driven study where the rate of photo-production can be estimated from low-energy pion photo-production data. We however conclude that the cooling rates induced by the photo-production of axions and neutrinos are typically sub-dominant with respect to the main channels usually included.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Quantum-Mechanical Suppression of Gas Accretion by Primordial Black Holes"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2409.09081v1 [astro-ph.HE]) that accretion of ordinary matter on black holes of mass $(6\times 10^{14}-4\times10^{19})\,$g would be inhibited by quantum mechanical effects, namely the de Broglie wavelength of the electron being larger than the Schwarzschild radius. However the conclusion is based on considering accretion of a single atom over the age of the Universe. There is no suppression of the accretion rate per atom on such black holes.</description>

      <title>Updated cosmological constraints in extended parameter space with Planck PR4, DESI BAO, and SN: dynamical dark energy, neutrino masses, lensing anomaly, and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the updated constraints on cosmological parameters in a 12 parameter cosmology extended with dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\rm eff}$), scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), and running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). For 'CMB' data, we use the latest Planck PR4 (2020) HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods, Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing, and Planck 2018 lowl-$l$ TT likelihoods. Also, we use the latest DESI DR1 BAO likelihoods and SNeIa likelihoods from the Pantheon+ and DESY5 samples. We find: i) Contrary to the findings of DESI collaboration, we find that the CMB+BAO+Pantheon+ leads to the inclusion of cosmological constant within $2\sigma$, while CMB+BAO+DESY5 excludes the same at more than 2$\sigma$. Thus, the dynamical nature of dark energy cannot yet be considered a robust cosmological signature. As pointed out in earlier literature, the DESY5 SNe sample might have systematics which are driving the exclusion of cosmological constant. ii) We find that for certain data combinations lead to a 1$\sigma$+ detection of $\sum m_{\nu}$, and we get a posterior peak in all dataset combinations, which is an encouraging trend towards future detection. We also provide a robust bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.3$ eV (95%). Given the current uncertainty in determining the correct underlying cosmological model, we prescribe this bound for the cosmology and particle physics community. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe, we find that $A_{\rm lens}=1$ is included at 2$\sigma$ but not at $1\sigma$. This indicates that with Planck PR4 likelihoods, there is currently no lensing anomaly in a dynamical dark energy cosmology. iv) We find that even in this largely extended cosmology, the Hubble tension persists at the level of 3.2-3.9$\sigma$.

      <title>Signal model parameter scan using Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a parameter scan technique for BSM signal models based on normalizing flow. Normalizing flow is a type of deep learning model that transforms a simple probability distribution into a complex probability distribution as an invertible function. By learning an invertible transformation between a complex multidimensional distribution, such as experimental data observed in collider experiments, and a multidimensional normal distribution, the normalizing flow model gains the ability to sample (or generate) pseudo experimental data from random numbers and to evaluate a log-likelihood value from multidimensional observed events. The normalizing flow model can also be extended to take multidimensional conditional variables as arguments. Thus, the normalizing flow model can be used as a generator and evaluator of pseudo experimental data conditioned by the BSM model parameters. The log-likelihood value, the output of the normalizing flow model, is a function of the conditional variables. Therefore, the model can quickly calculate gradients of the log-likelihood to the conditional variables. Following this property, it is expected that the most likely set of conditional variables that reproduce the experimental data, i.e. the optimal set of parameters for the BSM model, can be efficiently searched. This paper demonstrates this on a simple dataset and discusses its limitations and future extensions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on $\Xi\alpha$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\Xi$-$^4{\mathrm{He}}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation functions in the high-energy nuclear collisions to investigate the nature of the $\Xi N$ interactions. We employ the folding $\Xi \alpha$ potential based on the lattice QCD $\Xi N$ interactions to compute the correlation function. The $\Xi \alpha$ potential supports a Coulomb-assisted bound state ${}^5_{\Xi}\mathrm{H}$ in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ channel, while the $\Xi^0\alpha$ channel is unbound. To examine the sensitivity of the correlation function to the nature of the $\Xi \alpha$ interaction, we vary the potential strength simulating stronger and weaker interactions. The result of the correlation function is sensitive to the existence of the bound state in the $\Xi^0 \alpha$ channel, and the characteristic behavior of the bound state remains also in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ correlation with the Coulomb interaction. The effect of the repulsive core of the $\Xi\alpha$ potential can be found in the correlation from the small source as the distinctive dip in the intermediate momentum region.</description>

      <title>Searching for displaced vertices with a gaseous tracker for a future e$^+$e$^-$ Higgs factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents results of the first full simulation study addressing prospects for observation of long-lived particles (LLPs) with the International Large Detector (ILD). Neutral LLP production, resulting in a displaced vertex signature inside the ILD's time projection chamber (TPC), is considered. We focus on scenarios interesting from the experimental perspective and perform a search based on displaced vertex finding inside the TPC volume. Two experimentally very challenging types of scenarios are explored: first, involving very soft final states due to a small mass splitting between heavy LLP and a dark matter particle to which the LLP decays, and the second one, with a light LLP production resulting in almost colinear vertex tracks because of a large boost of the LLP. The expected limits on the signal production cross section are presented for a wide range of the LLP proper lifetimes corresponding to $c\tau$ from 0.1 mm to 10 km.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed renormalisation group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1310.5817v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenological model with three active and three light sterile neutrinos is considered taking into account terrestrial experimental data, which indicate anomalies at short distances beyond the minimally modified Standard Model with three massive active neutrinos. One of the sterile neutrinos is assumed to have distinctly different mass in comparison with masses of two others, that is corresponding to a $(3+1+2)$-model of neutrinos. Model parameters values used for the description of oscillations of both active and sterile massive neutrinos into the Sun are chosen. Oscillation characteristics of solar neutrinos together with sterile neutrinos contributions have been evaluated taking into account the neutrino interaction with the matter inside the Sun with the use of the standard solar model (SSM). Results obtained correlate with observational data and can be used for development of sterile neutrinos models.</description>

Abstract: We present a calculation of the $C$-odd radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ in a dispersive formalism, concentrating on the leading pion-pole contribution in the virtual box diagrams. In particular, we show how the effect of a general pion vector form factor in the loop integral can be incorporated in a model-independent way and how the cancellation of infrared singularities proceeds in this case. The numerical results, dominated by the infrared enhanced contributions, indicate significant corrections beyond scalar QED, essentially confirming recent findings in generalized vector-meson-dominance models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the inclusive photoproduction of the $C$-odd, $S$-wave fully charmed tetraquark at electron-ion colliders within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization framework, at the lowest order in velocity and $\alpha_s$. The value of the NRQCD long-distance matrix element is estimated from two phenomenological potential models. Our studies reveal that the photoproduction of the $1^{+-}$ fully charmed tetraquark may be difficult to observe at HERA and the EicC; nevertheless, its observation prospect at the EIC appears to be bright.</description>

      <title>Accommodating the LHC Charged Higgs Boson Excess at 130 GeV in the General Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged Higgs bosons are common predictions in most extensions of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs sector. Therefore, their observation would elucidate the nature of the Higgs sector. Motivated by the ATLAS collaboration's latest analysis performed with $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ of Run 2 data intended to search for charged Higgs boson, produced in top quark decay and subsequently decaying via $H^\pm \rightarrow cb$, where an excess with a local significance of $3\sigma$ is observed at $m_{H^\pm} = 130~\rm{GeV}$, we discuss here the possibility of explaining such excess in the context of the general 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM type-III), after satisfying all theoretical and up-to-date experimental constraints. We also propose phenomenological scenarios to further explore the mass region around 130 GeV in the four Yukawa types of the 2HDM type-III and suggest alternative decay channel $H^\pm \rightarrow cs$ and/or $H^\pm \rightarrow W^{\pm *}h$ to probe the nature of the observed excess (if it is not a statistical fluctuation). Future searches for $H^\pm$ will be critical in confirming or refuting the first hint of a light charged Higgs boson at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the properties of excited charmonia is important to clarify its internal structure. In this paper, we present the mass spectra (MS) and decay constants (DC) for charmonia up to 3S states calculated by means of the light-front quark model based on a variational approach. In particular, we consider the QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian, which includes both confinement (linear and screened) and Coulomb-like potentials. Furthermore, since the existence of the nature of heavy quark symmetry, we treat hyperfine interactions perturbatively. We developed the harmonic oscillator expansion method to approximate the wave function (WF) for excited states. We found that the results of our theoretical calculations, using screened potentials rather than linear ones, are in good agreement with experimental data. By looking at the mass and decay constant result, we found that our result on the {\psi}(3S) state matched the properties of the {\psi}(4040) resonance.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the neutron lifetime puzzle, a discrepancy between beam and bottle measurements of the weak neutron decay. Since both types of measurements are realized at different times after the nuclear production of free neutrons, we argue that the existence of excited states could be responsible for the different lifetimes. We elaborate on the required properties of such states and under what circumstances it is possible that they have not been experimentally identified yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g., $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy or the rest of the cascade is measured. We comment on final state radiation's impacts on measuring the inelasticity distribution, $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation increases the overall detectable energy by as much as 20\%, affects flavor measurements, and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Many of these have significant impacts on measuring neutrino fluxes and spectra. Finally, for LHC's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitarity sets upper limits on partial-wave elastic and inelastic cross-sections, which are often violated by perturbative computations. We discuss the dynamics underlying these limits in the non-relativistic regime, namely long-range interactions, and show how the resummation of the 2-particle-irreducible diagrams arising from squaring inelastic processes unitarizes both elastic and inelastic cross-sections. We provide a simple prescription to obtain the unitarized cross-sections from those that do not include resummation of the squared inelastic processes. Our results are model-independent, apply to all partial waves, and affect elastic and inelastic cross-sections, with extensive implications for new physics scenarios, such as dark-matter freeze-out, indirect detection and self-interactions.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent observation of the Higgs boson radiative decay into $Z^0$ by {\tt ATLAS} and {\tt CMS} Collaborations, we investigate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) electroweak correction to this rare decay process in Standard Model (SM). Implementing the on-shell renormalization scheme, we find that the magnitude of the NLO electroweak correction may reach $7\%$ of the leading order (LO) prediction, much more significant than that of the NLO QCD correction, which is merely about $0.3\%$. After incorporating the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ correction, the predicted partial width from various $\alpha$ schemes tend to converge to each other. Including both NLO electroweak and QCD corrections, the SM prediction for the branching fraction shifts from the LO value of $(1.40-1.71)\times 10^{-3}$ to $(1.55\pm 0.06)\times 10^{-3}$, considerably lower than the measured value ${\cal B}_{\rm exp}[H\to Z^0\gamma]=(3.4\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-3}$. Resolving this alarming discrepancy clearly calls for further theoretical investigations, and, more importantly, experimental efforts from {\tt HL-LHC} and the prospective Higgs factories such as {\tt CEPC} and {\tt FCC-ee}.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of theories that predict a fermionic dark matter candidate from gauge anomaly cancellation. As an explicit example, we study the predictions in theories where the global symmetry associated with baryon number is promoted to a local gauge symmetry. In this context the symmetry-breaking scale has to be below the multi-TeV scale in order to be in agreement with the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density. The new physical "Cucuyo" Higgs boson in the theory has very interesting properties, decaying mainly into two photons in the low mass region, and mainly into dark matter in the intermediate mass region. We study the most important signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluating the experimental bounds. We discuss the correlation between the dark matter relic density, direct detection and collider constraints. We find that these theories are still viable, and are susceptible to being probed in current, and future high-luminosity, running.</description>

      <title>Isospin sum rules for the nonleptonic $B$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry, as the most precise flavor symmetry, can be used to extract information about hadronic dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian for bottom quark weak decay is zero under the isospin lowering operators $I_-^n$, which allows us to generate isospin sum rules through several master formulas. In this work, we derive the master formulas of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays of $B$ mesons. Numerous new isospin sum rules, especially those involving three or more decay channels, are proposed. The isospin sum rules can be used to test isospin symmetry and provide hints the isospin partners of exotic hadrons in $B$ decays. It is found ten percent isospin breaking only in decay modes involving two vector mesons, indicating the complex dynamics of vector mesons. Besides, the isospin analysis suggests the charm tetraquark resonances might be observed in the $ B^- \to J/\Psi \pi^-\overline K^0$, $\overline B^0 \to J/\Psi \overline K^0\phi$, and $\overline B^0\to D^0\overline D^0\overline K^0$ modes.</description>

      <title>Energy Growth in $V_LV_L\to V_LV_L,\ V_LV_Lh$ Scattering to Probe Higgs Cubic and HEFT Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the energy scales of perturbative unitarity violation in $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L h$ processes and compare them to $V_L V_L \to hhh$ process, where $V_L$ refers to a longitudinal mode of $Z$ or $W$ boson, and $h$ the Higgs boson. Using these energy scales, we determine which process is more sensitive to potential modifications in the Higgs sector at high-energy colliders. Within the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT), we consider the Higgs cubic coupling and other interactions with and without derivatives. Any HEFT interactions predict the perturbative unitarity violation at a finite scale, and in a generic case, the minimalistic process is $2\to 3$ scattering. Our analysis reveals that the energy scales for unitarity violation in $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L h$ and $V_L V_L \to hhh$ processes are similar across all scenarios considered. If the backgrounds are similar, $V_L V_L h$ final states are more feasible because $V_L V_L h$ has higher branching ratios in cleaner decay modes than $hhh$. We also investigate HEFT derivative interactions derived from various UV models. In these cases, both $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L$ and $V_L V_L \to hh$ processes exhibit unitarity violating behavior. We demonstrate that the energy scales for unitarity violation in $V_L V_L$ final states are comparable to or even lower than those in the $hh$ final state.</description>

      <title>$\cal{CP}$-sensitive simplified template cross-sections for $t\bar t H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\cal{CP}$ structure of the Higgs boson is a fundamental property which has not yet been constrained with high precision. $\cal{CP}$ violation in the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and top quark pair can be probed directly at the Large Hadron Collider by measuring top-quark-associated Higgs production. Multivariate analysis techniques commonly developed so far by the experiments are designed for a specific signal model and, therefore, complicate reinterpretations and statistical combinations. With this motivation in mind, we propose a $\cal{CP}$-sensitive extension of the simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework. Considering multiple Higgs decay channels, we perform an in-depth comparison of $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables and combinations thereof. Our resulting proposal is to extend the existing binning in the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson $p_{T,H}$ by either the pseudorapidity difference of the two top-quarks $\Delta \eta_{t\bar t}$, or a variable that is based on the top quark momenta, namely $b_2$ or the Collins-Soper angle $|\cos\theta^*|$. We demonstrate that this variable selection provides close to optimal sensitivity to the $\cal{CP}$ mixture in the top Yukawa coupling for an integrated luminosity of $300\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, by comparing it to the results of a multivariate analysis. Our results also suggest a benefit of the two-dimensional STXS extension at 3000$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a Heavy Neutral Lepton at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy lepton singlets $N$ slightly mixed with a standard neutrino $\nu_\ell$ are usually searched for at the LHC in the trilepton plus $p_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ channel: $pp \to W^+ \to \ell^+ N$ with $N\to \ell^- W^+ \to \ell^- \ell'^+ \nu$. We show that, although the longitudinal momentum of the final $\nu$ escapes detection, the mass of the heavy lepton can be reconstructed. This possibility has been overlooked in recent LHC searches. We show that for $m_N\approx 90$--$130$ GeV and the current luminosity (138 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV), the bounds at the LHC could be competitive with the $|V_{\ell N}|^2\leq 10^{-3}$ limits from flavor and electroweak precision data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on freeze-in dark matter from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and 21-cm signal : single-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new Lyman-$\alpha$ and 21-cm constraints on freeze-in dark matter (FIDM) which injects energy into the intergalactic medium either through annihilation or decay to photon(s) or electron-positron pair. With respect to Lyman-$\alpha$ we fix the baseline ionization history using low redshift data about astrophysical reionization, whereas for 21-cm signal we adopt the baseline values of 21-cm power spectrum through a standard modeling of star formation developed so far. Using the latest numerical tools, we show that (i) for sterile neutrino FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data and future sensitivity of SKA-low (1000 hrs) on the 21-cm power spectra excludes the FIDM mass up to $1.8\times 10^{-3}$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL and $5.46\times 10^{-4}$ GeV, respectively, and (ii) for millicharged FIDM, current Lyman-$\alpha$ data only excludes the millicharge down to $10^{-8}$ within the FIDM mass range of $10^{-3}-1$ GeV at 95$\%$ CL, suggesting that the surviving parameter space of millicharged FIDM is still intact.</description>

      <title>SU(3) symmetry analysis in charmed baryon two body decays with penguin diagram contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of experimental measurements from the BESIII, Belle, and Belle-II collaborations encourage investigations into charmed baryon two-body decay processes. By including contributions from the penguin diagrams that are ignored in previous studies, we perform a global analysis with SU(3) flavor symmetry. Assuming all form factors are real, we achieve a remarkable minimal $\chi^{2}/d.o.f = 0.788$ and find that the contribution of the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ is of the order $\sim 0.01$, comparable with the contribution of the tree-level diagram. Additionally, by using the KPW theorem to reduce the number of amplitudes from 13 to 7 in the leading contribution, it becomes possible to consider the complex form factor case for the leading IRA amplitude in the global analysis. However, the analysis of complex form factors significantly conflicts with the experimental data $Br(\Xi_c^0\to\Xi^-\pi^+)$, and by excluding this data, $\chi^2/d.o.f$ is reduced from 5.95 to 1.19. Although the analysis of complex form factors shows a significant central value of the penguin diagram contribution, the large errors from the corresponding form factors make it a challenge to precisely determine its true contribution. Consequently, the direct CP violation in decay processes is predicted to be approximately zero. With more data in future experiments, the penguin diagram contribution with the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ will be precisely determined, allowing for a more accurate prediction of CP violation. Our analysis necessitates further theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in the future.</description>

Abstract: We show that various nucleon "radii" that appear in the literature, e.g."charge", "gravitational", "mass" or "mechanical, do not have a direct geometric meaning and do not give an idea of the physical size of the nucleon.
  In the framework of the Gribov parton scheme we also show that at high enough energy a gluon cloud appears beyond the valence core of the nucleon and begins to determine the region of interaction of elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering and the growth of its cross-section.</description>

Abstract: We present quantitative results for masses and the internal structure of four-quark states with two heavy quarks, i.e. $QQ'\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ with $Q,Q'\in \{c,b\}$ and $q,q' \in \{u,d,s\}$, and $J^{P} \in {1^+}$. The composition of these states in terms of meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark pairs, extracted from a relativistic four-body Faddeev-Yakubowski equation, is dynamically determined from underlying QCD forces. We find states at energy levels in very good agreement with lattice QCD and, where available, with experimental states. Their internal structure, most notably between the $T^+_{cc}$, $T^+_{bc}$ and $T^+_{bb}$, show significant and sizeable variations.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonlinear Langevin equation from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the quantum generalized nonlinear Langevin equation using Morozov's projection operator method. This approach extends the linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator technique, allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among macroscopic modes. Additionally, we obtain the quantum generalized Fokker-Planck equation within the Heisenberg picture, which is consistent with Morozov's original formulation. These equations are fundamentally significant in non-equilibrium statistical physics, particularly in scenarios characterized by enhanced fluctuations, such as anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The quantum nature of the derived generalized Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations is anticipated to provide a more detailed description than their classical equivalents. Specifically, the noise kernel in the quantum generalized Langevin equation is multiplicative, which broadens the applicability beyond Gaussian approximations. Given specific interactions, these equations are expected to be instrumental in investigating critical transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-flavor, strange-flavor particles, and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Utilizing the Thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive of light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We have determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$7.7-200 GeV and four centralities. A significant finding was a decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ upon the inclusion of light nuclei, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This indicates that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal the presence of at least three distinct freeze-out hyper-surfaces at RHIC energies, corresponding to different chemical freeze-out temperatures: a light flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$=150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$=165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$=141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed. Instead, the chemical freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light flavor hadrons. This discrepancy may suggest different production mechanisms for light nuclei between RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to extract the low energy behavior of physical observables from their high energy expansions, systematically calculable via the operator product expansion (OPE), in asymptotically free and mass-gapped theories. By applying the inverse Laplace transform to correlation functions, their analytic structure is modified such that low-energy information connects with high energy expansions. Furthermore, this transformation alleviates the renormalon problem, enabling a more straightforward application of the OPE compared to the OPE before the transformation. We demonstrate that the low energy limit of correlation functions can be accurately extracted using the OPE in the two dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model, serving as a first testing ground.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME): the generation of an electric current due to a homogeneous background magnetic field and a homogeneous chiral imbalance in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading coefficient describing the CME vanishes in equilibrium, both for free fermions as well as in full QCD. Our full QCD results are based on continuum extrapolated lattice simulations using dynamical staggered quarks with physical masses as well as quenched Wilson quarks. We show that it is crucial that a gauge invariant ultraviolet regularization is used to compute the CME and elaborate on why some of the existing in-equilibrium calculations of this effect gave a nonzero result. We stress that our findings imply the absence of a time-independent CME current flowing in equilibrium QCD, but do not concern the CME as an out-of-equilibrium, time-dependent effect.</description>

      <title>The distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson at leading twist from Lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: Distribution amplitudes are functions of non-perturbative matrix elements describing the hadronization of quarks and gluons. Thanks to factorization theorems, they can be used to compute the scattering amplitude of high-energy processes. Recently, new ideas have allowed their computation using lattice QCD, which should provide us with a general, fully relativistic determination. We present the first lattice calculation of the $\eta_c$-meson distribution amplitude at leading twist. Starting from the relevant matrix element in discrete Euclidean space on a set of $N_f=2$ CLS ensembles, we explain the method to connect to continuum Minkowski spacetime. After addressing several sources of systematic uncertainty, we compare to Dyson-Schwinger and non-relativistic QCD determinations of this quantity. We find significant deviations between the latter and our result even at small Ioffe times.</description>

      <title>Roles of electric field/time-dependent Wilson line in toroidal compactification with or without magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effects of electric fields along compact directions within (supersymmetric) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times{\mathbb T}^2 (\times{\mathbb T}^2\times{\mathbb T}^2)$. The electric field along compact directions is equivalent to time-dependent homogeneous configuration of Wilson line moduli, which would be relevant to physics in the early universe. In particular, we consider models with and without background magnetic fluxes, which lead to completely different effects of the electric field due to the difference in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) level structure. We show that, in the case without magnetic fluxes, the deceleration of KK momenta may cause non-perturbative KK particle production dubbed as the KK Schwinger effect, whereas in the case with magnetic flux such KK particle production does not take place but flavor structure of low energy effective theory may be affected.</description>
