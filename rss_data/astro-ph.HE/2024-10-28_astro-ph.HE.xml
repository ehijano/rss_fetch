      <title>How to Escape from a Trap: Outcomes of Repeated Black Hole Mergers in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be major sources of astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs), contributing both to the observed LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA population of binary BH mergers and to future populations of LISA-band extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The ability of these BHs to pair up into binaries, inspiral, and produce GWs will be shaped by the existence of migration traps, regions in the AGN where hydrodynamic torques vanish. Previous works have studied the existence and location of migration traps in AGN disks. Here, we investigate how individual BHs may escape such traps as an outcome of mergers, potentially suppressing hierarchical growth. We find that while GW recoil kicks are strong enough to kick merged BHs onto inclined orbits, gas drag quickly realigns them into the AGN disk. A more robust escape mechanism is gap opening: once a BH grows above a critical mass, its gravity disturbs the AGN gas sufficiently to eliminate the trap. In low-mass AGN relevant for LISA, gaps open easily and the resulting ``wet EMRI'' masses are unlikely to reflect protracted hierarchical mergers. In combination with our previous work, we find that migration traps only exist in a relatively narrow range of AGN luminosities between [10^{43.5},10^{45.5}] erg/s. We identify an even narrower AGN luminosity range for which stellar mass BHs can grow into the pair instability mass gap and beyond. This characteristic luminosity scale may assist in indirect tests of the ``AGN channel'' for binary BH mergers.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>No evidence for gamma-ray emission from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope unveiled the existence of two gigantic gamma-ray lobes known as the Fermi bubbles. While their origin is still unknown, various studies identified intricate spectral and morphological structures within the bubbles. One peculiar region, the cocoon, has recently been associated with gamma-ray emissions from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr) galaxy. We assess the validity of this claim through adaptive-template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods. Our approach introduces a substantial advancement in data interpretation by enabling a data-driven optimisation of astrophysical background models, thereby reducing the impact of background mis-modelling. We do not find evidence for gamma-ray emission from the Sgr region at the level obtained in previous work. We demonstrate that there is no pronounced difference between the source population located within the cocoon region and a reference region at similar latitudes. We examine the hypothesis that a millisecond pulsar population in Sgr causes the putative signal via dedicated simulations finding that it is unlikely that we may have detected their presence in Sgr.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf -- an average-energy explosion with circumstellar medium and a precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged: The fortunate proximity of the SN2023ixf allowed astronomers to follow its evolution from almost the moment of the collapse of the progenitor's core. SN2023ixf can be explained as an explosion of a massive star with an energy of 0.7e51 erg, however with a greatly reduced envelope mass, probably because of binary interaction. In our radiative-transfer simulations, the SN ejecta of 6 Msun interact with circumstellar material (CSM) of ~0.6 Msun extending to 1.e15 cm, which results in a light curve (LC) peak matching that of SN2023ixf. The origin of this required CSM might be gravity waves originating from convective shell burning, which could enhance wind-like mass-loss during the late stages of stellar evolution. The steeply rising, low-luminosity flux during the first hours after observationally confirmed non-detection, however, cannot be explained by the collision of the energetic SN shock with the CSM. Instead, we considered it as a precursor that we could fit by the emission from ~0.5 Msun of matter that was ejected with an energy of 1.e49 erg a fraction of a day before the main shock of the SN explosion reached the surface of the progenitor. The source of this energy injection into the outermost shell of the stellar envelope could also be dynamical processes related to the convective activity in the progenitor's interior or envelope. Alternatively, the early rise of the LC could point to the initial breakout of a highly non-spherical SN shock or of fast-moving, asymmetrically ejected matter that was swept out well ahead of the SN shock, potentially in a low-energy, nearly relativistic jet. We also discuss that pre-SN outbursts and LC precursors can be used to study or to constrain energy deposition in the outermost stellar layers by the decay of exotic particles, such as axions, which could be produced simultaneously with neutrinos in the newly formed, hot neutron star.</description>

      <title>Resonant shattering flares as asteroseismic tests of chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) has proved to be a powerful microscopic framework for predicting the properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter with quantified theoretical uncertainties up to about twice the nuclear saturation density. Tests of $\chi$EFT predictions are typically performed at low densities using nuclear experiments, with neutron star (NS) constraints only being considered at high densities. In this work, we discuss how asteroseismic quasi-normal modes within NSs could be used to constrain specific matter properties at particular densities, not just the integrated quantities to which bulk NS observables are sensitive. We focus on the crust-core interface mode, showing that measuring this mode's frequency would provide a meaningful test of $\chi$EFT at densities around half the saturation density. Conversely, we use nuclear matter properties predicted by $\chi$EFT to estimate that this mode's frequency is around 185 $\pm$ 50 Hz. Asteroseismic observables such as resonant phase shifts in gravitational-wave signals and multimessenger resonant shattering flare timings, therefore, have the potential to provide useful tests of $\chi$EFT.</description>

      <title>A Two-Week $IXPE$ Monitoring Campaign on Mrk 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarization is a unique new probe of the particle acceleration in astrophysical jets made possible through the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. Here we report on the first dense X-ray polarization monitoring campaign on the blazar Mrk 421. Our observations were accompanied by an even denser radio and optical polarization campaign. We find significant short-timescale variability in both X-ray polarization degree and angle, including a $\sim90^\circ$ angle rotation about the jet axis. We attribute this to random variations of the magnetic field, consistent with the presence of turbulence but also unlikely to be explained by turbulence alone. At the same time, the degree of lower-energy polarization is significantly lower and shows no more than mild variability. Our campaign provides further evidence for a scenario in which energy-stratified shock-acceleration of relativistic electrons, combined with a turbulent magnetic field, is responsible for optical to X-ray synchrotron emission in blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Orbital-period Changes of Low-mass X-ray Binaries Driven by Magnetic Braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic braking (MB) plays an important role in driving the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The modified MB prescription, convection and rotation boosted (CARB) model, is very successful in reproducing the detected mass-transfer rates of persistent neutron star (NS) LMXBs. In this work, we investigate whether the CARB MB prescription could account for the formation and evolution of some NS and black hole (BH) LMXBs with an observed orbital period derivative. Using the MESA code, we perform a detailed binary evolution model for six NS and three BH LMXBs. Our simulations find that the CARB MB prescription can successfully reproduce the observed donor-star masses, orbital periods, and period derivatives of four NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. Our calculated effective temperatures are in good agreement with the detected spectral types of two NS LMXBs and one BH LMXB. However, the standard MB model is difficult to produce the observed period derivatives of those LMXBs experiencing a rapid orbital shrinkage or expansion.</description>

      <title>Simulations on the collision between debris stream and outer dusty torus: a possible channel for forming fast-rise and long-delayed radio outburst in tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometrically thick dusty torus structure is believed to exist in the nuclear region of galaxies (especially in active galactic nuclei, AGNs). The debris stream from a tidal disruption event (TDE) will possibly collide with the dusty torus and produce a transient flare. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the dynamical evolution of the interaction between unbound debris and dusty torus. During the continuous interaction, the shocked material will be spilled out from the interaction region and form an outflow. We calculate the temporal evolution of synchrotron emission by assuming that the shock accelerates a fraction of electrons in the outflow into a non-thermal distribution. We find that radio emission from the debris-torus collision generates a steep-rise and slow-decline radio light curve due to the sharp edge and dense gas of dusty torus, where the radio outburst delays the main optical/X-ray outburst by several years or even several tens of years. We apply our model to a TDE that happened in a narrow-line Seyfert I (PS16dtm), where both the radio spectrum and the light curve can be roughly reproduced. Future high-sensitivity, wide-field-of-view radio surveys have the opportunity to detect more such radio flares.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the dense matter equation of states in the light of the compact object HESS J1731-347</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent mass ($0.77 \pm ^{0.20}_{0.17}M_{\odot}$) and radius ($10.4\pm^{0.86}_{0.78} \text{km}$) measurement of HESS J1731-347 made it one of the most fascinating object if it is indeed a neutron star. In this work, we examine the current status of the dense matter equation of states in the context of this compact object being a neutron star. We use three sets of equation of states corresponding to the three classes - neutron stars, strange stars, and hybrid stars and perform Bayesian model selection on them. Our results show that for hadronic models, the EoS is preferred to be stiff at the intermediate densities. This makes the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation and models based on Effective-interactions deviate from current astrophysical observations on the inclusion of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, for the strange star family, the equation of states composed of three flavor quarks prefers relatively smaller bag parameters. Analyzing the hybrid family of equation of states consisting of a first-order phase transition revealed preferences for early first-order phase transition. Comparing all the preferred equations of state among each family, it was found that the current astrophysical constraints most prefer the hybrid equation of states.</description>

      <title>Mass-gap Black Holes in Coalescing Neutron Star Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a mass gap of $3-5\,M_{\odot}$ between the heaviest neutron stars (NSs) and the lightest black holes (BHs), inferred from the BH mass distribution in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), has been suggested for decades. The recently reported gravitational-wave source GW230529 has been confidently identified as a NSBH merger, with the BH mass falling within this lower mass gap. This detection provides strong evidence against the existence of the latter and introduces new implications for the coalescing NSBH population, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local merger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis code that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate coalescing NSBH binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. In particular, we focus on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger population. We find that, with a high common-envelope efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm{CE}} =2 $, the BH masses in NSBH mergers concentrate in the lower mass gap, aligning more closely with observations. However, after accounting for the constraints of the selection bias against mass-gap BHs in LMXBs, which suggests that the maximum NS birth mass is below $\simeq 2\,M_{\odot}$, we find that introducing a high $\alpha_{\rm{CE}}$ is not required to match observations. Additionally, we explore the impact of core-collapse supernova kicks. Finally, we present the property distributions of observable NSBH mergers from our simulation and find that they match well with the observations. We find that the fraction of electromagnetic counterparts in observable populations is $\approx 4-30\%$, depending on different NS equations of state. Future detections of coalescing NSBH binaries would provide invaluable insights into SN mechanisms, common envelope evolution, and NS physics.</description>

      <title>Probing red-supergiant atmospheres and winds with early-time high-cadence high-resolution type II supernova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-cadence high-resolution spectroscopic observations of infant Type II supernovae (SNe) represent an exquisite probe of the atmospheres and winds of exploding red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Using radiation hydrodynamics and radiative transfer, we study the gas and radiation properties during and after the phase of shock breakout, considering RSG progenitors enshrouded within a circumstellar material (CSM) that varies in extent, density, and velocity profile. In all cases, the original, unadulterated CSM structure is probed only at the onset of shock breakout, visible in high-resolution spectra as narrow, often blueshifted emission, possibly with an absorption trough. As the SN luminosity rises during breakout, radiative acceleration of the unshocked CSM starts, leading to a broadening of the ``narrow'' lines by ~100 and up to ~1000km/s, depending on CSM properties. This acceleration is maximum close to the shock, where the radiative flux is greater, and thus typically masked by optical-depth effects. Generally, narrow-line broadening is greater for more compact, tenuous CSM because of the proximity to the shock where the flux is born, and smaller in denser and more extended CSM. Narrow-line emission should show a broadening that slowly increases first (the line forms further out in the original wind), then sharply rises (the line forms in a region that is radiatively accelerated), before decreasing until late times (the line forms further away in regions more weakly accelerated). Radiative acceleration should inhibit X-ray emission during the early, IIn phase. Although high spectral resolution is critical at the earliest times to probe the original slow wind, radiative acceleration and associated line broadening may be captured with medium resolution allowing a simultaneous view of narrow, Doppler-broadened as well as extended, electron-scattering broadened line emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 and significantly detect the 29 keV cyclotron line features in the hard X-ray averaged spectroscopy studies based on the recent Insight-HXMT observations in 2022, when Cen X-3 has X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X} &gt; \sim 5 \times 10^{37}$ erg\ s$^{-1}$ in the bands of 2 -- 60 keV. We do not find a harmonic line in the average spectra based on different continuum models. We showed that the CRSF energies have no correlation with time or luminosity in the average spectra. In addition, by performing a pulse phase-dependent spectral analysis, we revealed the fundamental line with the centroid energy ranging from 25 to 29 keV with a high significance over the spin phases. The evolution of the cyclotron line centroid energies over pulse phase is similar to the shape of pulse profiles, illustrating a positive correlation between the energy of CRSFs and the pulse phase flux.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a shock-compressed magnetic field in the northwestern rim of Vela Jr. from X-ray polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray emission has been detected from nearly a dozen young supernova remnants (SNRs). X-rays of synchrotron origin exhibit linear polarization in a regular, non-randomly oriented magnetic field. The significant polarized X-ray emission from four such SNRs has already been reported on the basis of observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The magnetic-field structure as derived from IXPE observations is radial for Cassiopeia A, Tycho's SNR, and SN 1006, and tangential for RX J1713.7-3946. The latter together with the recent detection of a tangential magnetic field in SNR 1E 0102.2-7219 by the Australia Telescope Compact Array in the radio band shows that tangential magnetic fields can also be present in young SNRs. Thus, the dichotomy in polarization between young and middle-aged SNRs (radial magnetic fields in young SNRs, but tangential magnetic fields in middle-aged SNRs), previously noticed in the radio band, deserves additional attention. The present analysis of IXPE observations determines, for the first time, a magnetic-field structure in the northwestern rim of Vela Jr, also known as RX J0852.0-4622, and provides a new example of a young SNR with a tangential magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Influence of neutrino-electron scattering and neutrino-pair annihilation on hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of inelastic neutrino microphysics in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a hypermassive neutron star. In particular, we include species/energy groups coupled neutrino-matter interactions, such as inelastic neutrino-electron scattering and electron-positron annihilation kernels, into simulations up to 50 ms. Neutrino-electron inelastic scattering is known to have effective neutrino-matter energy exchange. We show that, with neutrino-electron inelastic scattering, simulations predict 75% higher disc mass with slightly different mass-averaged compositions, and 18% more ejected mass with similar distributions. The enhancement of the mass of the disc and the ejecta results in stronger baryon pollution, leading to less favourable jet launching environments. Furthermore, neutrino luminosities are about 50, 40, and 30% higher for electron neutrino, electron anti-neutrino, and heavy-lepton neutrinos. In contrast, we do not see any significant impacts due to electron-positron annihilation.</description>

      <title>Detection Rate of Galaxy Cluster Lensed Stellar Binary Black Hole Mergers by the Third-generation Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers can be strongly gravitational lensed by intervening galaxies/galaxy clusters. Only a few works investigated the cluster-lensed sBBH mergers by adopting oversimplified models, while galaxy-lensed ones were intensively studied. In this paper, we estimate the detection rate of cluuster-lensed sBBH mergers with the third-generation GW detectors and its dependence on the lens models. We adopt detailed modeling of galaxy cluster lenses by using the mock clusters in the Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST (CosmoDC2) and/or approximations of the pseudo-Jaffe profile or an eccentric Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a bright central galaxy with singular isothermal sphere profile. Considering the formation of sBBH mergers dominates by the channel of evolution of massive binary stars (EMBS), we find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs is $\sim5-84$ yr$^{-1}$, depending on the adopted lens model and uncertainty in the merger rate density, and it is about $\sim{13_{-2.0}^{+28}}$yr$^{-1}$ if adopting relatively more realistic galaxy clusters with central main and member galaxies in the CosmoDC2 catalog, close to the estimated detection rate of sBBH mergers lensed by galaxies. In addition, we also consider the case that the production of sBBH mergers dominated by the dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. We find that the detection rate of cluster-lensed sBBHs if from the dynamical channel is about $1.5$ times larger than that from the EMBS channel and the redshift distribution of former peaking at a higher redshift ($\sim3$) compared with that from latter ($\sim2$).</description>

      <title>Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra for the Photospheric Phase of a 3D Stripped-Envelope Supernova Explosion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present synthetic light curves and spectra from three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on a 3D core-collapse supernova explosion model of an ultra-stripped $3.5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor. Our calculations predict a fast and faint transient with $\Delta m_{15} \sim 1\texttt{-} 2\,\mathrm{mag}$ and peak bolometric luminosity between $-15.3\,\mathrm{mag}$ and $-16.4\,\mathrm{mag}$. Due to a large-scale unipolar asymmetry in the distribution of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, there is a pronounced viewing-angle dependence with about $1\,\mathrm{mag}$ difference between the directions of highest and lowest luminosity. The predicted spectra for this rare class of explosions do not yet match any observed counterpart. They are dominated by prominent Mg~II lines, but features from O, C, Si, and Ca are also found. In particular, the O~I line at \wl{7}{774} appears as a blended feature together with Mg~II emission. Our model is not only faster and fainter than the observed Ib/c supernova population, but also shows a correlation between higher peak luminosity and larger $\Delta m_{15}$ that is not present in observational samples. A possible explanation is that the unusually small ejecta mass of our model accentuates the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry. We suggest that the viewing-angle dependence of the photometry may be used to constrain asymmetries in explosion models of more typical stripped-envelope supernova progenitors in future.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reconnection with effective resistivity: I. Dynamics and reconnection rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is one of the most fundamental mechanisms considered responsible for the acceleration of relativistic particles in astrophysical jets and magnetospheres of compact objects. Understanding the properties of the dissipation of magnetic fields and the formation of non-ideal electric fields is of paramount importance to quantify the efficiency of reconnection at energizing charged particles. Recent results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggest that the fundamental properties of how magnetic fields dissipate in a current sheet might be captured by an ``effective resistivity'' formulation, which would locally enhance the amount of magnetic energy dissipated and favor the onset of fast reconnection. Our goal is to assess this ansatz quantitatively by comparing fluid models of magnetic reconnection with a non-constant magnetic diffusivity and fully-kinetic models. We perform 2D resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection combined to PIC simulations using the same initial conditions (namely a Harris current sheet). We explore the impact of crucial parameters such as the plasma magnetization, its mass density, the grid resolution, and the characteristic plasma skin depth. Our ResRMHD models with effective resistivity can quantitatively reproduce the dynamics of fully-kinetic models of relativistic magnetic reconnection. In particular, they lead to reconnection rates consistent with PIC simulations, while for constant-resistivity fluid models the reconnection dynamics is generally 10 times slower. Even at modest resolutions the adoption of an effective resistivity can qualitatively capture the properties of kinetic reconnection models and produce reconnection rates compatible with collisionless models, i.e. of the order of $\sim10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of population inversions in relativistic plasmas through nonresonant interactions with Alfv\'en waves and their applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron maser emission is a leading candidate to explain the coherent emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). This mechanism requires a population inversion in order to operate. We show that nonresonant interactions between Alfv\'{e}n waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of population inversions across a wide range of magnetizations, $\sigma\gtrsim10^{-4}$, and temperatures, $10^{-2} \leq k_bT/mc^2 \leq 3$, spanning the parameters expected in FRB environments. We calculate the fraction of energy contained in the inversion across the whole of this parameter space for the first time and we show that energy fractions of $f_{inv}\sim 0.3$ are achieved for high magnetizations $\sigma &gt;1$. The population inversion forms on time-scales compatible with the typical dynamical time-scales of magnetars for all magnetizations. Furthermore, we provide physical explanations for the behaviour of the interaction in different magnetization regimes, and identify the important characteristic values at which this behaviour changes. We also show that the mechanism is capable of producing an FRB signal at GHz frequencies in a relativistic magnetar wind close to the light cylinder and that this signal can escape the magnetar environment without significant damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are a source of very high energy (VHE) radiation that can reach up to TeV and even PeV energies. Our work uses the pulsar tree, a graph theory tool recently presented to analyze the pulsar population to select the candidates of interest.
  Aims. We aim to discover possible detectable PWNe. We also aim to test to what extent the pulsar tree groups detectable PWNe despite it considering only pulsars' intrinsic properties.
  Methods. We select four pulsars as candidates for TeV PWNe based on their positions in the pulsar tree. Using observed and assumed ranges of values for relevant parameters, we anticipate possible spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the PWNe of four pulsars (PSR J1208-6238, J1341-6220, J1838-0537, and J1844-0346) via a detailed time-dependent, leptonic model that was already found appropriate to describe almost all other detected nebulae.
  Results. We estimate the likelihood of detection for the four candidates studied by comparing the TeV fluxes predicted by the possible models with the sensitivities of different observatories. In doing so, we provide context for analyzing the advantages and caveats of the pulsar tree position as a marker for properties that go beyond the intrinsic features of pulsars that are considered in producing it.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the spectra of galactic cosmic rays by leveraging historical solar activity data, addressing the limitations of traditional transport models. By incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The inclusion of historical cosmic-ray data enhances prediction accuracy, making the model highly effective for space weather forecasting. Moreover, it provides reliable one-day-ahead predictions of full spectra of cosmic rays for different species. Our approach surpasses traditional physics-based methods, providing a scalable, data-driven solution for reliable daily and long-term forecasts. This work paves the way for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory sensitivity to heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays and the shape of particle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and the potential role of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) as cosmic-ray (CR) accelerators remain subjects of ongoing debate. To shed more light on this topic, we have studied the spectral shape of two SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946 and HAWC J2227+610, performing simulations for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The previous multi-wavelength (MWL) analysis on these two sources showed an important hadronic contribution at high energies. The interaction of the GCRs accelerated by the SNRs with the medium around the accelerator leads to a process of pion decay (PD) that produces gamma-rays ($\gamma$-rays). These emissions, detectable by CTAO, offer an indirect means of pinpointing the CR source. Two scenarios have been considered: the contribution of heavy CRs and different cut-off sharpnesses ($\beta$) of the particle spectra. The simulations were performed by using different CR composition distributions (protons, CNO, Fe) and different sharpness values ranging from $\beta$=0.5 to $\beta$=1.5. The results show that, in the cases studied here, CTAO will increase the sensitivity to the spectral shape of $\gamma$-rays. This allows us to distinguish protons from heavy CRs and obtain information on $\beta$ values and therefore on different acceleration scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Framework Characterizing the Metallicity and Star-Formation History Dependence of X-ray Binary Population Formation and Emission in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new empirical framework modeling the metallicity and star-formation history (SFH) dependence of X-ray luminous ($L &gt; 10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) point-source population luminosity functions (XLFs) in normal galaxies. We expect the X-ray point-source populations are dominated by X-ray binaries (XRBs), with contributions from supernova remnants near the low luminosity end of our observations. Our framework is calibrated using the collective statistical power of 3,731 X-ray detected point-sources within 88 Chandra-observed galaxies at $D &lt;$ 40 Mpc that span broad ranges of metallicity ($Z \approx$ 0.03-2 $Z_\odot$), SFH, and morphology (dwarf irregulars, late-types, and early-types). Our best-fitting models indicate that the XLF normalization per unit stellar mass declines by $\approx$2-3 dex from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr, with a slower age decline for low-metallicity populations. The shape of the XLF for luminous X-ray sources ($L &lt; 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) significantly steepens with increasing age and metallicity, while the lower-luminosity XLF appears to flatten with increasing age. Integration of our models provide predictions for X-ray scaling relations that agree very well with past results presented in the literature, including, e.g., the $L_{\rm X}$-SFR-$Z$ relation for high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) in young stellar populations as well as the $L_{\rm X}/M_\star$ ratio observed in early-type galaxies that harbor old populations of low-mass XRBs (LMXBs). The model framework and data sets presented in this paper further provide unique benchmarks that can be used for calibrating binary population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>A Universal Bound on QCD Axions from Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation in non-Gaussian noise using Score-Based Likelihood Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) parameter estimation typically assumes that instrumental noise is Gaussian and stationary. Obvious departures from this idealization are typically handled on a case-by-case basis, e.g., through bespoke procedures to ``clean'' non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches), as was famously the case for the GW170817 neutron-star binary. Although effective, manipulating the data in this way can introduce biases in the inference of key astrophysical properties, like binary precession, and compound in unpredictable ways when combining multiple observations; alternative procedures free of the same biases, like joint inference of noise and signal properties, have so far proved too computationally expensive to execute at scale. Here we take a different approach: rather than explicitly modeling individual non-Gaussianities to then apply the traditional GW likelihood, we seek to learn the true distribution of instrumental noise without presuming Gaussianity and stationarity in the first place. Assuming only noise additivity, we employ score-based diffusion models to learn an empirical noise distribution directly from detector data and then combine it with a deterministic waveform model to provide an unbiased estimate of the likelihood function. We validate the method by performing inference on a subset of GW parameters from 400 mock observations, containing real LIGO noise from either the Livingston or Hanford detectors. We show that the proposed method can recover the true parameters even in the presence of loud glitches, and that the inference is unbiased over a population of signals without applying any cleaning to the data. This work provides a promising avenue for extracting unbiased source properties in future GW observations over the coming decade.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a series of 739 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx25\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for gravitational waves with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an accelerated pipeline, based on high-performance computing techniques and normalizing flows, for joint Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection and demonstrate its efficiency in gravitational wave astrophysics. We integrate the Jim inference toolkit, a normalizing flow-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, with the learned harmonic mean estimator. Our Bayesian evidence estimates run on $1$ GPU are consistent with traditional nested sampling techniques run on $16$ CPU cores, while reducing the computation time by factors of $5\times$ and $15\times$ for $4$-dimensional and $11$-dimensional gravitational wave inference problems, respectively. Our code is available in well-tested and thoroughly documented open-source packages, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for the wider research community.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernova search with PineForest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large astronomical surveys has made available large and complex data sets. However, the process of discovery and interpretation of each potentially new astronomical source is, many times, still handcrafted. In this context, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool to mine large data sets and lower the burden on the domain expert. Active learning strategies are specially good in this task. In this report, we used the PineForest algorithm to search for superluminous supernova (SLSN) candidates in the Zwicky Transient Facility. We showcase how the use of previously confirmed sources can provide important information to boost the convergence of the active learning algorithm. Starting from a data set of $\sim$14 million objects, and using 8 previously confirmed SLSN light curves as priors, we scrutinized 120 candidates and found 8 SLSN candidates, 2 of which have not been reported before (AT 2018moa and AT 2018mob). These results demonstrate how existing spectroscopic samples can be used to improve the efficiency of active learning strategies in searching for rare astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>New constraints on singlet scalar dark matter model with LZ, invisible Higgs decay and gamma-ray line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM). This model features only two free parameters: the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and the quartic coupling $a_2$ between the singlet scalar and the SM Higgs doublet. Previous studies have suggested that only the resonant region remains viable under combined constraints. In this work, we revisit and refine the constraints using data from the direct detection experiment LZ, invisible Higgs decay measurements, and gamma-ray line observations conducted by Fermi-LAT and DAMPE. Our findings indicate that the latest results from LZ have significantly strengthened the constraints on the model parameters. We demonstrate that only a narrow parameter region remains viable, specifically $60.5\,\text{GeV}&lt; m_S &lt; 62.5\,\text{GeV}$ and $1.7\times10^{-4}&lt;a_2&lt; 4.7\times10^{-4}$. This suggests that a three-fold improvement in the current LZ results would thoroughly examine the parameter space below $1\,\rm{TeV}$ for the singlet scalar DM model.</description>

      <title>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>

      <title>Implications of ALP-photon conversion for the diffuse gamma-ray background associated with high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some fraction of the diffuse photon background is supposed to be linked to high-energy neutrinos by astrophysical mechanisms of production and electromagnetic cascades. This article presents a simulation study of axion-like particles (ALPs) implications for that component, exploiting transport equations. Alternations of that spectrum due to ALP-photon conversion in the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in the cases of various ALP parameters and mixing regimes at sources are studied. The results indicate considerable influence of IGMF-conversion on the ALP-photon flux even in the case of inverse ALP-photon coupling constant $M$ equal to $10^{11.5}$ GeV and some residual effects in the case of $M=10^{12}$ GeV. Furthermore, the scenario shows another aspect of a complex multimessenger interplay between IceCube and Fermi data, to a certain extent relieving the tension between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modeling a relativistic disk around a compact object, the self-gravity of the disk is often neglected while it needs to be incorporated for more accurate descriptions in several circumstances. Extending the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu self-consistent field method, we present numerical models of a rapidly rotating neutron star with a self-gravitating disk in stationary equilibrium. In particular, our approach allows us to obtain numerical solutions involving a massive disk with the rest mass $O(10^{-1})-O(10^0) M_\odot$ closely attached to a rotating neutron star. We also assess the impact of self-gravity on the internal structure of the disk and the neutron star. These axisymmetric, stationary solutions can be employed for simulations involving the neutron star-disk system in the context of high-energy transients and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Black-Hole-Forming Supernova Explosions on the Diffuse Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux spectrum, event rate, and experimental sensitivity are investigated for the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), which originates from past stellar collapses and is also known as a supernova relic neutrino background. For this purpose, the contribution of collapses that lead to successful supernova (SN) explosion and black hole (BH) formation simultaneously, which are suggested to be a non-negligible population from the perspective of Galactic chemical evolution, is taken into account. If the BH-forming SNe involve the matter fallback onto the protoneutron star for the long term, their total emitted neutrino energy becomes much larger than that of ordinary SNe and failed SNe (BH formation without explosion). Then, in the case of the normal mass hierarchy in neutrino oscillations and with half of all core-collapse SNe being BH-forming SNe, the expected event rate according to the current DSNB model is enhanced by up to a factor of two due to the BH-forming SNe. While substantial uncertainties exist regarding the duration of the matter fallback, which determines the total amount of emitted neutrinos, and the fraction of BH-forming SNe, the operation time required to detect the DSNB at Hyper-Kamiokande would be reduced by such contribution in any case.</description>

      <title>Exploring pulsar timing precision: A comparative study of polarization calibration methods for NANOGrav data from the Green Bank Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently uncovered evidence for a nanohertz gravitational wave background by precisely timing an ensemble of millisecond pulsars. The next significant milestones for these experiments include characterizing the detected background with greater precision, identifying its source(s), and detecting continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. To achieve these objectives, generating accurate and precise times of arrival of pulses from pulsar observations is crucial. Incorrect polarization calibration of the observed pulsar profiles may introduce errors in the measured times of arrival. Further, previous studies (e.g., van Straten 2013; Manchester et al. 2013) have demonstrated that robust polarization calibration of pulsar profiles can reduce noise in the pulsar timing data and improve timing solutions. In this paper, we investigate and compare the impact of different polarization calibration methods on pulsar timing precision using three distinct calibration techniques: the Ideal Feed Assumption (IFA), Measurement Equation Modeling (MEM), and Measurement Equation Template Matching (METM). Three NANOGrav pulsars-PSRs J1643$-$1224, J1744$-$1134, and J1909$-$3744-observed with the 800 MHz and 1.5 GHz receivers at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) are utilized for our analysis. Our findings reveal that all three calibration methods enhance timing precision compared to scenarios where no polarization calibration is performed. Additionally, among the three calibration methods, the IFA approach generally provides the best results for timing analysis of pulsars observed with the GBT receiver system. We attribute the comparatively poorer performance of the MEM and METM methods to potential instabilities in the reference noise diode coupled to the receiver and temporal variations in the profile of the reference pulsar, respectively.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that stellar-mass binary black holes with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead stellar-mass binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, and the locations of the two peaks are sensitive to the maximum value of $J_{\rm{sym}}$ reflecting the stiffness of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ above about 3 times the saturation density $\rho_0$ of SNM, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around $(2-3)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light Echoes and 3D Dust Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and SN 1572 (Tycho) in nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\pm0.1$ kpc and $3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars. Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the intervening HI column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the propagation of highly-energetic gamma rays in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gamma-ray observations have detected photons up to energies of a few PeV. These highly energetic gamma rays are emitted by the most powerful sources in the Galaxy. Propagating over astrophysical distances, gamma rays might interact with background photons producing electron-positron pairs, then deflected by astrophysical magnetic fields. In turn, these charged particles might scatter through inverse Compton galactic radiation fields, triggering electromagnetic cascades. In this scenario, the characterisation of astrophysical environment in which gamma rays travel, specifically background photons and magnetic fields, is crucial. We explore the impact of propagation effects on observables at Earth by simulating galactic sources emitting gamma rays with energy between $100 \; \text{GeV}$ and $100 \; \text{PeV}$. We analyse the imprint of the galactic environment on observed energy spectra and arrival direction maps, revealing gamma-ray absorption features in the former and ``deflection" of gamma rays in the latter. Specifically, owing to interstellar radiation field spatial distribution and the galactic magnetic field structure, propagation effects on observables are found to be related to the specific gamma-ray source position and to the prompt emission model. Detailed investigations of the propagation effect on galactic gamma rays will improve the robustness of both current and future gamma-ray detections and indirect dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>SN 2021foa: The "Flip-Flop" Type IIn / Ibn supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN~2021foa, unique among the class of transitional supernovae for repeatedly changing its spectroscopic appearance from hydrogen-to-helium-to-hydrogen-dominated (IIn-to-Ibn-to-IIn) within 50 days past peak brightness. The spectra exhibit multiple narrow ($\approx$ 300--600~km~s$^{-1}$) absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, calcium and iron together with broad helium emission lines with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of $\sim 6000$~km~s$^{-1}$. For a steady, wind-mass loss regime, light curve modeling results in an ejecta mass of $\sim 8$ M$_{\odot}$ and CSM mass below 1 M$_{\odot}$, and an ejecta velocity consistent with the FWHM of the broad helium lines. We obtain a mass-loss rate of $\approx 2$ M$_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. This mass-loss rate is three orders of magnitude larger than derived for normal Type II SNe. We estimate that the bulk of the CSM of SN~2021foa must have been expelled within half a year, about 15 years ago. Our analysis suggests that SN~2021foa had a helium rich ejecta which swept up a dense shell of hydrogen rich CSM shortly after explosion. At about 60 days past peak brightness, the photosphere recedes through the dense ejecta-CSM region, occulting much of the red-shifted emission of the hydrogen and helium lines, which results in observed blue-shift ($\sim -3000$~km~s$^{-1}$). Strong mass loss activity prior to explosion, such as those seen in SN~2009ip-like objects and SN~2021foa as precursor emission, are the likely origin of a complex, multiple-shell CSM close to the progenitor star.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Examining the Relationship Between the Persistent Emission and the Accretion Rate During a Type I X-ray Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accretion flow onto a neutron star will be impacted due to irradiation by a Type I X-ray burst. The burst radiation exerts Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag on the accretion disk, leading to an enhanced mass accretion rate. Observations of X-ray bursts often find evidence that the normalization of the disk-generated persistent emission (commonly denoted by the factor $f_a$) increases during a burst, and changes in $f_a$ have been used to infer the evolution in the mass accretion rate due to PR drag. Here, we examine this proposed relationship between $f_a$ and mass accretion rate enhancement using time-resolved data from simulations of accretion disks impacted by Type I X-ray bursts. We consider bursts from both spinning and non-spinning neutron stars and track both the change in accretion rate due to PR grad and the disk emission spectra during the burst. Regardless of the neutron star spin, we find that $f_a$ strongly correlates with the disk temperature and only weakly follows the mass accretion rate (the Pearson correlation coefficients are $\leq 0.63$ in the latter case). Additionally, heating causes the disk to emit at higher energies, reducing its contribution to a soft excess. We conclude that $f_a$ cannot accurately capture the mass accretion rate enhancement and is rather a tracer of the disk temperature.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>Antineutrino Opacity in Neutron Stars in the Models Constrained by Recent Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate neutral current (NC) antineutrino scattering with the constituents of neutron star (NS) matter at zero temperature. The modeling of standard matter in NS is constructed within the framework of both extended relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) and nonrelativistic Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU energy density functional (KIDS-EDF) models. In the E-RMF model, we use a new parameter, G3(M), which was constrained by the recent PREX II experiment measurement of neutron distribution in $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, while the KIDS-EDF models are constrained by terrestrial experiments, gravitational-wave signals, and astrophysical observations. Using both realistic and well-constrained matter models, we then calculate the antineutrino differential cross-section (ADCS) and antineutrino mean free path (AMFP) for the interaction between antineutrinos and neutron star (NS) matter constituents using linear response theory. It is found that the AMFP for the KIDS0 and KIDSA models are smaller compared to the SLy4 model and the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. The AMFP result of the Skyrme model with the SLy4 parameter set is found to have a prediction almost similar to that of the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. Contributions of each nucleon to the total AMFP are also presented for the G3(M) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, all vacuum black holes are described by the Kerr solution. Beyond general relativity, there is a prevailing expectation that deviations from the Kerr solution increase with the horizon curvature. We challenge this expectation by showing that, in a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, black holes scalarize in a finite, adjustable window of black-hole masses, bounded from above and below. In this theory, there is an interplay between curvature scales and compactness, which we expect to protect neutron stars and other less compact objects from scalarization. In addition, this theory is the first to avoid the catastrophic instability of early-universe cosmology that affects previous scalarization models. In this theory, black-hole uniqueness can be broken at supermassive black-hole scales, while stellar-mass black holes remain well-described by the Kerr solution. To probe this scenario, observations targeting supermassive black holes are necessary.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the accretion flow around a giant planet using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by studying the local region of accretion disk around the planet. The results show that, when the initial orbit of the planet embedded in protoplanetary disk is eccentric, the accretion disk formed around the planet is retrograde during the evolution and may be a possible origin of the retrograde ring around eccentric extrasolar giant planet.</description>

      <title>The Flavor Composition of Supernova Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux, even with the enormous uncertainties originating from self-induced flavor conversions in the supernova core. Assuming an arbitrary initial flavor composition emerging from the supernova core, we find that, for the normal mass ordering, the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching the Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase, whereas, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e}\approx 1/3$). In case adiabaticity is violated in the region of standard matter effects (e. g. due to shock waves), the result is flavor equipartition for both mass orderings. These results could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from the supernova core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint in explaining the experimental data on neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for those existing experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path as well as their totals, which is given by a sum of the Standard Model and nonstandard interaction.</description>

A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy) and seeing (via VLBI imaging) BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravitational-wave backgrounds from conversions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves ($f \gtrsim 1$ MHz) may provide a unique signature for the existence of exotic physics. The lack of current and future gravitational-wave experiments sensitive at those frequencies leads to the need of employing different indirect techniques. Notably, one of the most promising one is constituted by graviton-photon conversions in magnetic fields. In this work, we focus on conversions of a gravitational-wave background into photons inside the Milky-Way magnetic field, taking into account the state-of-the-art models for both regular and turbulent components. We discuss how graviton-to-photon conversions may lead to imprints in the cosmic photon background spectrum in the range of frequencies $f\sim10^{9}-10^{26}\,$Hz, where the observed photon flux is widely explained by astrophysics emission models. Hence, the absence of any significant evidence for a diffuse photon flux induced by graviton-photon conversions allows us to set stringent constraints on the gravitational-wave strain $h_c$, strengthening current astrophysical bounds by $\sim1-2$ orders of magnitude in the whole range of frequencies considered.</description>

      <title>Average speed of sound in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of the dense-matter equation of state is essential for the phenomenology of neutron stars. In this work, I relate the thermodynamic properties to the average speed of sound in the interior of a star. I study the consequences of the vanishing of the trace anomaly. In particular, I show that if the trace anomaly vanishes in the centers of maximally massive neutron stars, the speed of sound likely exceeds its conformal value and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior. I also find that the additional assumption of positive definiteness of the trace anomaly naturally induces a local peak of the speed of sound at densities realized in the cores of neutron stars. I also reanalyze the stability condition for hybrid neutron stars. Possible implications for the dense matter equation of state and the phenomenology of neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are one of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of moderately dense cold quark matter is investigated within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that in the regime of weak and intermediate diquark coupling strength, the color-spin-locked (CSL) phase could be most favored, and the density range where CSL phase survives is determined by two quark chemical potentials: one corresponding to the chiral phase transition and the other for the emergence of the gapless color-flavor-locked (CFL) condensate. Based on the theoretical hypothesis that the quark star could be the hideout for CSL quark matter, an interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process of a proper quark star. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the star with a critical strength, while in some special cases, a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. An analysis on energetics and time scale is performed to investigate if this expulsion of magnetic flux could power or induce high-energy electromagnetic emissions.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>
