      <title>Exploring the effects of $\alpha$-clustered structure of $^{16}O$ nuclei in anisotropic flow fluctuations in $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at the LHC within a CGC+Hydro framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effects of the presence of clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$ in the final state elliptic flow fluctuations through $^{16}O$-$^{16}O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV within a hybrid model, IPGlasma+MUSIC+iSS+ UrQMD. We compare the results of elliptic flow fluctuations using $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure to the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile having no clustered structure. We observe a significant difference in the elliptic flow fluctuations, which arise due to the consideration of a clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}O$.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poincar\'{e} Stresses: A Modern Quantum Field Theory Take on Hydrogen's Electromagnetic Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the longstanding electromagnetic mass problem from a modern quantum field theory perspective. Focusing on a system of two widely separated hydrogen atoms, one in an excited $nS$ state and the other in the ground $1S$ state, we isolate the electromagnetic contribution to the electron's total linear momentum by comparing the full energy-momentum tensor with the predictions of a point-like bound state model. Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a non-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully capture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>RVV$\times$V: Interference contributions to inclusive Higgs boson and Drell-Yan production at N$^4$LO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present partonic contributions to the inclusive gluon-fusion Higgs boson and Drell-Yan production cross sections at Hadron colliders at next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^4$LO). Specifically, we compute contributions due to the interference of one-loop amplitudes with two-loop amplitudes with three QCD partons and the Higgs boson or a virtual photon. Our result is in the form of a Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$, the coefficients of which are analytic functions in the ratio of the Higgs boson or virtual photon mass to the partonic center of mass energy. Furthermore, we introduce and deploy a new package implemented in Mathematica, CIFAR ("Color Invariant Feynman Amplitude Reducer"), to express color factors in terms of general Casimir invariants of simple compact Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic neutrinos as probes of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of extremely energetic cosmic rays with both cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light, can produce $\mathcal{O}(10^{18} \,{\rm eV})$ neutrinos, known as cosmogenic neutrinos. These neutrinos are the only messengers from the extreme cosmic accelerators that can reveal the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to achieving their detection. In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar \nu_\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model physics. We identify three well-motivated scenarios which induce distinct features in the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum at Earth: neutrino self-interactions mediated by a light scalar ($\nu$SI), pseudo-Dirac neutrinos (PD$\nu$) and neutrinos scattering on ultra-light Dark Matter ($\nu$DM). We show these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic neutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current experiments. For the $\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the coupling to $\nu_\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass in the range 0.1 to 1 GeV. For PD$\nu$, we find that GRAND is sensitive to sterile-active mass squared splitting in the range [$10^{-15},10^{-13}$] ${\rm eV}^2$. Finally, for the $\nu$DM model, assuming a heavy mediator, GRAND can do substantially better than the current limits from other available data. These results rely on the fact that the actual cosmogenic flux is around the corner, not far from the current IceCube limit.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moments of electron and $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Refs. [1,2] we provided a complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While the evaluation strategy was developed for the kinematic situation determined by the muon mass, a similar approach also applies to the HLbL corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and $\tau$ lepton, shifting the sensitivity in the loop integrals to smaller and larger momenta, respectively. In this Letter, we propagate the corresponding uncertainties of the various contributions, obtaining $a_e^\text{HLbL}= 3.51(23)\times 10^{-14}$ and $a_\tau^\text{HLbL}= 3.77(29)\times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Dark matter phase-in: producing feebly-interacting particles after a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freeze-in mechanism describes the out-of-equilibrium production of dark matter (DM) particles via feeble couplings or non-renormalisable interactions with large suppression scales. In the latter case, predictions suffer from a strong sensitivity to the initial conditions of the universe, such as the details of reheating. In this work, we investigate how this sensitivity is altered in the presence of a cosmological first-order phase transition. We show that freeze-in via non-renormalisable interactions is not always dominated by the highest temperatures of the Standard Model (SM) thermal bath, but instead may be governed by the period immediately after the phase transition, during which the decaying scalar field transfers its energy density to the SM radiation. We refer to this alternative production regime as DM $\textit{phase-in}$. Using numerical and approximate analytical solutions of the relevant Boltzmann equations, we determine the conditions that under which phase-in or conventional freeze-in production dominates the final DM abundance in terms of the type of interaction between the DM and SM particles, the amount of supercooling before and the evolution of the scalar field after the phase transition. In the phase-in regime, the DM abundance is correlated with the peak frequency of the gravitational wave signal associated with the phase transition, opening up new observational possibilities.</description>

      <title>t-channel dark matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report, summarising work achieved in the context of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, investigates the phenomenology of $t$-channel dark matter models, spanning minimal setups with a single dark matter candidate and mediator to more complex constructions closer to UV-complete models. For each considered class of models, we examine collider, cosmological and astrophysical implications. In addition, we explore scenarios with either promptly decaying or long-lived particles, as well as featuring diverse dark matter production mechanisms in the early universe. By providing a unified analysis framework, numerical tools and guidelines, this work aims to support future experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring $t$-channel dark matter models at colliders and in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations and scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum using scattering theory methods developed earlier in the context of collider physics. It is computed from Feynman diagrams that combine neutrino production and detection processes into a single quantum amplitude. Initial-state particles in the neutrino source and the detector are treated as wave packets. In contrast to many other approaches, we work with transition probabilities, rather than the amplitude itself, and do not specify the form of the wave packets to arrive at the neutrino oscillation formula. Our approach offers a simple and transparent framework to discuss decoherence effects in neutrino oscillations, as well as the effects of the finite lifetime of the neutrino source. The latter are particularly relevant for oscillation experiments using neutrinos from pion decays in flight.</description>

      <title>Energy-Enhanced Expansion of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize energy-scaling arguments in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to estimate effects of operators up to dimension ten. Introducing a classification based on the number of external legs and an energy-counting parameter, we establish a dual expansion in \(v/\Lambda\) and \(E/\Lambda\). Extending to four-, five-, and six-particle vertices, our framework highlights energy-enhanced operators that dominate high-energy processes at the HL-LHC. This organization streamlines experimental analyses to only include operators with energetic impact in their analyses and enhances the discoverability of new physics within the SMEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum and magnetic moments of singly-charmed baryons: a quark-diquark model analysis of $\Omega_{c}(3185)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3327)^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on singly-heavy baryons, especially those with a charm quark, offers a distinct perspective on the nonperturbative behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we investigate the recently observed $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ and $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ are singly-charmed baryons within the framework of the quark-diquark model. By employing a nonrelativistic method with a Cornell-like potential, we systematically determine magnetic moments and mass spectra. Our analysis reveals that the $\Omega_{c}(3185)^{0}$ can be effectively described as a $2S$ state with quantum numbers $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{+}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$, or alternatively as a $1P$ state with $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ or $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, depending on the diquark configuration. Similarly, the $\Omega_{c}(3327)^{0}$ is consistent with a $2S$ configuration. We also investigate through magnetic moments, emphasizing the critical role of diquark correlations in shaping the electromagnetic properties of these states. Our results not only validate existing theoretical models but also offer new insights into the nature of singly-heavy baryons, setting the stage for future experimental and theoretical investigations in heavy baryon spectroscopy. This paper emphasizes the importance of diquark configurations in elucidating the mass spectrum and electromagnetic characteristics of singly-charmed baryons, aiding the overarching endeavor to decipher the intricacies of QCD.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on modulus stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) two-brane model, the radion potential was fine-tuned to zero, leaving the extra-dimensional modulus undetermined. Goldberger and Wise (GW) introduced a stabilization mechanism by incorporating a massive bulk scalar field, leading to a radion potential with a stable minimum. In this work, we examine the impact of the intrinsic stability of the GW scalar field on the modulus stabilization procedure. To elucidate this relationship, we test the stabilization scheme across several relevant scenarios using methods of singular perturbation theory. Our analysis consistently indicates a one-to-one correspondence between the stability of the GW scalar and successful modulus stabilization. Additionally, we highlight that certain classes of GW bulk potentials elevate the possibility of such a correspondence, and provide checks which any GW bulk potential must satisfy in order to ensure modulus stabilization.</description>

      <title>Strongly electroweak phase transition with $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ gauged non-zero hypercharge triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers three non-zero hypercharge triplets as an extension of the Standard Model Higgs doublet. Under extra $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry, the triplets are charged. We examine the stability of the electroweak vacuum at the two-loop and tree-levels. The two-loop $\beta$-functions are found to be capable of satisfying the vacuum stability up to the Planck scale. On the other hand, only up to $10^{12}$ GeV can the perturbative unitarity be satisfied because of the increase in the positive influence from triplet degrees of freedom. For the strongly electroweak first-order phase transition, the parameter space permitted by the Planck scale stability is examined. Because the triplet degrees of freedom contribute sufficiently to the cubic term, the model satisfies the strongly first order phase transition for the triplet bare mass parameters up to the TeV scale. For all mass ranges, it is found that this model predicts a strongly first-order phase transition until the degrees of freedom are heavy enough to separate from the thermal bath. The gravitational wave signatures are tested at the benchmark places that fulfill the strongly first-order phase transition. The measurable frequency range of the LISA and BBO experiments also turns out to contain the benchmark points permitted by Planck scale stability, strongly first-order phase transition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the recent observation of $CP$-violation in bottom baryon decays, we explore $CP$-asymmetry relations in charmless four-body decays of bottom baryons featuring fully charged hadronic final states. Starting with a general effective Hamiltonian, we derive amplitude relations among various decay modes within the framework of $U$-spin symmetry. These relations lead to symmetry-based predictions for $CP$-violating rate asymmetries in $U$-spin conjugate decay channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all leading-order amplitude relations are violated once $U$-spin breaking effects are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of $\eta_{1}(1855)$ and it's partner in a chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental discoveries of \(X(3872)\) (\(c\bar{q}\)-\(q\bar{c}\)) and \(T_{cc}\) (\(c\bar{q}\)-\(c\bar{q}\)), we systematically study two four-quark systems: the \(K K_1\) (\(q\bar{s}\)-\(q\bar{s}\)) system and the \(K \bar{K}_1\) (\(q\bar{s}\)-\(s\bar{q}\)) system, which is a candidate for the recently observed \(\eta_1(1855)\). Within the framework of an accurate few-body calculation method (GEM), we employ the chiral quark model to simultaneously consider the molecular and diquark structures of these two multiquark systems and include their channel coupling effects. Our results show that the \(K \bar{K}_1\) system remains a scattering state. On the other hand, due to the presence of a good-diquark structure in the \(K K_1\) system, we obtain a bound state in the coupled-channel calculation. The primary contribution to the binding energy comes from the exchange of \(\pi\)-meson and \(\sigma\)-meson. The inter-quark distance indicates that it is a compact four-quark structure.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Electroweak Phase Transition in the $Z_2$ Symmetric Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the $Z_2$ symmetric Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, focusing on the dark matter (DM) in the model and the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). Our analysis encompasses multiple detections for the DM candidates, including collider searches at the LHC and LEP, the direct detection and indirect detection. Furthermore, we also explore the possibility of a first-order EWPT in this framework. The gravitational wave (GW) generated from the first-order EWPT also provides a detection method for the parameter space in the $Z_2$ symmetric GM model providing viable DM candidate. It is found that the current DM searches, especially the direct detection, provide strong constraints on the parameter space, while the GW signal can be complementary around the Higgs resonant region.</description>

      <title>Investigating the light curve variation of magnetic white dwarfs induced by the axion-photon conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-photon oscillation refers to the process of mutual conversion between photons and axions when they propagate in a magnetic field. This process depends on the strength of the background magnetic field, and magnetic white dwarfs provide a natural laboratory for testing this process. In this work, we study the behavior of axion-photon oscillation near magnetic white dwarfs: as the magnetic white dwarf rotates, its magnetic field structure rotates accordingly, causing a periodic change of the magnetic field along the path of photons. These variations affect the axion-photon oscillation process experienced by the photons emitted from the white dwarf, thereby inducing a periodic modulation in the intensity and polarization of the white dwarf's thermal emission that we observe. Our study focuses on the impact of axion effects on the observed light curve variation and conducts a detailed investigation through numerical calculations. Using the light curve data of the white dwarf PG1015+014 obtained from the observations by the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, which has a photometric precision of $\sim1\%$, we derive the constraints on axion parameters. In the axion mass range of $\lesssim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$, the 95\% credible interval upper limit of the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ is constrained to $&lt;8.1 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Origin of Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactor antineutrino anomaly, discovered in 2011, means a noticeable difference between the observed rate of inverse beta decays and the expected (theoretical) rate of such processes based on the measurement of the spectra of electrons in beta decay of $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{241}$Pu, and $^{238}$U nuclei and their subsequent conversion into right-handed antineutrino spectra. This paper provides a rationale for the fact that both right-handed and left-handed antineutrinos are produced in beta decays of nuclei. But the conversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each electron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse beta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is produced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard electroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode caused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and nucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino converts it into a free left-handed antineutrino.</description>

      <title>$B$ meson decays to vector charmonium(like) states and a $K$ meson: the role of final-state interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of vector charmonium(like) states, accompanied by a $K$ meson, have been observed in the decays of $B$ meson. These processes are color-suppressed at the quark level, as inferred from topological diagram analysis. In this work, we calculate the branching fractions of the decays $B \to \psi K$, where $\psi$ denotes the charmonium(like) states $\psi(1S)$, $\psi(2S)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(3770)$, and $\psi(4160)$. Our analysis incorporates both short-distance (naive factorization approach) and long-distance (final-state interactions) contributions. Within reasonable parameters, our results align with experimental data except for the $ \psi(4160)$, suggesting its possible exotic nature. Furthermore, we find that long-distance contributions dominate these decay processes, highlighting the crucial role of final-state interactions in the productions of charmonium(like) states in $B$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $P$-wave single charmed baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\bf\bar3_F$ within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. We systematically calculate their strong and radiative decay properties using the light-cone sum rule method. Besides the $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\Xi_c(2790)$, and $\Xi_c(2815)$, our results suggest the existence of two additional $\Lambda_c$ baryons and two additional $\Xi_c$ baryons. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and decay properties are summarized in Table V for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation in Z Boson Mass Measurements at High-Energy Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension to the Standard Model by introducing a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) term into the Z boson's dispersion relation, expressed as $p_\mu p^\mu = M_Z^2 + \delta_{LIV} (p_\mu n^\mu)^2$, where $\delta_{LIV}$ defines the violation scale and $n^\mu$ is a unit Lorentz vector specifying the direction. This modification alters the Z boson propagator and decay rate, impacting the Drell-Yan process cross-section at high-energy colliders. Observable effects are most pronounced near the resonance region at high rapidities ($|Y| &gt; 4$), potentially shifting the perceived Z boson mass and inducing sidereal-time modulations for spacelike and lightlike LIV due to Earth's rotation. We outline a targeted search strategy for ATLAS and CMS, achieving sensitivity to LIV signatures down to $|\delta_{LIV}| \approx 10^{-8}$ (or $10^{-9}$ optimistically), offering new insights into historical and future collider data. Our model predicts systematic shifts in weak boson masses at higher collision energies, relevant to past Tevatron and LHC discrepancies, though current data are now consistent.</description>

      <title>Domain wall evolution beyond quartic potentials: The Sine-Gordon and Christ-Lee potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls are the simplest type of topological defects formed at cosmological phase transitions, and one of the most constrained. Their studies typically assume a quartic double well potential, but this model is not fully representative of the range of known or plausible particle physics models. Here we study the cosmological evolution of domain walls in two other classes of potentials. The Sine-Gordon potential allows several types of walls, interpolating between different pairs of minima (which demands specific numerical algorithms to separately measure the relevant properties of each type). The Christ-Lee potential parametrically interpolates between sextic and quartic behavior. We use multiple sets of simulations in two and three spatial dimensions, for various cosmological epochs and under various choices of initial conditions, to discuss the scaling properties of these networks. In the Sine-Gordon case, we identify and quantify deviations from the usual scaling behavior. In the Christ-Lee case, we discuss conditions under which walls form (or not), and quantify how these outcomes depend on parameters such as the energy difference between the false and true vacua and the expansion rate of the Universe. Various biased initial conditions are also addressed in appendices. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible cosmological implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Constraints from muon $g-2$ on a gauged non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ model with inverse see-saw neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects on a non-universal $U(1)_{X}$ extension of the Standard Model given the alternative value obtained by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal (BMW) group for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $g-2$. The model explains the fermion mass hierarchy through the non-universality of the extra gauge symmetry and by an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry, where the heaviest fermions acquire their masses from two different scales determined by two Higgs doublets and one singlet, whereas the lightest fermions obtain their masses from radiative corrections. From cancellation of chiral anomalies, the model also includes heavy extra fermions, both charged and neutral. The latter are right-handed neutrinos that acquire masses via an inverse see-saw mechanism, reproducing the observed squared mass differences for the active neutrinos. Using the latest lattice calculation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, we compute the dominant one-loop diagrams mediated by the $W$ and charged Higgs bosons, both with a heavy Majorana neutrino in the loop, setting bounds for masses of the new particles. We also provide predictions for observables that can probe our model in the future such as charged lepton flavor violating searches at Belle II like $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $\tau\to e\gamma$ and at MEG II for $\mu\to e\gamma$.</description>

      <title>NNLO predictions with nonlocal subtractions and fiducial power corrections in GENEVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD fully-differential corrections within the GENEVA framework, for both colour-singlet and colour-singlet+jet processes at hadron colliders, by employing a nonlocal subtraction approach. In particular, we discuss the implementation details and the challenges that arise when utilizing a dynamical infrared cutoff parameter. Additionally, we combine the subtraction with the projection-to-Born method in order to include fiducial power corrections. As a test case, we provide predictions for Drell-Yan and $Z$+jet production at the LHC, using $N$-jettiness as resolution variable. We validate the NNLO corrections of GENEVA against NNLOJET finding excellent agreement. Finally, we discuss how to extend our method to calculate the N$^3$LO QCD fully-differential corrections to colour-singlet production at hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>$27 \otimes 27$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decomposition into $SU(N)$ irreducible representations (irreps) of the tensor product $27 \otimes 27$, where $27$ is the highest-dimensional $SU(N)$ irrep present in a two-gluon system, and explicitly construct all Hermitian projectors on these irreps, as well as transition operators between them. This yields an explicit basis of the complete $27\otimes 27$ color space (defined as the space of $27\otimes 27\to 27 \otimes 27$ color maps) in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique, using only elementary tools. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of the quadratic Casimir operator, whose eigenspaces allow efficient filtering of all projectors and transition operators, and of the permutation operators that further improve this filtering. The product $27\otimes 27$ also has an interesting feature: three equivalent irreps $27$ appear in the decomposition, two of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the quadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this case, it is convenient to use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to derive the two associated, symmetric projectors. The latter are not uniquely determined (only their sum is), and we give the set of all solutions. Finally, we explicitly derive the soft anomalous dimension matrix associated with $27\otimes 27\to 27\otimes 27$, whose block-diagonal main structure is easy to understand, but whose detailed spectrum properties remain intriguing. The approach presented for $27 \otimes 27 \to 27 \otimes 27$ could in principle be applied to any product of $SU(N)$ irreps, and eventually automated.</description>

      <title>Determination of the first-generation quark couplings at the Z-pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak Precision Measurements are stringent tests of the Standard Model and sensitive probes to New Physics. Accurate studies of the $Z$-boson couplings to the first-generation quarks, which are currently constrained from LEP data to a few percent, could reveal potential discrepancies from the theory predictions. Future $e^+e^-$ colliders running at the $Z$-pole would be an excellent tool for an analysis based on a comparison of radiative and non-radiative $Z$ boson decays. In this paper, we present a method to extract the values of the $Z$ couplings to light quarks and discuss the uncertainty of the measurement, including contributions from various systematic effects. We show that systematic uncertainty in the heavy-flavour tagging performance is the key factor in the analysis and reducing it to a sub-permille level might be crucial to fully profit from the high luminosity of future $e^+e^-$ machines. The measurement could improve the LEP results by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon have been measured with remarkable precision, the magnetic moment of the $\tau$-lepton is only known to rather limited precision. A promising approach to measure it exploits $\tau^+\tau^-$ production in ultraperipheral collisions of lead ions at the LHC. In this article, a state-of-the-art theory prediction for $\tau^+\tau^-$ production including leptonic $\tau$-decays is provided. The impact of spin correlations between the $\tau$-leptons, of the masses of final-state leptons, of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections, and of the parametrization of the photon flux are discussed.</description>

      <title>Combined Evidence for the $X_{17}$ Boson After PADME Results on Resonant Production in Positron Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati has reported an excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons. While the global significance remains at the $1.8\,\sigma$ level, the excess is centered around $\sqrt{s} \sim 17\,\text{MeV}$, coinciding with the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C, thereby strengthening the case for a common underlying origin, possibly involving a hypothetical new $X_{17}$ boson. We discuss the significance of this independent accelerator-based evidence. Combining it with existing nuclear physics results, we obtain a value for the $X_{17}$ mass of $m_{X_{17}} = 16.88 \pm 0.05\,$ MeV, reducing the uncertainty from nuclear physics determinations alone by more than a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Confining Quantum Chromodynamics Model for 3-Quark Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a model for the relativistic bound states of 3-quark baryons based on confining quantum chromoynamics (QCD) with general Yang-Mills symmetry. The model postulates that 3-quark states are formed by consecutive 2-body collisions. For a proton, d and u quarks get together first, and then they capture another u quark so that the d quark is at the core to form a stable proton state with intergral electric charge. The two u quarks form a quantum spheric shell and move in a confining potential $C(r)= Q' r$ of the core d quark. The confining potential $C(r)$ is a static solution of new `phase' fields satisfying the fourth-order equation based on general Yang-Mills symmetry. The two u quarks with the confining potentials $C(r)$ in the spherical shell can produce an effective quark Hooke potential $V_{qH}(r)=Qr^2 + V_o$ for the d quark at the core, where Q and $Q'$ are not independent. The proton mass is assumed to be approximately given by
  $ E(d) + 2E(u)$, which can be obtained analytically from Dirac Hamiltonians involving $V_{qH}(r)$ and $C(r)$ for d and two u quarks respectively. The model gives a reasonable understanding of roughly 120 baryon masses based on two different coupling constants and one free parameter $V_o$ for sub-spectra specfied by $J^P$. These results are roughly within 20\% in percent deviation, which appears to be independent of the assumption of color charges. The confining QCD model also gives the neutron-proton mass difference $\approx 0.6 MeV$.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Power Spectrum and Non-Gaussianities With Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of the same fast radio burst (FRB) source along multiple sightlines to measure the primordial power spectrum and Non-Gaussianities. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of 100 AU, achieved by sending three or more radio telescopes to the outer solar system. The Shapiro time delays, measured relatively between different telescopes, are sensitive to the gradient field of the gravitational potential between different sightlines. Since the arrival time difference is independent of when the transient signal is emitted from the source, every measurement of the detected FRB source can be correlated. With enough FRB sources discovered, we can map the gravitational potential across the sky. We further calculate the two-point and three-point correlation function of the arrival time difference between telescopes for different FRB sources in the sky. If $10^4$ FRBs were to be detected, our results suggest that this technique can test the inflationary scale-invariant power spectrum down to $\sim 10^3\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and primordial Non-Gaussianities at a level of $f_{\rm NL}\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Sakai-Sugimoto Model in an Off-Shell: Chiral Lagrangian to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model is famous for implementing the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and reproducing the Chiral Lagrangian in a top-down approach. Off-shell holography is a formalism most suitable for derivation of boundary effective actions. In this manuscript, we revisit the original Sakai-Sugimoto model using the off-shell formalism. Thus derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-) vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we calculate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proposed half a century ago, the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion explains the lack of charge and parity violation in the strong interactions and is a compelling candidate for cold dark matter. The last decade has seen the rapid improvement in the sensitivity and range of axion experiments, as well as developments in theory regarding consequences of axion dark matter. We review here the astrophysical searches and theoretical progress regarding the QCD axion. We then give a historical overview of axion searches, review the current status and future prospects of dark matter axion searches, and then discuss proposed dark matter axion techniques currently in development.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios where stochastic effects play a crucial role. Peculiar to multi-field models, the noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields generically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts forever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of fields may fail to realise our observable Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole (PBH) is formed. In this Letter, we report a new source of the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of sound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Abundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially detectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne detectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can reproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in various analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models using a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to study the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the scale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior. In this context, the three-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears to be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the three-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_4$) variant by a factor of $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -6$, while the GT approach as a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with at least $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -8$ ($\mathcal{S}_3$) to $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -13$ ($\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and DESI-DR2 datasets.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</description>

      <title>Quark-hadron duality and the determination of $\alpha_s$ from hadronic $\tau$ decay: facts vs. myths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-perturbative effects have a small but non-trivial impact on the determination of the strong coupling from hadronic $\tau$ decay data. Several approaches have been proposed to take these into account, the two most important of which are the ``truncated OPE'' approach and ``DV-model'' approach. Recently, Pich and Rodr\'iguez-S\'anchez have raised a number of criticisms of the latter approach, including, most notably, claims of the existence of (i) a supposed instability with respect to variations of the model for incorporating quark-hadron duality violations, and (ii) an alleged redundancy in the fitting strategy employed in the DV-model approach. In this paper, we address these criticisms one by one, showing they fail to survive more detailed scrutiny of the mathematical or numerical arguments that underpin them. We also show that, while the redundancy claim does not apply to the DV-model approach, it does, in fact, apply to the truncated OPE approach. In particular, the $\alpha_s$ value determined in the latter turns out to derive purely from perturbation theory, with no role played by the non-perturbative condensates determined in the rest of the analysis. This leads to the conclusion that a revision of the conventional understanding of what is learned from truncated OPE analyses is necessary and that only very limited self-consistency checks are possible within this framework. These observations raise new, non-trivial issues for the truncated OPE approach.</description>

      <title>A Procedure g5anchor to Anchor $\gamma_5$ in Feynman Diagrams for the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a procedure g5anchor to anchor $\gamma_5$ in the definition of a Dirac trace with $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularization (DR) in Feynman diagrams for the Standard Model, based on a recent revision of the works by Kreimer, Gottlieb and Donohue. For each closed fermion chain with an odd number of primitive (i.e.~not-yet-clearly-defined) $\gamma_5$ in a given Feynman diagram, g5anchor returns a definite set of anchor points for $\gamma_5$, in terms of pairs of ordered fermion propagators; at each of these $\gamma_5$ anchor points a fixed expression in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor and elementary Dirac matrices will be inserted together with a sign determined by anticommutatively shifting all $\gamma_5$ from their original places (dictated by the Feynman rules) to this anchor point. The defining expressions for the cyclic $\gamma_5$-odd Dirac traces in DR associated with closed fermion chains in amplitudes, or more generally squared amplitudes, thus follow from this procedure, where the Levi-Civita tensors are not necessarily treated strictly in 4-dimensions. We propose utilizing this definition in practical perturbative calculations in the Standard Model at least to two-loop orders with the current implementation. Certain limitations and modifications of the KKS and/or the Kreimer scheme are addressed, as well as the possible caveats with g5anchor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac Scotogenic model provides an elegant mechanism for generating small Dirac neutrino masses at the one-loop level. A single abelian discrete $Z_{6}$ symmetry simultaneously protects the ``Diracness'' of the neutrinos and the stability of the dark matter candidate. This symmetry originates as an unbroken subgroup of the so-called 445 $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. Here, we thoroughly explore the phenomenological implications of this construction, including an analysis of electroweak vacuum stability, charged lepton flavor violation, and the dark matter phenomenology. After considering all constraints, we also show that the model allows for the possibility of novel low-mass scalar and fermionic dark matter, a feature not shared by its canonical Majorana counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Theory predictions of heavy-hadron lifetime ratios critically depend on precise determinations of the dimension-six spectator effects arising from the double insertion of the weak effective $|\Delta B| = 1$ Hamiltonian. In the presence of beyond-standard-model (BSM) operators, the resulting $\Delta B = 0$ Hamiltonian features additional four-quark operators whose matrix elements need to be determined using non-perturbative methods. We present for the first time results for the non-perturbative hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark operators relevant for the description of the meson lifetime ratio $\tau\left(B^+\right) / \tau\left(B_d\right)$, obtained using heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) sum rules with the full BSM effective Hamiltonian. In addition, we recompute and update the bag parameters for the Standard Model operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Right handed weak-currents (RHCs) in the left-right (L-R) symmetric model for neutrinoless double beta decays (DBDs) of both the $0^+~\to~0^+$ and $0^+~\to~2^+$ transitions are discussed from both theoretical and experimental view points. $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;$-terms are related by $&lt;\lambda&gt;/&lt;\eta&gt; \approx \tan\beta$, which is constrained in the regions of $1-60$ for SUSY grand unified theories (GUTs) and of $1-165$ for non-SUSY GUTs. The enhancement mechanisms of the $&lt;\eta&gt;$ term over the $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ term in the $0^+$ transition are shown, and the $\Delta$ isobar contribution to the NME for the transition to the 2$^+$ state is found to be of the order of $20\%$ of the NME with the quenched weak coupling. The new and interesting RHC regions of $&lt;\lambda&gt;\approx 5\times10^{-8}$ and $&lt;\eta&gt;\approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$ are shown to be exclusively explored by measuring both the $\beta\beta $ and $\gamma$ rays associated with the ground and excited DBDs by means of the ton-scale DBD detectors for the IH (inverted hierarchy) $\nu$-masses. The actual RHCs to be studied depend on the RHC NMEs.</description>

      <title>Type-II Seesaw Mechanism for Dirac Neutrinos and its Implications on $N_{\text{eff}}$ and Lepton Flavor Violation in a 3-3-1 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we implement the type-II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrino masses within the framework of a 3-3-1 model. To this end, we introduce a scalar sextet and impose both lepton number conservation and invariance under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry in the Lagrangian. This mechanism naturally generates small Dirac neutrino masses by allowing the soft breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry through a unique term in the scalar potential, while preserving lepton number. Specifically, we explore the realization of this model at low-energy scales. Regarding flavor implications, we analyze its contributions to the rare decay processes $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to \bar e ee$. In the cosmological context, we analyze the influence of right-handed neutrinos on the effective number of neutrino species, $N_\text{eff}$, through interactions mediated by the $Z^{\prime}$ boson. Our findings establish a lower bound of $m_{Z^{\prime}} &gt; 4.4$ TeV, which slightly exceeds the current lower limit set by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation-Based Partial Wave Analysis of $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo simulation-based partial wave analysis of the decay $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ by using the Feynman-Diagram-Calculation framework. The consistency of the input and output parameters implies the reliability of the partial wave analysis method. A robust method of the spin-parity determination of the $\Xi^{*0}$ resonance is introduced. The rejection significance of the alternative spin-parity hypothesis over the favored hypothesis is strong for different spins, but weak for different parities based on the current integrated luminosity of the Belle experiment. Further data collection is needed to improve the sensitivity of parity determination in the future, e.g., Belle II experiment.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscous coefficients of a hot and chirally imbalanced quark matter using NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shear $\eta$ and bulk $\zeta$ viscous coefficients have been calculated in a hot and chirally asymmetric quark matter quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP) using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model. This is done by employing the one-loop Green-Kubo formalism where the viscous coefficients have been extracted from the long-wavelength limit of the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the energy momentum tensor (EMT) current correlator calculated using the real time formalism of finite temperature field theory. The momentum dependent thermal width of the quark/antiquark that enters into the expression of the viscosities as a dynamical input containing interactions, has been obtained from the $2\to2$ scattering processes mediated via the collective mesonic modes in scalar and pseudoscalar chanels encoded in respective in-medium polarization functions having explicit temperature and CCP dependence. Several thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, energy density, entropy density $(s)$, specific heat and isentropic speed of sound have also been calculated at finite CCP. The temperature and CCP dependence of the viscosity to entropy density ratios $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ have also been studied.</description>

      <title>Naturally Resonant Dark Matter from Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the mass resonance structure that naturally arises from extra-dimensional models. The resonance can enhance the dark matter annihilation as well as self-interaction. We demonstrate such a resonance structure by considering the fermionic dark matter and dark photon models on an $S^1/(Z_2 \times Z_2')$ orbifold. We also note that this model embeds dark matter axial vector coupling to the dark photon, which opens up the viable dark matter parameter space. We then present the unique predictions for direct-detection experiments and accelerator searches.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <title>The XLZD Design Book: Towards the Next-Generation Liquid Xenon Observatory for Dark Matter and Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report describes the experimental strategy and technologies for XLZD, the next-generation xenon observatory sensitive to dark matter and neutrino physics. In the baseline design, the detector will have an active liquid xenon target of 60 tonnes, which could be increased to 80 tonnes if the market conditions for xenon are favorable. It is based on the mature liquid xenon time projection chamber technology used in current-generation experiments, LZ and XENONnT. The report discusses the baseline design and opportunities for further optimization of the individual detector components. The experiment envisaged here has the capability to explore parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter down to the neutrino fog, with a 3$\sigma$ evidence potential for WIMP-nucleon cross sections as low as $3\times10^{-49}\rm\,cm^2$ (at 40 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass). The observatory will also have leading sensitivity to a wide range of alternative dark matter models. It is projected to have a 3$\sigma$ observation potential of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe at a half-life of up to $5.7\times 10^{27}$ years. Additionally, it is sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos from the sun and galactic supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the s-wave scattering length in the $0^+$ sector of $\eta_c\eta_c$ and the $2^+$ sector of $J/\psi J/\psi$ using three $N_f=2$ twisted mass gauge ensembles with the lattice spacing $a=0.0667,0.085,0.098$ fm, respectively. The scattering lengths are extracted using the conventional L{\"u}scher finite size method. We observe sizable discretization effects and the results after a continuum extrapolation are $a^{0^+}_{\eta_c\eta_c}=-0.104(09)$ fm and $a^{2^+}_{J/\psi J/\psi}=-0.165(16)$ fm. The slight difference of light quark mass is ignored in this study. Our results indicate that the interaction between the two respective charmonia are repulsive in nature in both cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Expectation Values and Super-Yang-Mills Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. While both experimental observations and numerical simulations have robustly confirmed its existence, the underlying physical mechanism remains elusive. Unraveling the theoretical origin of confinement continues to be a profound and longstanding challenge in both physics and mathematics. Motivated by recent advances in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we investigate the Wilson loop expectation values in the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite chemical potential, employing a holographic approach within the background of an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane. Our results reveal that quantum gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region significantly modify the holographic Wilson loop expectation values. These values exhibit an area-law behavior, indicative of a confining quark-antiquark potential. Within this framework, our findings suggest that confinement in the super-Yang-Mills theory arises as a consequence of near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated relying on the mean-field approximation. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether beyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy could hinder flavor instabilities that are otherwise foreseen. Our results show that these corrections shift the stability regions for a suite of (anti)neutrino ensembles: the flavor conversion of previously unstable distributions can be damped, but angular distributions that are stable in the mean-field case can also become unstable. Our work should serve as a motivation to further investigate the limitations of the mean-field treatment.</description>

      <title>The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced tensor spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to systematically constructing canonical bases for univariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales, which frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The construction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric properties of the curves are simple and explicit, and further kinematic singularities are present as marked points. The simplicity of the normal form facilitates the construction of universal canonical bases with an arbitrary number of marked points, which can be mapped to generic univariate elliptic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation. Therefore, our result can be readily applied to these cases straightforwardly. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, where we show that the $\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector dependence can also be simply done.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>
