      <title>Toward Artificial Open-Ended Evolution within Lenia using Quality-Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the formation of snowflakes to the evolution of diverse life forms, emergence is ubiquitous in our universe. In the quest to understand how complexity can arise from simple rules, abstract computational models, such as cellular automata, have been developed to study self-organization. However, the discovery of self-organizing patterns in artificial systems is challenging and has largely relied on manual or semi-automatic search in the past. In this paper, we show that Quality-Diversity, a family of Evolutionary Algorithms, is an effective framework for the automatic discovery of diverse self-organizing patterns in complex systems. Quality-Diversity algorithms aim to evolve a large population of diverse individuals, each adapted to its ecological niche. Combined with Lenia, a family of continuous cellular automata, we demonstrate that our method is able to evolve a diverse population of lifelike self-organizing autonomous patterns. Our framework, called Leniabreeder, can leverage both manually defined diversity criteria to guide the search toward interesting areas, as well as unsupervised measures of diversity to broaden the scope of discoverable patterns. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that Leniabreeder offers a powerful solution for discovering self-organizing patterns. The effectiveness of unsupervised Quality-Diversity methods combined with the rich landscape of Lenia exhibits a sustained generation of diversity and complexity characteristic of biological evolution. We provide empirical evidence that suggests unbounded diversity and argue that Leniabreeder is a step toward replicating open-ended evolution in silico.</description>

      <title>Offline Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective function with a static dataset and has wide applications. In addition to the objective function being black-box and expensive to evaluate, numerous complex real-world problems entail optimizing multiple conflicting objectives, i.e., multi-objective optimization (MOO). Nevertheless, offline MOO has not progressed as much as offline single-objective optimization (SOO), mainly due to the lack of benchmarks like Design-Bench for SOO. To bridge this gap, we propose a first benchmark for offline MOO, covering a range of problems from synthetic to real-world tasks. This benchmark provides tasks, datasets, and open-source examples, which can serve as a foundation for method comparisons and advancements in offline MOO. Furthermore, we analyze how the current related methods can be adapted to offline MOO from four fundamental perspectives, including data, model architecture, learning algorithm, and search algorithm. Empirical results show improvements over the best value of the training set, demonstrating the effectiveness of offline MOO methods. As no particular method stands out significantly, there is still an open challenge in further enhancing the effectiveness of offline MOO. We finally discuss future challenges for offline MOO, with the hope of shedding some light on this emerging field.

      <title>Quality-Diversity with Limited Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have emerged as a powerful optimization paradigm with the aim of generating a set of high-quality and diverse solutions. To achieve such a challenging goal, QD algorithms require maintaining a large archive and a large population in each iteration, which brings two main issues, sample and resource efficiency. Most advanced QD algorithms focus on improving the sample efficiency, while the resource efficiency is overlooked to some extent. Particularly, the resource overhead during the training process has not been touched yet, hindering the wider application of QD algorithms. In this paper, we highlight this important research question, i.e., how to efficiently train QD algorithms with limited resources, and propose a novel and effective method called RefQD to address it. RefQD decomposes a neural network into representation and decision parts, and shares the representation part with all decision parts in the archive to reduce the resource overhead. It also employs a series of strategies to address the mismatch issue between the old decision parts and the newly updated representation part. Experiments on different types of tasks from small to large resource consumption demonstrate the excellent performance of RefQD: it not only uses significantly fewer resources (e.g., 16\% GPU memories on QDax and 3.7\% on Atari) but also achieves comparable or better performance compared to sample-efficient QD algorithms.

      <title>Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields: A Framework for Solving Time-dependent Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Haptic in-sensor computing device made of carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of haptic in-sensor computing devices has been increasing. In this study, we successfully fabricated a haptic sensor with a hierarchical structure via the sacrificial template method, using carbon nanotubes-polydimethylsiloxane (CNTs-PDMS) nanocomposites for in-sensor computing applications. The CNTs-PDMS nanocomposite sensors, with different sensitivities, were obtained by varying the amount of CNTs. We transformed the input stimuli into higher-dimensional information, enabling a new path for the CNTs-PDMS nanocomposite application, which was implemented on a robotic hand as an in-sensor computing device by applying a reservoir computing paradigm. The nonlinear output data obtained from the sensors were trained using linear regression and used to classify nine different objects used in everyday life with an object recognition accuracy of &gt;80 % for each object. This approach could enable tactile sensation in robots while reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>T-Count Optimizing Genetic Algorithm for Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a crucial process within numerous quantum algorithms, and the need for efficient initialization of quantum registers is ever increasing as demand for useful quantum computing grows. The problem arises as the number of qubits to be initialized grows, the circuits required to implement the desired state also exponentially increase in size leading to loss of fidelity to noise. This is mainly due to the susceptibility to environmental effects of the non-Clifford T gate, whose use should thus be reduced as much as possible. In this paper, we present and utilize a genetic algorithm for state preparation circuits consisting of gates from the Clifford + T gate set and optimize them in T-Count as to reduce the impact of noise. Whilst the method presented here does not always produce the most accurate circuits in terms of fidelity, it can generate high-fidelity, non-trivial quantum states such as quantum Fourier transform states. In addition, our algorithm does automatically generate fault tolerantly implementable solutions where the number of the most error prone components is reduced. We present an evaluation of the algorithm when trialed against preparing random, Poisson probability distribution, W, GHZ, and quantum Fourier transform states. We also experimentally demonstrate the scalability issues as qubit count increases, which highlights the need for further optimization of the search process.</description>

      <title>Multistep Distillation of Diffusion Models via Moment Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for making diffusion models faster to sample. The method distills many-step diffusion models into few-step models by matching conditional expectations of the clean data given noisy data along the sampling trajectory. Our approach extends recently proposed one-step methods to the multi-step case, and provides a new perspective by interpreting these approaches in terms of moment matching. By using up to 8 sampling steps, we obtain distilled models that outperform not only their one-step versions but also their original many-step teacher models, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the Imagenet dataset. We also show promising results on a large text-to-image model where we achieve fast generation of high resolution images directly in image space, without needing autoencoders or upsamplers.</description>

      <title>Element-wise Multiplication Based Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising framework for resolving partial differential equations (PDEs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received widespread attention from industrial and scientific fields. However, lack of expressive ability and initialization pathology issues are found to prevent the application of PINNs in complex PDEs. In this work, we propose Element-wise Multiplication Based Physics-informed Neural Networks (EM-PINNs) to resolve these issues. The element-wise multiplication operation is adopted to transform features into high-dimensional, non-linear spaces, which effectively enhance the expressive capability of PINNs. Benefiting from element-wise multiplication operation, EM-PINNs can eliminate the initialization pathologies of PINNs. The proposed structure is verified on various benchmarks. The results show that EM-PINNs have strong expressive ability.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of surrogate gradient learning in spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training spiking neural networks to approximate complex functions is essential for studying information processing in the brain and neuromorphic computing. Yet, the binary nature of spikes constitutes a challenge for direct gradient-based training. To sidestep this problem, surrogate gradients have proven empirically successful, but their theoretical foundation remains elusive. Here, we investigate the relation of surrogate gradients to two theoretically well-founded approaches. On the one hand, we consider smoothed probabilistic models, which, due to lack of support for automatic differentiation, are impractical for training deep spiking neural networks, yet provide gradients equivalent to surrogate gradients in single neurons. On the other hand, we examine stochastic automatic differentiation, which is compatible with discrete randomness but has never been applied to spiking neural network training. We find that the latter provides the missing theoretical basis for surrogate gradients in stochastic spiking neural networks. We further show that surrogate gradients in deterministic networks correspond to a particular asymptotic case and numerically confirm the effectiveness of surrogate gradients in stochastic multi-layer spiking neural networks. Finally, we illustrate that surrogate gradients are not conservative fields and, thus, not gradients of a surrogate loss. Our work provides the missing theoretical foundation for surrogate gradients and an analytically well-founded solution for end-to-end training of stochastic spiking neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spiking CenterNet: A Distillation-boosted Spiking Neural Network for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of AI at the edge, self-driving cars, and climate change, the need for energy-efficient, small, embedded AI is growing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to address this challenge, with their event-driven information flow and sparse activations. We propose Spiking CenterNet for object detection on event data. It combines an SNN CenterNet adaptation with an efficient M2U-Net-based decoder. Our model significantly outperforms comparable previous work on Prophesee's challenging GEN1 Automotive Detection Dataset while using less than half the energy. Distilling the knowledge of a non-spiking teacher into our SNN further increases performance. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first approach that takes advantage of knowledge distillation in the field of spiking object detection.</description>
