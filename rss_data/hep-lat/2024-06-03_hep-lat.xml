      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>Testing dynamical stabilization of Complex Langevin simulations of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complex Langevin simulations of a toy model as well as QCD, supplemented with a dynamical stabilization (DS) term, which was proposed to regularize the complexified process at lower temperatures. We compare the results to reweghting from zero chemical potential to measure the bias that the inclusion of the stabilization term causes, depending on its strength. At high temperatures the stabilization term is not needed. At low temperatures (below deconfinement transition) the DS term has a beneficial stabilizing effect, but too strong DS term causes phase quenching on the system. We observed that the bias of the dynamical stabilization can be to a good accuracy removed by extrapolating to zero dynamical stabilization force using a sigmoid fit.</description>

      <title>Progress on nucleon transition matrix elements with a lattice QCD variational analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleon weak matrix elements can be extracted from nucleon correlation functions with lattice QCD simulations. The signal-to-noise ratio prohibits the analysis at large source-sink separations and as a consequence, excited state contamination affects the extraction of the nucleon matrix elements. Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) suggests that the dominant contamination in some of these channels is due to $N\pi$ states where the pion carries the same momentum of the current. In this talk, we report updates on the variational analysis with $qqq$-operators (nucleon-like) and $(qqq)(\bar{q}q)$-operators (nucleon-pion-like) where we report for the first time some preliminary results of $\langle N\pi| \mathcal{J}| N \rangle $, modulo some kinematic and volume factors, and we compare the results against ChPT. This pilot study is performed on a CLS ensemble with $N_f=3$, $m_\pi \approx 420~\mathrm{MeV}$, $a\approx 0.1~\mathrm{fm}$ and $T=2L\approx 4.8~\mathrm{fm}$.</description>

      <title>Fate of many-body localization in an Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. We specifically consider an intensive estimator, $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, that acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice being active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ being equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization on many disorder realizations. Analyzing the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ shows that the finite-size estimate of the critical disorder strength, beyond which MBL sets in for thin ladders with $L_y=2$, increases linearly with $L_x$ while the behavior of the full distribution with increasing $L_x$ at fixed $\alpha$ shows that $\alpha_c (L_y=2) &gt;40$, if at all finite, based on data for $L_x \leq 12$. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show their lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased even before MBL sets in. At intermediate and large $\alpha$, but below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, certain randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators dominated by only a few frequencies, reminiscent of oscillations induced by quantum many-body scars.</description>
