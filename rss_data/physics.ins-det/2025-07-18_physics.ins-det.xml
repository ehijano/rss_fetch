      <title>Extended thermal cycling of ATLAS ITk strip modules with and without stress mitigating interposers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates critical mechanical failures during stand-alone thermocycling of ATLAS Inner Tracker strip pre-production modules. Five modules undergo extended thermocycling after adequately levelling thermal chucks and introducing interlocks for unattended operation. Module bow evolution is tracked via regular sensor metrology. All five modules exhibit bow increases with a mean of $146\pm 27~\mu$m when raising maximum cycling temperatures from $20^\circ$C to $40^\circ$C. Four such modules exhibit sensor fractures when cycled to $-44^\circ$C. A stress-mitigating layer of silicone gel and Kapton film interposer is introduced to three further modules, with detailed quality control data establishing electromechanical viability. No significant bow change of $1\pm 10~\mu$m is observed after ten cycles between $[+40, -44]^\circ$C relative to $[+20, -44]^\circ$C. Two interposer modules undergo 200 thermocycles up to $[+56, -44]^\circ$C without fracturing. This decreased sensor deformation and fracturing is interpreted as evidence for reduced thermal stress.</description>

      <title>Space-based mm/mg-scale Laser Interferometer for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <title>Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.</description>

      <title>Towards Underwater Detection of Diluted Bitumen with Interdigital Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diluted bitumen spills in freshwater environments pose significant challenges for detection and remediation due to the complex behaviour of the material once released, rendering traditional oil monitoring techniques, such as aerial surveys and fluorometry, ineffective. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing interdigital capacitive sensors to detect dilbit in water via frequency-dependent impedance measurements. Three sensor designs were fabricated and tested with a vector network analyzer across samples with varying dilbit concentrations. All sensor designs detected electrical changes, exhibiting linear regions and strong potential for quantitative sensing. These findings support the integration of the sensors into autonomous underwater robotic platforms for real-time, distributed monitoring of dilbit spills in freshwater systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Simplified Model for Planar Capacitors up to 1 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study and modelling of planar capacitors remain highly relevant due to their broad applications. However, their accurate modelling presents significant challenges due to intrinsic high-frequency effects, which include not only parasitic inductance but also ohmic losses in the copper and dielectric losses in the substrate. Therefore, this work proposes developing a new simplified planar capacitor model consisting of two identical rectangular plates, which incorporates the effects of both the substrate and the medium between the conductor traces on the total capacitance. Moreover, it includes the impact of parasitic inductance and losses associated with the copper and substrate. This study demonstrated the importance of modelling both the dielectric substrate and the inter-conductor medium, with results showing significant improvements in the proposed model's accuracy. Experimental validation through comparison with an already established model in the literature and physical planar capacitors revealed good agreement for most cases studied.</description>

      <title>Accurate, precise pressure sensing with tethered optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that optomechanical pressure sensors with characterized density and thickness can achieve uncertainty as low as 1.1 % via comparison with a secondary pressure standard. The agreement between the secondary standard and our optomechanical sensors is a necessary step towards using optomechanical devices as primary pressure sensors. Our silicon nitride and silicon carbide sensors are short-term and long-term stable, displaying Allan deviations compatible with better than 1 % precision and baseline drift significantly lower than the secondary standard. Our measurements also yield the in situ thin-film density of our sensors with 1 % total uncertainty or lower, aiding development of other optomechanical sensors. Our results demonstrate that optomechanical pressure sensors can achieve accuracy, precision, and drift sufficient to replace high performance legacy pressure gauges.</description>
