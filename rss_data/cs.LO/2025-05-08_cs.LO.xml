      <title>Proceedings The 13th International Workshop on Theorem proving components for Educational software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies.  What follows is a brief description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.  The 13th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software (ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy, France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad (Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the 30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th - August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.

      <title>Being polite is not enough (and other limits of theory combination)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Nelson-Oppen combination method for satisfiability modulo theories, the combined theories must be stably infinite; in gentle combination, one theory has to be gentle, and the other has to satisfy a similar yet weaker property; in shiny combination, only one has to be shiny (smooth, with a computable minimal model function and the finite model property); and for polite combination, only one has to be strongly polite (smooth and strongly finitely witnessable). For each combination method, we prove that if any of its assumptions are removed, then there is no general method to combine an arbitrary pair of theories satisfying the remaining assumptions. We also prove new theory combination results that weaken the assumptions of gentle and shiny combination.</description>

      <title>The calculus of neo-Peircean relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculus of relations was introduced by De Morgan and Peirce during the second half of the 19th century. Later developments on quantification theory by Frege and Peirce himself, paved the way to what is known today as first-order logic, causing the calculus of relations to be long forgotten. This was until 1941, when Tarski raised the question on the existence of a complete axiomatisation for it. This question found only negative answers: there is no finite axiomatisation for the calculus of relations and many of its fragments, as shown later by several no-go theorems. In this paper we show that -- by moving from traditional syntax (cartesian) to a diagrammatic one (monoidal) -- it is possible to have complete axiomatisations for the full calculus. The no-go theorems are circumvented by the fact that our calculus, named the calculus of neo-Peircean relations, is more expressive than the calculus of relations and, actually, as expressive as first-order logic. The axioms are obtained by combining two well known categorical structures: cartesian and linear bicategories.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Verifying Neuronal Archetypes in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification has become increasingly important because of the kinds of guarantees that it can provide for software systems. Verification of models of biological and medical systems is a promising application of formal verification. Human neural networks have recently been emulated and studied as a biological system. In this paper, we provide a model of some crucial neuronal circuits, called "archetypes", in the Coq Proof Assistant and prove properties concerning their dynamic behavior. Understanding the behavior of these modules is crucial because they constitute the elementary building blocks of bigger neuronal circuits. We consider seven fundamental archetypes (simple series, series with multiple outputs, parallel composition, positive loop, negative loop, inhibition of a behavior, and contralateral inhibition), and prove an important representative property for six of them. In building up to our model of archetypes, we also provide a general model of "neuronal circuits", and prove a variety of general properties about neurons and circuits. In addition, we have defined our model with a longer term goal of modelling the composition of basic archetypes into larger networks, and structured our libraries with definitions and lemmas useful for proving the properties in this paper as well as those to be proved as future work.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact and Student Perceptions of Guided Parsons Problems for Learning Logic with Subgoals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parsons problems (PPs) have shown promise in structured problem solving by providing scaffolding that decomposes the problem and requires learners to reconstruct the solution. However, some students face difficulties when first learning with PPs or solving more complex Parsons problems. This study introduces Guided Parsons problems (GPPs) designed to provide step-specific hints and improve learning outcomes in an intelligent logic tutor. In a controlled experiment with 76 participants, GPP students achieved significantly higher accuracy of rule application in both level-end tests and post-tests, with the strongest gains among students with lower prior knowledge. GPP students initially spent more time in training (1.52 vs. 0.81 hours) but required less time for post-tests, indicating improved problem solving efficiency. Our thematic analysis of GPP student self-explanations revealed task decomposition, better rule understanding, and reduced difficulty as key themes, while some students felt the structured nature of GPPs restricted their own way of reasoning. These findings reinforce that GPPs can effectively combine the benefits of worked examples and problem solving practice, but could be further improved by individual adaptation.</description>

      <title>The Church Synthesis Problem over Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Church Problem asks for the construction of a procedure which, given a logical specification A(I,O) between input omega-strings I and output omega-strings O, determines whether there exists an operator F that implements the specification in the sense that A(I, F(I)) holds for all inputs I. Buchi and Landweber provided a procedure to solve the Church problem for MSO specifications and operators computable by finite-state automata. We investigate a generalization of the Church synthesis problem to the continuous time domain of the non-negative reals.
  We show that in the continuous time domain there are phenomena which are very different from the canonical discrete time domain of the natural numbers.</description>

      <title>Hofmann-Streicher lifting of fibred categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1997, Hofmann and Streicher introduced an explicit construction to lift a Grothendieck universe $\mathcal{U}$ from $\mathbf{Set}$ into the category of $\mathbf{Set}$-valued presheaves on a $\mathcal{U}$-small category $B$. More recently, Awodey presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the categorical nerve, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, the categorical nerve's functorial action on the universal $\mathcal{U}$-small discrete fibration gives the generic family of $\mathcal{U}$'s Hofmann-Streicher lifting. Inspired by Awodey's analysis, we define a relative version of Hofmann-Streicher lifting in terms of the right pseudo-adjoint to the 2-functor $\mathbf{Fib}_{A}\to\mathbf{Fib}_{B}$ given by postcomposition with a fibration $p\colon A\to B$.</description>
