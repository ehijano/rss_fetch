      <title>Modes of convergence of sequences of holomorphic functions: a linear point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, pointwise convergence, uniform convergence and compact convergence of sequences of holomorphic functions on an open subset of the complex plane are compared from a linear point of view. In fact, it is proved the existence of large linear algebras consisting, except for zero, of sequences of holomorphic functions tending to zero compactly but not uniformly on the open set or of sequences of holomorphic functions tending pointwisely to zero but not compactly. Also dense linear subspaces in an appropriate Fr\'echet space as well as infinite dimensional Banach spaces of sequences converging to zero in the mentioned modes are shown to exist.</description>

      <title>Cubic polynomials with a 2-cycle of Siegel disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under conjugation by affine transformations, the dynamical moduli space of cubic polynomials $f$ with a $2$-cycle of Siegel disks is parameterized by a three-punctured complex plane as a degree-$2$ cover. Assuming the rotation number of $f^2$ on the Siegel disk is of bounded type, we show that on the three-punctured complex plane, the locus of the cubic polynomials with both finite critical points on the boundaries of the Siegel disks on the $2$-cycle is comprised of two arcs, corresponding to the cases with two critical points on the boundary of the same Siegel disk, and a Jordan curve, corresponding to the cases with two critical points on the boundaries of different Siegel disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noguchi proved that the set of dominant maps from a fixed variety to a fixed hyperbolic variety is finite. We extend this result to the setting of orbifold pairs, as introduced by Campana, under suitable assumptions. Certain compactness properties also allow us to prove that the set of orbifold pointed maps and the orbifold automorphism group are finite.</description>

      <title>On the field of meromorphic functions on a Stein surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that fields of meromorphic functions on Stein surfaces have cohomological dimension 2, and solve the period-index problem and Serre's conjecture II for these fields. We obtain analogous results for fields of real meromorphic functions on Stein surfaces equipped with an antiholomorphic involution. We deduce an optimal quantitative solution to Hilbert's 17th problem on analytic surfaces.</description>

      <title>The isomorphism problem for analytic discs with self-crossings on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $V$ is the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ embedded in the $d$-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}_d$ and attached to the unit sphere. Consider the space $\mathcal{H}_V$, the restriction of the Drury-Arveson space to the variety $V$, and its multiplier algebra $\mathcal{M}_V = \operatorname{Mult}(\mathcal{H}_V)$. The isomorphism problem is the following: Is $V_1 \cong V_2$ equivalent to $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$?
  A theorem of Alpay, Putinar and Vinnikov states that for $V$ without self-crossings on the boundary $\mathcal{M}_V$ is the space of bounded analytic functions on $V$. We consider what happens when there are self-crossings on the boundary and prove that if $\mathcal{M}_{V_1} \cong \mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ algebraically, then $V_1$ and $V_2$ must have the same self-crossings up to a unit disc automorphism. We prove that an isomorphism between $\mathcal{M}_{V_1}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{V_2}$ can only be given by a composition with a map from $V_1$ to $V_2$. In the case of a single simple self-crossing we show that there are only two possible candidates for this map and find these candidates. Finally, we provide a continuum of $V$'s with the same self-crossing pattern such that their multiplier algebras are all mutually non-isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of periodic dimer models and generalized discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the algebraic equation for arctic curves of the Aztec diamond with a doubly (quasi-)periodic weight structure and obtain similar results for certain models of the hexagon. In particular, we determine the algebraic degree of such curves as a function of the number of frozen and smooth (or gaseous) regions. The key to our result is the construction of a discriminant for meromorphic differentials on a higher genus Riemann surface. This construction works analogously for meromorphic sections of arbitrary holomorphic line bundles. In the genus $g = 0$ case this notion reduces to the usual discriminant of a polynomial.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Resurgence of WKB Solutions of Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that formal WKB solutions of Schr\"odinger equations on Riemann surfaces are resurgent. Specifically, they are Borel summable in almost all directions and their Borel transforms admit endless analytic continuation away from a discrete subset of singularities. Our approach is purely geometric, relying on understanding the global geometry of complex flows of meromorphic vector fields using techniques from holomorphic Lie groupoids and the geometry of spectral curves. This framework provides a fully geometric description of the Borel plane, Borel singularities, and the Stokes rays. In doing so, we introduce a geometric perspective on resurgence theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that every stable manifold arising from a holomorphic automorphism, that acts hyperbolically on a compact invariant set, is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space. Such stable manifolds are known to be biholomorphic to the basin of a uniformly attracting family of holomorphic maps. It is shown that the basin of a uniformly attracting family of holomorphic maps is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space and this resolves the conjecture on the biholomorphism type of such stable manifolds affirmatively.</description>

      <title>The Hardy number and the Bergman number of a planar domain are equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with functions with a prefixed range and their inclusion in Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. This idea was originally introduced by Hansen for Hardy spaces, and it was recently taken into weighted Bergman spaces by Karafyllia and Karamanlis. In particular, we improve a theorem of Karafyllia showing that the Hardy and Bergman numbers of any given domain coincide, that is, the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces to which a function with prefixed range belongs can be related. The main tools in the proofs are the Green function of the domain and its universal covering map.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Theory on Complete K\"ahler Connected Sums With Non-parabolic Ends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by invalidness of Liouville property for harmonic functions on the connected sum $\#^\vartheta\mathbb C^m$ with $\vartheta\geq2,$ we study Nevanlinna theory on a complete K\"ahler connected sum
  $$M=M_1\#\cdots\# M_\vartheta$$ with $\vartheta$ non-parabolic ends. Based on the global Green function method, we extend the second main theorem of meromorphic mappings to $M.$ As a consequence, we obtain a Picard's little theorem provided that all $M_j^,s$ have non-negative Ricci curvature, which states that every meromorphic function on $M$ reduces to a constant if it omits three distinct values.In particular, it implies that Cauchy-Riemann equation supports a rigidity of Liouville property as an invariant under connected sums.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>
