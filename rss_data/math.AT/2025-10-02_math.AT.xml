      <title>Monodromy of supersolvable toric arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological aspects of supersolvable abelian arrangements, toric arrangements in particular. The complement of such an arrangement sits atop a tower of fiber bundles, and we investigate the relationship between these bundles and bundles involving classical configuration spaces. In the toric case, we show that the monodromy of a supersolvable arrangement bundle factors through the Artin braid group, and that of a strictly supersolvable arrangement bundle factors further through the Artin pure braid group. The latter factorization is particularly informative -- we use it to determine a number of invariants of the complement of a strictly supersolvable arrangement, including the cohomology ring and the lower central series Lie algebra of the fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Representation asymptotics in the homology of pure graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit formulas for the asymptotic Betti numbers, over an arbitrary field, of the ordered configuration spaces of a graph. In characteristic zero, we further give explicit formulas for the asymptotic multiplicities in homology of many irreducible representations of the symmetric group, in the spirit of representation stability.</description>

      <title>The spectral Sullivan conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any map from an infinite loop space to a $p$-complete nilpotent finite dimensional space factors canonically through a union of $p$-adic tori. This is proven via bootstrapping from the case of $B\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, which is the key case of the Sullivan conjecture proven by Miller. The main step in our proof is to show that the subcategory of spectra generated by the reduced suspension spectrum of $B\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ under colimits and extensions agrees with that of a Moore spectrum.</description>

      <title>Classification for smooth manifolds looking like $\mathbb{CP}^3\times S^7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify simply connected closed smooth $13$-dimensional manifolds whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of $\mb{CP}^3\times S^7$, up to diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, and homotopy equivalence. Furthermore, if such a manifold satisfies certain conditions, either itself or its connected sum with an exotic $13$-sphere $\Sigma^{13}$ admits a Riemannian metric of non-negative sectional curvature. As an additional application of our classification, we classify the diagonal $S^1$-actions on $S^7\times S^7$.</description>

      <title>Comparing dg category models for path spaces via $A_\infty$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a many-object dual version of Chen's iterated integral map. For any topological space X, the construction takes the form of an A-infinity functor between two dg categories whose objects are the points of X: the domain has as morphisms the singular (cubical) chains on the space of (Moore) paths in X and the codomain has morphisms arising by totalizing a cosimplicial chain complex determined by the dg coalgebra of singular (simplicial) chains in X. When X is simply connected, we show this construction defines a homotopy inverse to a classical map of Adams, which sends ordered sequences of singular simplices in X linked by shared vertices to cubes of paths in X. When X is not necessarily simply connected, following an idea of Irie, we incorporate the fundamental groupoid of X into the construction and deduce analogous results. Along the way, we provide an elementary and new proof of the fact that the (direct-sum) cobar construction of the chains in X, suitably interpreted, models the dg category of paths in X, an extension of Adams's cobar theorem established by Rivera-Zeinalian using different methods.</description>

      <title>Volumes of Nullhomotopies in Nilpotent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shadowing Principle of Manin has proved a valuable tool for addressing questions of quantitative topology raised by Gromov in the late 1900s. The principle informally provides a way for bounded algebraic maps between differential graded algebras to be translated into nearby genuine maps between their geometric realizations. We extend this principle to finite towers of principal $K(G,n)$ fibrations, and in particular apply this construction to nilpotent spaces. As a specific application of the extended principle, we provide upper bounds on the asymptotic behavior of volumes of nullhomotopies of Lipschitz maps into nilpotent spaces. We further refine these bounds in the case when $c = 1$ to nearly meet those of the simply connected setting. We similarly refine these bounds in the event the target space is coformal, and demonstrate that the bounds in this setting are nearly sharp.</description>

      <title>The mapping class group invariants of the truncated group ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the invariant subspace of the rational group ring of a surface, truncated by powers of the augmentation ideal, under the action of the mapping class group. The surface is compact, oriented with one boundary component. This provides the first group cohomology computation for the mapping class group with non-symplectic coefficients since Kawazumi-Souli\'e. Our computation is valid in a range growing with the genus.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for Hurwitz spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the homology of the Hurwitz space associated to an arbitrary finite rack stabilizes integrally in a suitable sense. We also compute the dominant part of its stable homology after inverting finitely many primes. This proves a conjecture of Ellenberg--Venkatesh--Westerland and improves upon our previous results for non-splitting racks. We obtain applications to Malle's conjecture, the Picard rank conjecture, and the Cohen--Lenstra--Martinet heuristics.</description>

      <title>On the attaching map of the 3-cell skeleton of the homotopy fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\in\pi_{n+k}(S^{n})$, ($n\geq2$ and $k\geq0$) and let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of the pinch map $\s C_{f}=S^{n+1}\cup e^{n+k+2} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$, (in the case $k=0$, further suppose that $\s C_{f}\not\simeq*$). Assume that we wish to compute the $p$-primary component of $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ which is possibly far unstable, where $p$ is a prime different from 3. As a type of Gray's relative James constructions, it is known that the homotopy fibre $ F$ has a CW decomposition $F=(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})\cup_{\beta} e^{3n+2k+3}\cup \cdots$, where $\af=[1_{S^{n+1}},\s f]\in\pi_{n+k+1}(S^{n})$ is the Whitehead product and $\beta$ is a higher Whitehead product. However, higher Whitehead products are intricate and difficult to manage in general. In this paper, by use of Selick-Wu's $\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{min}}$-theory together with the machinery of Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences, we show that in the 2-local case, the attaching map $\beta\in \pi_{3n+2k+2}(S^{n+1}\cup_{\af} e^{2n+k+2})$ is decomposed to be $\s^{2n+k+2}f$ composing with a certain inclusion map; in the $p$-local case, where $p\geq5$ and $n+k$ is odd, the attaching map $\beta$ admits a similar decomposition. By this, we are able to calculate the $p$-primary components of the possibly far unstable homotopy groups $\pi_{*}(\Sigma C_{f})$ via the homoptopy fibration $F\rightarrow \Sigma C_{f} \rightarrow S^{n+k+2}$ in the range requiring the 3-cell skeleton of $F$, if the involved homotopy groups of spheres are known; (if $p\geq5$ further assume that $n+k$ is odd). As an application, we determine the 2-primary component of the far unstable homotopy group $\pi_{18}(\Sigma ^{3}\mathbb{C}P^{2})$.</description>

      <title>The Cohen--Lenstra moments over function fields via the stable homology of non-splitting Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</description>

      <title>Spectral equivalence of nearby Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring spectrum. We construct the wrapped Donaldson--Fukaya category with coefficients in $R$ of any stably polarized Liouville sector. We show that any two $R$-orientable and isomorphic objects admit $R$-orientations so that their $R$-fundamental classes coincide. Our main result is that any closed exact Lagrangian $R$-brane in the cotangent bundle of a closed manifold is isomorphic to an $R$-brane structure on the zero section in the wrapped Donaldson--Fukaya category, generalizing a well-known result over the integers. To achieve this, we prove that the Floer homotopy type of the cotangent fiber is given by the stable homotopy type of the based loop space of the zero section.</description>
