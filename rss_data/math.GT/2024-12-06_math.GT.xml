      <title>Geometry and topology of closed geodesics complements in the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for at most three closed geodesics with linearly independent directions, the homeomorphism type of its complement in the 3-torus is determine by the orbit of their direction vectors subspaces under the action of $\PSL_3(\mathbb{Z}).$ Moreover, we provide asymptotically sharp volume bounds for a family of closed geodesics complements. The bounds depend only on the distance in the Farey graph.</description>

      <title>Twisted right-angled Artin groups embedded in knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted right-angled Artin groups are defined through presentation based on mixed graphs. Each vertex corresponds to a generator, each undirected edge yields a commuting relation and each directed edge gives a Klein bottle relation. If there is no directed edge, then this reduces to an ordinary right-angled Artin group.
  There is a characterization of right-angled Artin groups which can be embedded in knot groups by Katayama. In this paper, we completely determine twisted right-angled Artin groups embedded in knot groups.</description>

      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph is aiming to serve as a primary introduction to spectral networks, by presenting them and their many applications from the scope of geometry and mathematical physics in a unified way. We do not attempt to treat these two approaches separately but rather provide broad motivation and the necessary background to reach to the frontiers of this fast-evolving field of research, explaining simultaneously the relevant geometric and physical aspects. The targeted audience is researchers and advanced students from either a rather mathematical or physical oriented education who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a new way of their construction.
  We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. They are essentially so-called Reeb graphs of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation). Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of a dissection. In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces. We reduce the problem to the analysis of a discrete graph structure representing the correspondence between the edges and vertices of the pieces forming each polygon, using ideas from common unfolding.</description>

      <title>The Habiro ring of a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group. We prove that the perturbative Chern-Simons invariants of knots and 3-manifolds are elements of these modules and identify these elements with expansions of certain admissible series of Kontsevich-Soibelman at roots of unity, suggesting that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.</description>

      <title>Non-arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds attached to unitary Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method of constructing non-arithmetic lattices in the projective orthogonal group $\text{PO}(n,1)$ for every integer $n$ larger than one. The technique is to consider anti-holomorphic involutions on a complex arithmetic ball quotient, glue their fixed loci along geodesic subspaces, and show that the resulting metric space carries canonically the structure of a complete real hyperbolic orbifold. The volume of various of these non-arithmetic orbifolds can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>The Powell Conjecture for the genus-three Heegaard splitting of the $3$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Powell Conjecture states that the Goeritz group of the Heegaard splitting of the $3$-sphere is finitely generated; furthermore, four specific elements suffice to generate the group. Zupan demonstrated that the conjecture holds if and only if the reducing sphere complexes are all connected. In this work, we establish the connectivity of the reducing sphere complex for the genus-$3$ case, thereby confirming the Powell Conjecture in genus $3$. Additionally, we propose a potential framework for extending this approach to Heegaard splittings of higher genera.</description>

      <title>On the weak reducing pairs in critical Heegaard splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weak reducing pair in a Heegaard splitting M = V \cup_S W is a pair of disjoint essential disks D \in V and E \in W. The weakly reducible Heegaard splitting contains at least one weak reducing pair. Critical Heegaard splitting is a special case of weakly reducible Heegaard splitting which contains at least two weak reducing pairs satisfying some special conditions. In this paper, we discuss the properties of weak reducing pairs in a critical Heegaard splitting and give a necessary condition for Heegaard surface to be critical.</description>

      <title>Surface Quotients of Right-Angled Hyperbolic Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic buildings are central objects in both hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, exhibiting a wide range of intriguing characteristics, especially with respect to group actions. In this paper, we develop the theory of surface quotients of Fuchsian buildings. For a large family of Fuchsian buildings, we prove the existence of a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of the automorphism group of the Fuchsian building whose quotient is a compact surface without boundary. We also provide some necessary conditions for the existence of such lattices, in terms of the symmetries of the building. The proof is based on another result of ours that generators of the fundamental group of a tessellated surface can be chose by closed geodesics in the 1-skeleton of the tessellation, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>
