      <title>A braidoid equivalence for spherical knotoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Braidoids form a counterpart theory to the theory of planar knotoids, just as braids do for three-dimensional links. As such, planar knotoid diagrams represent the same knotoid in $\mathbb{R}^2$ if and only if they can be presented as the closure of two labeled braidoid diagrams related by an equivalence relation, named $L$-equivalence. In this paper, we refine the notion of $L$-equivalence of braidoid diagrams in order to obtain an equivalence theorem for (multi)-knotoid diagrams in $S^2$ when represented as the closure of labeled braidoid diagrams.</description>

      <title>Mixed-platonic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that we call mixed-platonic, composed of regular ideal hyperbolic polyhedra of more than one type, which includes certain previously-known examples. We establish basic facts about mixed-platonic manifolds which allow us to conclude, among other things, that there is no mixed-platonic hyperbolic knot complement with hidden symmetries.</description>

      <title>On Foliations in $\text{PSL}(4,\mathbb{R})$-Teichm\"uller Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed study of the structure of domains of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho$ in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ of $\text{PSL}_4(\mathbb{R})$-Hitchin representations $\rho$. We then prove the foliated component $\Omega_\rho^1$ of $\Omega_\rho$ has exactly two group-invariant foliations by properly embedded projective line segments and has a unique foliation by properly embedded convex domains in projective planes. This gives a finiteness counterpart to work of Guichard and Wienhard. We also prove analogues for the non-foliated component $\Omega_\rho^2$ and deduce a rigidity of projective equivalences of properly convex foliated projective structures on unit tangent bundles of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Growth tightness and genericity for word metrics from injective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping class groups are known to admit geometric (proper, cobounded) actions on injective spaces. Starting with such an action, and relying only on geometric arguments, we show that all finite generating sets resulting from taking large enough balls (as in the \v{S}varc-Milnor lemma) in the respective injective space yield word metrics where pseudo-Anosov maps are exponentially generic. We also show that growth tightness holds true for the Cayley graphs corresponding to these finite generating sets, providing a positive answer to a question by Arzhantseva, Cashen and Tao, who asked if any of the mapping class group's Cayley graphs is growth tight. To achieve the above results, we consider the space of all geometric actions of a mapping class group, and for any injective metric space in this collection, we construct a sequence of word metrics that converges to it and show that all large enough terms of the converging sequence inherit many desirable properties from the limiting injective space.</description>

      <title>Deformations of curves with constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that curves of constant curvature satisfy the parametric $C^1$-dense relative $h$-principle in the space of immersed curves with nonvanishing curvature in Euclidean space $R^{n\geq 3}$. It follows that two knots of constant curvature in $R^3$ are isotopic, resp. homotopic, through curves of constant curvature if and only if they are isotopic, resp. homotopic, and their self-linking numbers, resp. self-linking numbers mod $2$, are equal.</description>

      <title>Generalized foliations for homeomorphisms isotopic to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism: a geometric realization of a result by Fathi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a result by Fathi, which states that, to any homeomorphism of a closed surface which is isotopic to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism, we can associate a stable and an unstable invariant partition of the surface with properties which are similar to the unstable and the stable foliation of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Multiplicities in the length spectrum and growth rate of Salem numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that mean multiplicities in the length spectrum of a non-compact arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold of dimension $n \geqslant 4$ have exponential growth rate $$ \langle g(L) \rangle \geqslant c \frac{e^{([n/2] - 1)L}}{L^{1 + \delta_{5, 7}(n) }}, $$ extending the analogous result for even dimensions of Belolipetsky, Lal\'in, Murillo and Thompson. Our proof is based on the study of (square-rootable) Salem numbers.
  As a counterpart, we also prove an asymptotic formula for the distribution of square-rootable Salem numbers by adapting the argument of G\"otze and Gusakova. It shows that one can not obtain a better estimate on mean multiplicities using our approach.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Morse Theory and Witten Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups with planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a version of Martin and Skora's conjecture that convergence groups on the $2$-sphere are covered by Kleinian groups. Given a relatively hyperbolic group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ with planar boundary and no Sierpinski carpet or cut points in its boundary, and with $G$ one ended and virtually having no $2$-torsion, we show that $G$ is virtually Kleinian. We also give applications to various versions of the Cannon conjecture and to convergence groups acting on $S^2$.</description>
