      <title>Mesh Simplification For Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational approach for unfolding 3D shapes isometrically into the plane as a single patch without overlapping triangles. This is a hard, sometimes impossible, problem, which existing methods are forced to soften by allowing for map distortions or multiple patches. Instead, we propose a geometric relaxation of the problem: we modify the input shape until it admits an overlap-free unfolding. We achieve this by locally displacing vertices and collapsing edges, guided by the unfolding process. We validate our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively on a large dataset of complex shapes and show its proficiency by fabricating real shapes from paper.</description>

      <title>HiRegEx: Interactive Visual Query and Exploration of Multivariate Hierarchical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using exploratory visual analysis to examine multivariate hierarchical data, users often need to query data to narrow down the scope of analysis. However, formulating effective query expressions remains a challenge for multivariate hierarchical data, particularly when datasets become very large. To address this issue, we develop a declarative grammar, HiRegEx (Hierarchical data Regular Expression), for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data. Rooted in the extended multi-level task topology framework for tree visualizations (e-MLTT), HiRegEx delineates three query targets (node, path, and subtree) and two aspects for querying these targets (features and positions), and uses operators developed based on classical regular expressions for query construction. Based on the HiRegEx grammar, we develop an exploratory framework for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data and integrate it into the TreeQueryER prototype system. The exploratory framework includes three major components: top-down pattern specification, bottom-up data-driven inquiry, and context-creation data overview. We validate the expressiveness of HiRegEx with the tasks from the e-MLTT framework and showcase the utility and effectiveness of TreeQueryER system through a case study involving expert users in the analysis of a citation tree dataset.</description>

      <title>Potamoi: Accelerating Neural Rendering via a Unified Streaming Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a promising alternative for photorealistic rendering. Despite recent algorithmic advancements, achieving real-time performance on today's resource-constrained devices remains challenging. In this paper, we identify the primary bottlenecks in current NeRF algorithms and introduce a unified algorithm-architecture co-design, Potamoi, designed to accommodate various NeRF algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a runtime system featuring a plug-and-play algorithm, SpaRW, which significantly reduces the per-frame computational workload and alleviates compute inefficiencies. Furthermore, our unified streaming pipeline coupled with customized hardware support effectively tames both SRAM and DRAM inefficiencies by minimizing repetitive DRAM access and completely eliminating SRAM bank conflicts. When evaluated against a baseline utilizing a dedicated DNN accelerator, our framework demonstrates a speed-up and energy reduction of 53.1$\times$ and 67.7$\times$, respectively, all while maintaining high visual quality with less than a 1.0 dB reduction in peak signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>PBIR-NIE: Glossy Object Capture under Non-Distant Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glossy objects present a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction from multi-view input images under natural lighting. In this paper, we introduce PBIR-NIE, an inverse rendering framework designed to holistically capture the geometry, material attributes, and surrounding illumination of such objects. We propose a novel parallax-aware non-distant environment map as a lightweight and efficient lighting representation, accurately modeling the near-field background of the scene, which is commonly encountered in real-world capture setups. This feature allows our framework to accommodate complex parallax effects beyond the capabilities of standard infinite-distance environment maps. Our method optimizes an underlying signed distance field (SDF) through physics-based differentiable rendering, seamlessly connecting surface gradients between a triangle mesh and the SDF via neural implicit evolution (NIE). To address the intricacies of highly glossy BRDFs in differentiable rendering, we integrate the antithetic sampling algorithm to mitigate variance in the Monte Carlo gradient estimator. Consequently, our framework exhibits robust capabilities in handling glossy object reconstruction, showcasing superior quality in geometry, relighting, and material estimation.</description>

      <title>SpectralGaussians: Semantic, spectral 3D Gaussian splatting for multi-spectral scene representation, visualization and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cross-spectral rendering framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that generates realistic and semantically meaningful splats from registered multi-view spectrum and segmentation maps. This extension enhances the representation of scenes with multiple spectra, providing insights into the underlying materials and segmentation. We introduce an improved physically-based rendering approach for Gaussian splats, estimating reflectance and lights per spectra, thereby enhancing accuracy and realism. In a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach with respect to other recent learning-based spectral scene representation approaches (i.e., XNeRF and SpectralNeRF) as well as other non-spectral state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Our work also demonstrates the potential of spectral scene understanding for precise scene editing techniques like style transfer, inpainting, and removal. Thereby, our contributions address challenges in multi-spectral scene representation, rendering, and editing, offering new possibilities for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Content and Style Aware Audio-Driven Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07005v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has several virtual humans applications for content creation and editing. While several existing methods provide solutions for speech-driven animation, precise control over content (what) and style (how) of the final performance is still challenging. We propose a novel approach that takes as input an audio, and the corresponding text to extract temporally-aligned content and disentangled style representations, in order to provide controls over 3D facial animation. Our method is trained in two stages, that evolves from audio prominent styles (how it sounds) to visual prominent styles (how it looks). We leverage a high-resource audio dataset in stage I to learn styles that control speech generation in a self-supervised learning framework, and then fine-tune this model with low-resource audio/3D mesh pairs in stage II to control 3D vertex generation. We employ a non-autoregressive seq2seq formulation to model sentence-level dependencies, and better mouth articulations. Our method provides flexibility that the style of a reference audio and the content of a source audio can be combined to enable audio style transfer. Similarly, the content can be modified, e.g. muting or swapping words, that enables style-preserving content editing.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Meshlet Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a codec specifically designed for meshlet compression, optimized for rapid data-parallel GPU decompression within a mesh shader. Our compression strategy orders triangles in optimal generalized triangle strips (GTSs), which we generate by formulating the creation as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Our method achieves index buffer compression rates of 16:1 compared to the vertex pipeline and crack-free vertex attribute quantization based on user preference. The 15.5 million triangles of our teaser image decompress and render in 0.59 ms on an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.</description>

      <title>GarmentCodeData: A Dataset of 3D Made-to-Measure Garments With Sewing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research interest in the learning-based processing of garments, from virtual fitting to generation and reconstruction, stumbles on a scarcity of high-quality public data in the domain. We contribute to resolving this need by presenting the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D made-to-measure garments with sewing patterns, as well as its generation pipeline. GarmentCodeData contains 115,000 data points that cover a variety of designs in many common garment categories: tops, shirts, dresses, jumpsuits, skirts, pants, etc., fitted to a variety of body shapes sampled from a custom statistical body model based on CAESAR, as well as a standard reference body shape, applying three different textile materials. To enable the creation of datasets of such complexity, we introduce a set of algorithms for automatically taking tailor's measures on sampled body shapes, sampling strategies for sewing pattern design, and propose an automatic, open-source 3D garment draping pipeline based on a fast XPBD simulator, while contributing several solutions for collision resolution and drape correctness to enable scalability.

      <title>A Practical Solver for Scalar Data Topological Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</description>
