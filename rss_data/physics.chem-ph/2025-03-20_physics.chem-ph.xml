      <title>Comparison between PBE-D3, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3 and MP2 Methods for quantum mechanical calculations of polarizability and IR-NMR spectra in C24 isomers, including a novel isomer with D2d symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive theoretical analysis of C24 isomers in the gaseous phase using the PBE-D3-cc-pVTZ,B3LYP-cc-pVTZ,B3LYP-D3-cc-pVTZ , MP2-6-31G methods.We consider the basis set cc-pVTZ for the MP2 method , carry out optimized (single point) calculations in three isomers (remaining two isomers when convergence was too time consuming) in order to reveal the potentiality of the method.We covered many properties,including geometry optimizations,chemical stability,polarizabilities,nuclear screening constants,Fermi(FE),gap(GE) , atomization energies(AE),thermodynamic analysis,reactivity index,IR, NMR.Calculations were performed for ring (D12h), sheet (D6h) , two cage (D6d,Oh) configurations. We proposed a new structure, the bracelet (D2d) arrangement, stable according to the PBE, B3LYP,B3LYPD3 methods, but a transition state by the MP2 method. Results consistently indicated the D6h isomer is the most stable one among the C24 isomers studied, while the D2d isomer was found to be the least stable.For the gap energy(GE), the B3LYP,B3LYP-D3 methods yielded higher values compared to the PBEs,with an average DFT (PBE, B3LYP) GE of 1.89eV,whereas the MP2 method showed a substantially higher GE value of 7.6 eV, representing an increase of approximately 0.75.The polarizabilities of the C24 isomers were found to be overestimated by the PBE,B3LYP,B3LYP-D3 methods when compared to the corresponding MP2 values.The PBE-D3 method produced higher polarizabilities for the C24 isomers in comparison to the B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, MP2 methods.The investigation confirms that the Oh (D12h) isomer has the smallest (largest) polarizability.The polarizability of D12h is notably affected by the selected DFT method, while that of Oh displays lower sensitivity but shares similarities with D6d.</description>

      <title>Generative design of functional organic molecules for terahertz radiation detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanocavities are molecule-nanoparticle junctions that offer a promising approach to upconvert terahertz radiation into visible or near-infrared light, enabling nanoscale detection at room temperature. However, the identification of molecules with strong terahertz-to-visible upconversion efficiency is limited by the availability of suitable compounds in commercial databases. Here, we employ the generative autoregressive deep neural network, G-SchNet, to perform property-driven design of novel monothiolated molecules tailored for terahertz radiation detection. To design functional organic molecules, we iteratively bias G-SchNet to drive molecular generation towards highly active and synthesizable molecules based on machine learning-based property predictors, including molecular fingerprints and state-of-the-art neural networks. We study the reliability of these property predictors for generated molecules and analyze the chemical space and properties of generated molecules to identify trends in activity. Finally, we filter generated molecules and plan retrosynthetic routes from commercially available reactants to identify promising novel compounds and their most active vibrational modes in terahertz-to-visible upconversion.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Voltammetry of Ion-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions for Diagnosing Energy Storage Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.</description>

      <title>Molecular Insights into Yb(III) Speciation in Sulfate-Bearing Hydrothermal Fluids from X-ray Absorption Spectra Informed by ab initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical for advanced technologies, yet in hydrothermal aqueous solutions the molecular level details of their interaction with ligands that control their geochemical transport and deposition remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the coordination behavior of Yb(III) in sulfate-rich hydrothermal fluids using in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. By integrating multi-angle EXAFS with AIMD-derived constraints, we precisely resolve Yb(III) coordination structures and ligand interactions under hydrothermal conditions. At room temperature, Yb (III) is coordinated by five water molecules and two sulfate ligands (coordination number, CN = 8), forming a distorted square antiprism geometry. Increasing temperature induces progressive dehydration, reducing the hydration shell and favoring stronger sulfate complexation. At 200 Celsius, sulfate ligands reorganize around Yb(III), shifting its geometry to a capped dodecahedron (CN = 7). At 300 Celsius, sulfate binding dominates, leading to structural reorganization that parallels the onset of sulfate mineral precipitation, consistent with the retrograde solubility of REE sulfates. These findings provide direct molecular-scale evidence that sulfate acts as both a transport and deposition ligand, critically influencing REE mobility in geochemical environments. Our results can also help to refine thermodynamic models of REE speciation in high-temperature hydrothermal fluids and improve our understanding of REE ore formation processes in nature.</description>

      <title>Decoding Binding Pathways of Ligands in Prolyl Oligopeptidase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, pose a growing global health burden. Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in these diseases. Recent studies have shown that direct interaction between PREP and pathological proteins, such as $\alpha$-synuclein and Tau, influences protein aggregation and neuronal function. While most known PREP inhibitors primarily target its enzymatic functions, a new class of ligands, known as HUPs, specifically modulates protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are crucial in neurodegenerative diseases. These structurally distinct ligands exhibit diverse binding behaviors, highlighting the importance of understanding their binding pathways. In this study, we analyzed the binding pathways and stability of diverse ligands using molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques. Traditional inhibitors, such as KYP-2047, target the active site between the catalytic domains of PREP and the $\beta$-propeller domain, while HUP ligands bind to alternative regions, such as the hinge site, potentially disrupting non-enzymatic PPIs. We demonstrated that structural variations among ligands lead to distinct binding and unbinding pathways. Free-energy profiles from umbrella sampling revealed key kinetic bottlenecks and differences in pathways. For example, HUP-55 exhibits pathway hopping, characterized by diffuse exploration of binding regions before selecting an exit, while KYP-2047 prefers the central tunnel of the $\beta$-propeller domain even under perturbations. These results suggest that the dynamic interaction between ligands and PREP plays a critical role in their mechanism. The ability of HUPs to interact with multiple binding sites and adapt to PREP's conformational changes may be essential for their PPI-targeting effects.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer capacitors including beyond-mean-field electrostatic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</description>

      <title>Fast simulation of soft x-ray near-edge spectra using a relativistic state-interaction approach: Application to closed-shell transition metal complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques based on core-level excitations provide powerful tools for probing molecular and electronic structures with high spatial resolution. However, accurately calculating spectral features at the L or M edges is challenging due to the significant influence of spin-orbit and multiplet effects. While scalar-relativistic effects can be incorporated at minimal computational cost, accounting for spin-orbit interactions requires more complex computational frameworks. In this work, we develop and apply the state-interaction approach, incorporating relativistic effects using the ZORA-Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, to simulate near-edge soft X-ray absorption spectra for closed-shell transition metal complexes. The computed spin-orbit splittings closely match those obtained from more rigorous methods. This approach provides a practical and cost-effective alternative to more rigorous two-component methods, making it particularly valuable for large-scale calculations and applications such as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering simulations, where capturing a large number of excited states is essential.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects on properties of halogen group elements/ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This srudy investigates the influence of relativistic effects on some properties of the halogen group and gold atoms, including their ions. The analysis covers radii, orbital's energy, first and second ionization energies, electron affinity, and polarizability. The study confirms that the p1/2 orbitals contract under relativistic effects, whereas for the p3/2 orbitals, the mass-velocity and spin-orbit effects do not appear to cancel each other out completely. This may indicate that the spion-orbit effect grows, when increasing the atomic number, slightly faster than the mass-velocity effect. In addition, expansion of the np3/2 orbitals may lead to dilation of the bond length in the related molecules.
  We found that the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock method gave, for atoms from fluorine to iodine, first ionization energy values with smaller deviations from their experimental ones than other methods involving relativistic and correlation effects. In particular, the method accurately, up to three significative digits, predicts the experimental value for chlorine, and thus can be adopted, discarding other sophisticated methods considering the huge computational effort required by them while not improving much on the agreement with experiment, when evaluating physical-chemical properties of large systems containing light halogen elements. It also predicts an electron affinity of $2.4 eV$ for the tennessine atom, where it shows also that the relativistic effects play a more important role than in gold atoms.</description>

      <title>Chemical Foundation Model Guided Design of High Ionic Conductivity Electrolyte Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optimal formulations is a major challenge in developing electrolytes for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to the vast combinatorial design space and complex interplay between multiple constituents. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to uncover underlying chemical design rules and accelerate the process of formulation discovery. In this work, we present an approach to design new formulations that can achieve target performance, using a generalizable chemical foundation model. The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM): Predicting Phase Transitions Across Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing phase transitions is crucial for understanding generic physical phenomena such as crystallization, protein folding and others. However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</description>

      <title>Revealing the proton slingshot mechanism in solid acid electrolytes through machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.</description>

      <title>pyTTN: An Open Source Toolbox for Open and Closed System Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Tree Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\"atze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational quantum annealing (VarQA) algorithm for electronic structure theory, in which we use the quantum annealer as a sampler and prepare an ansatz state through its statistics. We also introduce a strategy called the "digitizer" for searching the space of variational parameters efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VarQA by evaluating the ground-state potential energy surface for molecules with up to $20$ spin orbitals as well as an excited-state potential energy surface. This approach resembles the workings of the quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs), but is generalized to handle distributions beyond the Boltzmann distribution. In VarQA, with the number of required logical qubits equal to the number of spin orbitals, a fully connected Ising Hamiltonian can be readily implemented in a large-scale quantum annealer as a scalable ansatz for electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Deep Mantle-Atmosphere Coupling and Carbonaceous Bombardment: Options for Biomolecule Formation on an Oxidized Early Earth</title>

Abstract: Understanding what environmental conditions prevailed on early Earth during the Hadean eon, and how this set the stage for the origins of life, remains a challenge. Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by chondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping an atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical synthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can rain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic molecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could condense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the ingredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources of reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic molecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model. We find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment can produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\sim 1-10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially oxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\,\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce the atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations are sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies. RNA could have appeared on Earth immediately after it became habitable (about $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Moon-forming impact), or it could have (re)appeared later at any time up to the beginning of the Archean.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Atomistic Simulation of Chemistry and Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the power of large language and large vision models, it is of profound and fundamental interest to ask if a foundational model based on data and parameter scaling laws and pre-training strategies is possible for learned simulations of chemistry and materials. The scaling of large and diverse datasets and highly expressive architectures for chemical and materials sciences should result in a foundation model that is more efficient and broadly transferable, robust to out-of-distribution challenges, and easily fine-tuned to a variety of downstream observables, when compared to specific training from scratch on targeted applications in atomistic simulation. In this Perspective we aim to cover the rapidly advancing field of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP), and to illustrate a path to create chemistry and materials MLIP foundation models at larger scale.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science simulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy: multi-reference random phase approximation via diagrammatic resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>
