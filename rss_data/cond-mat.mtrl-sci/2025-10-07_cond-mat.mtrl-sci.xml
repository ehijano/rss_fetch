      <title>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</description>

      <title>Strain Effects on Electronic Properties of Cobalt-Based Coordination Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the strain effects on the electronic properties of
  cobalt-based benzenehexathiol (CoBHT) coordination nanosheets using
  first-principles calculations. Two distinct crystal structures,
  high-density structure (HDS) and low-density structure (LDS), are
  explored. Our results reveal that HDS behaves as a metal, while LDS
  exhibits semiconducting. Spin-polarized electronic band structures highlight the presence of energy band structures of Kagome lattice, and
  the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) results in band gap openings
  at high-symmetric K points. Furthermore, we construct the tight-binding
  model to investigate the topological properties of CoBHT,
  demonstrating anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the intrinsic
  Berry curvature. The impact of uniaxial
  strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of CoBHT is also studied. Strain
  induces significant modifications in magnetic moments and density
  of states, particularly in the HDS. Anomalous Hall conductivity is
  enhanced under hole-doping conditions, suggesting that strain can be
  used to tailor the electronic properties of CoBHT for specific
  applications. Our findings underscore the potential of CoBHT nanosheets
  for use in next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and catalytic
  devices with tunable properties through strain engineering.</description>

      <title>New Directions in Focused Ion Beam Induced Deposition for the Nanoprinting of Functional 3D Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focused ion beam (FIB) microscope is well established as a high-resolution machining instrument capable of site-selectively removing material down to the nanoscale. Beyond subtractive processing, however, the FIB can also add material using a technique known as focused ion beam induced deposition (FIBID), enabling the direct-write of complex nanostructures. This work explores new directions in three-dimensional nanoprinting with FIBID, harnessing unique features of helium and neon FIBs to fabricate nanoscale heterostructures, including multimaterial architectures and deposits with engineered internal voids. Detailed insight into the chemical and structural composition of these nanostructures is obtained using advanced electron microscopy, revealing buried interfaces and material transformations. Building on these results, the evolution of FIBID into a versatile platform for functional nanomaterials design is discussed, opening pathways toward next-generation nanoscale devices and technologies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically Engineered Titanium Suboxide Films for High-Efficiency Solar Thermal Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of broadband solar absorber coatings based on titanium suboxide composite thin films on aluminium substrates. The films are fabricated via scalable DC magnetron sputtering using a Ti target, followed by post-annealing in a fixed $O_2$ partial pressure of 0.45 mbar. By tuning deposition time and annealing temperature, a composite phase of $Ti_2O_3$ and $TiO_2$ was achieved. The Raman mapping of the films substantiates the distribution and coexistence of the two phases. The optimized sample, deposited for 10 min and annealed at 500 $^oC$, exhibited a superior solar absorptance (${\alpha}_s$ = 0.913) and optimally low thermal emittance (${\epsilon}_t$ = 0.11). Nevertheless, the 15- and 20-min deposited films also showed a promising absorptance (&gt;0.85) and emittance values (&lt;0.13). Morphological studies revealed island-type nanostructures, leading to enhanced photothermal performance via electric field confinement, which is validated by optical simulations. This work provides a promising route toward efficient, scalable, and cost-effective spectrally selective solar absorbers for solar thermal applications.</description>

      <title>In-situ characterisation and data-driven crystal plasticity analysis of short-to-long crack transition in a ductile aluminium alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crack arrest in ductile alloys plays a critical role in damage-tolerant design for aerospace and structural applications, yet the transition from microstructure-sensitive short cracks to load-controlled long cracks remains poorly understood. Here, we present an in-situ, high-resolution experimental study of crack propagation in cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy using scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and novel data-driven crystal plasticity modelling that uses the SEM-DIC and EBSD directly to calculate the stress. The local (elastic) mode I and II stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the (elastic and elastoplastic) energy release rate were extracted from the DIC-measured displacement field and correlated with the crack interaction with microstructural features. We find that the microstructure-sensitive crack grows in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rate until reaching a critical energy release rate, where the crack's process zone becomes large enough to invoke plastic deformation that blunts the crack, marking a transition from elastically driven microstructure-sensitive crack propagation to plasticity-dominated crack arrest. Our findings establish that the short-to-long crack transition is process-zone governed, rather than being length-scale governed.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic effects in some sliding ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we investigate for the first time the electro-optic (EO) response of these materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a novel, universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides, as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and reveal novel EO mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The magnon spectra of g-type altermagnet bulk CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the magnon spectra and chiral lifetimes of altermagnons in bulk CrSb using the many-body perturbation theory. The spin-split band structure is evident in the magnon spectra. Altermagnons attain an energy of 275 meV at the K point of the Brillouin zone. Due to large spin splitting at a specific ${\bf q}$ point along the A - M direction, lifetime differences of chiral altermagnons reach approximately 20 fs.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Novel CDW Superstructure in Monolayer 1T-$VS_{2}$ at Room Temperature and its Evolution in Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate ($2 \times 2$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron spectroscopy, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate $\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate ($2\times2$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW superstructure of the monolayer. Our findings provide an important platform for understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} with thickness and V self-intercalation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid MBE Route to Adsorption-Controlled Growth of BaTiO3 Membranes with Robust Polarization Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding ferroelectric membranes are promising for flexible electronics, nonvolatile memory, photonics, and spintronics, but their synthesis is challenged by the need for reproducibility with precise stoichiometric control. Here, we demonstrate the adsorption-controlled growth of single-crystalline, epitaxial BaTiO3 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a binary oxide sacrificial layer. Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained submillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal symmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high dielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the membranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop measurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a remnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These results were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These results establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing stoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration into next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices.</description>

      <title>Adsorption-induced surface magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer. Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states, driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without inherently magnetic components, offering new avenues for engineering spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Finding the temperature window for atomic layer deposition of ruthenium metal via efficient phonon calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of first principles thermodynamics based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) to examine the gas-surface chemistry of an oxidized ruthenium surface reacting with hydrogen gas. This reaction system features in the growth of ultrathin Ru films by atomic layer deposition (ALD). We reproduce and rationalize the experimental observation that ALD of the metal from RuO4 and H2 occurs only in a narrow temperature window above 100{\deg}C, and this validates the approach. Specifically, the temperature-dependent reaction free energies are computed for the competing potential reactions of the H2 reagent, and show that surface oxide is reduced to water, which is predicted to desorb thermally above 113{\deg}C, exposing bare Ru that can further react to surface hydride, and hence deposit Ru metal. The saturating coverages give a predicted growth rate of 0.7 \r{A}/cycle of Ru. At lower temperatures, free energies indicate that water is retained at the surface and reacts with the RuO4 precursor to form an oxide film, also in agreement with experiment. The temperature dependence is obtained with the required accuracy by computing Gibbs free energy corrections from phonon calculations within the harmonic approximation. Surface phonons are computed rapidly and efficiently by parallelization on a cloud architecture within the Schr\"odinger Materials Science Suite. We also show that rotational and translational entropy of gases dominate the free energies, permitting an alternative approach without phonon calculations, which would be suitable for rapid pre-screening of gas-surface chemistries.</description>

      <title>A van der Waals material exhibiting room temperature broken inversion symmetry with ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the initial synthesis of van der Waals two-dimensional indium selenide was first documented in 1957, five distinct polymorphs and their corresponding polytypes have been identified. In this study, we report a unique phase of indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the $\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a low-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Machine Learning with Cartesian Natural Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic machine learning (ML) is a transformative tool for accurate and efficient investigation of material behavior at the atomic scale. While such models have been constructed within Cartesian space to harness geometric information and preserve intuitive physical representations, they face inherent challenges - primarily due to the lack of a systematic symmetry-preserving framework for representing arbitrary physical tensors. We address these challenges by proposing Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet) as a general framework for atomistic ML. We first develop the theory of irreducible representations using Cartesian natural tensors (their creation, operation, as well as the decomposition and reconstruction of physical tensors such as the elastic constant tensor). Leveraging this machinery, we design an equivariant Cartesian model and demonstrate its exceptional performance across diverse atomistic ML tasks. CarNet enables the development of highly accurate and reliable interatomic potentials for both materials and molecular systems. Furthermore, structure-property relationships can be readily constructed for tensorial quantities ranging from simple properties like the dipole moment to arbitrary high-rank tensors with complex symmetries such as the elastic constant tensor -- capabilities that were previously inaccessible. This work removes theoretical barriers and unleashes the power of Cartesian approaches for advanced atomistic ML in the understanding and design of new materials.</description>

However, their rapid ambient degradation and the difficulty of obtaining large-area monolayer samples have limited the available experimental probes, leaving their detailed electronic structure near the Fermi level largely unexplored. In this work, by performing micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES) on an identical sample transformed from monolayer WSe2 to Janus WSSe via a H2 plasma-assisted chalcogen-exchange method, we reveal the evolution of its electronic band structure. We observe ARPES signature consistent with the Rashba-type spin splitting due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, and a significant upward shift of the highest valence band at the {\Gamma}-point by approximately 160 meV. These direct observations clarify the key electronic modifications that govern the material's properties and provide a pathway for band engineering in Janus TMDs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear inelasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in FCC crystals, oriented like during typical simulations performed in studies of the dynamics of line dislocations. The proposed description is inspired by and supported by MD simulations. We find out that a force that is perpendicular to the direction of the applied external shear pressure and in the direction of line dislocations occurs within the bulk of crystal volume. The force is of a dynamic origin, and it has not been analyzed so far. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear and non-elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic potential for interaction between atoms and propose an analytical model of their dynamics. The model predicts some effects that may have been overlooked in experiments and are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity of crystals.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal transport spin polarization of spin degenerate antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vital goal in spintronics is the efficient electrical generation of spin currents, a pursuit that has recently focused on using antiferromagnets (AFMs) as spin current sources. It has been demonstrated that antiferromagnets with broken PT symmetry (parity + time reversal) can efficiently generate longitudinal and transverse spin currents. At the same time, it has been generally thought that antiferromagnets with PT symmetry (PT-AFMs) forbid the longitudinal spin polarization due to their spin-degenerate band structure. Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we show, using theoretical analysis based on magnetic point group symmetry, that most PT-AFMs can generate longitudinal spin currents due to spin-orbit coupling. Using density-functional theory, we calculate the longitudinal spin conductivity of representative PT-AFMs, L10-MnPt and Mn2Au, and show that its magnitude is comparable to that of their PT-broken counterparts. Our symmetry-enabled classification of antiferromagnets and theoretical results for the longitudinal spin conductivity in representative PT-AFMs expands our understanding of spin transport and shows the possibility of robust spin-current generation in a broad range of spin-degenerate antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Carrier Loss in Mg-Doped N-Polar GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complex was found to be the primary compensator in Mg-doped, N-polar GaN. The experimental data showed a sharp drop in hole concentration once [Mg] exceeded ~$10^{19} cm^{-3}$. Temperature-dependent Hall measurements, in conjunction with a charge balance model, revealed that the carrier loss was due to a drastic reduction in acceptor concentration ($N_A$), suggesting that a significant fraction of Mg atoms incorporated in an electrically neutral configuration. A quantitative semi-empirical model based on the grand canonical formalism pointed to the formation of $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complexes as the primary cause for the observed carrier loss.</description>

      <title>Investigating into mechanisms of high temperature strength of refractory high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) - MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures. Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated, indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion. Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.</description>

      <title>AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04704v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>Correlative Analysis of Iron-Driven Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties in Natural Biotite Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotite crystals are phyllosilicate trioctahedral micas with the general chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 that form a solid-solution series with iron-poor phlogopite and iron-rich annite endmembers. With a wide band gap energy and a layered structure with free surface charges, biotite nanosheets can be readily obtained by cleavage methods and used as dielectrics in nanodevice fabrication for the next generation of electronics and energy harvesting. Here, a comprehensive study of biotite samples with different iron concentrations and oxidation states is presented. Structural, optical, magneto-optical, and magnetic characterizations were performed using several experimental techniques, including state-of-the-art synchrotron-based techniques, to correlate the iron chemistry (content and oxidation state) with the macroscopic properties of both minerals. The study reveals a nanoscale-homogeneous Fe distribution via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping, defect-mediated optical transitions modulated by Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and temperature-dependent magnetic transitions from paramagnetism to competing ferro-/antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the use of these biotite crystals as substrates for ultrathin heterostructures incorporating monolayer (ML) MoSe2 is explored by magneto photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures. The results show that the presence of iron impurities in different oxidation states significantly impacts the valley properties for ML-MoSe2. Overall, these findings offer a comprehensive interpretation of the physical properties of bulk biotites in a correlative approach, serving as a robust reference for future studies aiming to explore biotites in their ultrathin form.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new insights into the electronic, structural, and transport (heat and charge) properties of the phase-change memory material Ge2Sb2Te5. Using realistic structural models of Konstantinou et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3065 (2019)], we analyze the topology, electronic states, and lattice dynamics with density functional methods, including hybrid-functional calculations and machine-learned interatomic potentials. The Kohn-Sham orbitals near the Fermi level display a strong electron-phonon coupling, and exhibit large energy fluctuations at room temperature. The conduction tail states exhibit larger phonon-induced fluctuations than the valence tail states. To resolve transport at the atomic scale, we employ space-projected electronic conductivity and site-projected thermal conductivity methods. Local analysis of heat transport highlights the role of filamentary networks dominated by Te, with Sb and Ge making progressively smaller contributions.</description>

      <title>Chasing Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into the Degradation of Metal Phthalocyanine Catalysts during Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen reduction catalysts frequently suffer from degradation under harsh operating conditions, and the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this study, we integrate first-principles calculations with a time-dependent microkinetic model to investigate the deactivation pathways of six highly active metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, and Ir) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We quantitatively assess the ORR processes, hydrogen peroxide generation, radical generation, and three primary degradation mechanisms, namely carbon oxidation, nitrogen protonation, and demetallation, through a reaction network involving 40 chemical species and 75 elementary reactions. Our findings reveal that the dominant degradation mechanism varies significantly across the MPcs. Under typical alkaline conditions, the primary byproducts arise from carbon oxidation, driven by .OH radical attack and structural reorganization of surface adsorbates, and from protonation at either the metal center or nitrogen sites. In the kinetics-controlled region, the ORR activity follows the order of RhPc &gt; IrPc &gt; FePc &gt; MnPc &gt; RuPc &gt; CrPc. Notably, RhPc and IrPc demonstrate both higher ORR activity and greater stability than the widely studied FePc under elevated potentials.</description>

      <title>Comparing fine-tuning strategies of MACE machine learning force field for modeling Li-ion diffusion in LiF for batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are transforming materials science and engineering by enabling the study of complex phenomena, such as those critical to battery operation. In this work, we benchmark the MACE machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work, we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself - yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over 40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training data.</description>

      <title>Role of chromium oxides and carbides in strengthening CoCrFeNi multi-principle element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) can potentially offer exceptional material properties, but their complex, costly manufacturing limits their scalability. Chemical complexity and complex manufacturing processes lead to the formation of some secondary phases, which have a significant impact on the final properties. In this work, chromium compound dispersoid enhancements (Cr- oxides and carbides) were formed in CoCrFeNi MPEAs to enhance their microstructural and high-temperature mechanical properties. A single FCC phase was observed in the arc melted (AM) samples, chromium oxides were detected in the gas-atomized (GA) samples, and Cr2O3 with Cr23C6 or Cr7C3 was found in the mechanically alloyed (MA)samples depending on the sintering temperature. Mechanical tests at room temperature and 575{\deg}C, where no phase evolution is expected, showed that the GA samples with oxides achieved enhanced mechanical properties at 575{\deg}C. This was co-induced by precipitation strengthening, recrystallization suppression, and twinning-induced plasticity. The MA samples with carbides exhibited high strength but low ductility, with Cr7C3 outperforming Cr23C6 because of its lower hardness and twinning effects. This work links chromium compound evolution to mechanical performance of MPEAs, offering insights to optimize HEA production for high-temperature applications through controlled phase formation.</description>

Abstract: Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopologues is crucial for applications such as the recycling of exhaust streams in nuclear fusion reactors. Using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), we report, for the first time, on separation experiments of a ternary 1,2,3H isotope mixture, achieving tritium enrichment of 70% from an initially equimolar (1:1:1) gas mixture, based on selective adsorption using an Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite type Y. Further experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen temperature.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of contact time on leachate chemistry from recycled concrete aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH &gt; 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.</description>

Abstract: The ability to dynamically control the relative orientation of layers in two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures represents a critical step toward the realization of reconfigurable nanoscale devices. Existing actuation methods often rely on mechanical contact, complex architectures, or extreme operating conditions, which limit their applicability and scalability. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of contactless electrostatic actuation based on electron-beam-induced charge injection. By locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an electrically grounded graphene layer, we create an interfacial electric field that generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement. We validate the induced rotation through in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>High Cycle S-N curve prediction for Al 7075-T6 alloy using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.</description>

      <title>Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theoretic Decomposition of Kubo-Greenwood Conductivities in the Projector Augmented Wave Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state transitions at different incident photon energies.</description>

      <title>Training Variation of Physically-Informed Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.</description>

      <title>High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</description>

      <title>Insulating transport in anisotropic metals: breakdown of Drude transport and the puzzling $c$-axis resistivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and other layered oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a mechanism that may explain the non-metallic out-of-plane resistivity in layered metals. By carefully examining how the Drude-Boltzmann expression for the $c$-axis conductivity emerges out of the Kubo formula, we find, besides the standard metallic term proportional to the carrier lifetime $\tau$, a non-Drude contribution proportional to $1/\tau$. The Drude behavior breaks down when $1/\tau &gt; 2 \eta^*$, the crossover value $\eta^*$ being small (and hence observable) when the $c$-axis velocities vary rapidly with the distance from the Fermi surface. We consider the Hund metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a test case, which we study within a realistic dynamical mean-field theory approach. The non-Drude behavior observed experimentally in $c$-axis transport is reproduced and explained by our considerations, showing that earlier invoked extrinsic mechanisms that involve either impurities or phonons are unnecessary. We point out that the small value of $\eta^*$ is due to a peculiar accidental cancellation due to destructive interference characteristic of body-centered tetragonal lattices.</description>

Abstract: In this study, binary $ZnSe:Fe^{2+}$ crystals and ternary $Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}Se:Fe^{2+}$ crystals $(0 &lt; x &lt; 0.6)$ were grown by the vertical Bridgman method in graphite crucibles under high argon pressure. A comparative characterization of the structural, energetic, and optical parameters of the obtained crystals was performed. Theoretical explanations of the observed experimental characteristics, including the specific red-shift of the absorption and emission spectra with increasing solid-solution concentration, are provided. These results could be useful for the development of new laser media based on simple and complex AIIBVI crystals and for targeted engineering of their optical properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission in Monolayer WSe2 Transferred onto InP Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized quantum emitters in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as solid-state candidates for on-demand sources of single photons. Due to the role of strain in the site-selective creation of TMD emitters, their hybrid integration into photonic structures such as cavities and waveguides is possible using pick-and-place methods. Here we investigate quantum emission from a hybrid structure consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 interfaced with horizontally aligned InP nanowires (NWs). Our experiments reveal multiple narrow and bright emission peaks in the 715-785 nm spectral range and g(2)(0) as low as 0.049, indicating strong antibunching and good single photon purity. The faceted nature of III-V NWs provides unique opportunities for strain engineering, including the potential for placement of emitters on the top surface for optimal coupling. Our findings pave the way for realizing hybrid quantum light sources for integrated quantum photonics that could combine III-V quantum dots with TMD emitters into a single platform.</description>

      <title>Optical conductivity and band gap in the double-Weyl candidate SrSi2 at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the possible double-Weyl state in cubic SrSi2 using optical spectroscopy. The complex optical conductivity was measured in a frequency range from 70 to 22 000 cm-1 at temperatures down to 10 K at ambient pressure. The optical response of SrSi2 can be well separated into the intraband (free carriers) and interband contributions. Additionally, four infrared-active phonons are detected. As follows from the optical spectra, the free-carrier density decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with an activation behaviour. Experimental interband conductivity juxtaposed with ab initio calculations shows that conventional density-functional theory fails to describe the electronic structure of SrSi2 in the vicinity of the Fermi level. A semi-local exchange-correlation potential allows a much better agreement with the experiment, resulting in the trivial (gapped) band structure of SrSi2. The direct gap estimated from the measurements is approximately 40 meV.</description>

      <title>Novel family of near-room-temperature compensated itinerant pyrochlore ferrimagnets, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series, ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$ does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of ${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$ is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions, respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Atomic defects in solid-state materials are building blocks for future quantum technologies, such as quantum communication networks, computers, and sensors. Until recently, a handful of defects in a small selection of host materials have been possible candidates. Recent developments have revealed that hexagonal boron nitride, a wide-bandgap two-dimensional material, hosts single-photon-emitting atomic defects with access to optically addressable electronic and nuclear spins at room temperature. Now, atomically thin quantum devices that operate at ambient conditions are a possibility. In this perspective, we discuss the recent progress, and challenges, in understanding the fundamental photophysics of defects in hBN, as well as specific opportunities they present for the development of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: A model of dissipative micromagnetics coupled to elasticity is developed, following the procedures of the Ericksen-Leslie theory of nematic liquid crystals allowing for angular momentum due to magnetization. An outcome is the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory coupled to material spin. A further power-less augmentation to the angular momentum of the theory with classical kinetic energy density is also considered, which allows for plausible approaches to model the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects within continuum mechanics, as well as hard magnetic soft materials treated as constrained polar materials within the overall framework.</description>

      <title>Systematic evolution of superconducting pairing strength and Seebeck coefficients in correlated infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$ exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</description>

      <title>Pronounced orbital-selective electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in V2Se2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized. Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously, the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant spin injection of exciton-polaritons with halide perovskites at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid photon-exciton quasiparticles, constitute a useful platform for the study of light-matter interaction and nonlinear photonic applications. In this work, we realize a monolithic Tamm-plasmon microcavity embedding a thin film of two-dimensional halide perovskites with a tunable polymer spacer that controls the exciton-photon detuning. Angle-resolved optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices, including chiral lasers and switches.</description>

      <title>Systematic cRPA study of two-dimensional MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials: From unconventional screening to correlation-driven instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than 60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic, cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers, highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} &gt; W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W &gt; 1 $ in multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally, selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent collective behavior in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface Acoustic Wave gas sensors have garnered increasing attention as highly sensitive, miniaturized, and wireless compatible platforms for molecular detection. Their unique ability to convert surface perturbations into measurable acoustic shifts makes them ideal for gas sensing across diverse environments. This review synthesizes reported SAW platforms across substrates and modes Rayleigh, SH-SAW, Love links transduction pathways to material choice, and benchmarks performance for key analytes, e.g., NO2, NH3, VOCs, CO2, etc. We catalogue nanostructured oxides, polymers, carbon based films, and hybrid heterojunction coatings, highlighting attributes such as porosity, surface chemistry, and interfacial charge transfer that govern sensitivity and reversibility. We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them. Looking ahead, we envision the evolution of SAW platforms into intelligent, autonomous sensing systems with applications in environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Controlling an altermagnetic spin density wave in the kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Boron Nitride as an Ultrathin Copper Diffusion Barrier for Advanced Interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with thermodynamics. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a general first-principles methodology for computing electronic structure in a finite uniform magnetic field which allows for an arbitrary rational magnetic flux and nonlocal pseudopotentials, at a comparable time complexity of conventional plane-wave pseudopotential approaches in zero-field conditions. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through comprehensive applications to both molecular and crystalline systems, including calculations of magnetizabilities, magnetically induced currents, and magnetic energy bands. Furthermore, we provide rigorous proofs of two properties for crystals in uniform magnetic fields: the "strong translational symmetry" and "magnetic bands shift" phenomena.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of spin-orbit-torque-assisted magnetization dynamics in Co/Pt bilayers: Importance of the orbital torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism driving magnetization switching in spin-orbit-torque-assisted devices remains a subject of debate. While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization typically plays a minor role in compounds where the magnetic properties are governed by transition metal elements. However, in some cases, the orbital magnetization may be fully unquenched, which can have dramatic consequences for magnetic anisotropy and various magnetic response properties. In the present work, we start by summarizing how unquenched orbital moments arise from particular combinations of crystal field splitting and orbital filling. We exemplify this for the cases of two-dimensional (2D) VI$_3$ and FePS$_3$, and show that Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling are crucial ingredients for predicting correct orbital moments from first principles calculations. We then search the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) for monolayers having tetrahedral or octahedral crystal field splitting of transition metal $d$-states and orbital occupancy that is expected to lead to large orbital moments. We identify 112 monolayers with octahedral crystal field splitting and 62 monolayers with tetrahedral crystal field splitting and for materials with partially filled $t_{2g}$ bands, we verify that inclusion of Hubbard corrections as well as self-consistent spin-orbit coupling typically increases the magnitude of predicted orbital moments by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors such as \b{eta}-Ga2O3 are ideal materials for next-generation power electronic devices. Electronic and mechanical properties of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 can be tuned by alloying with other sesquioxides, notably Al2O3 and In2O3. Moreover, by tuning the In content of a (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloy, its lattice constants can be matched to those of Ga2O3, while preserving a large conduction-band offset. In view of potential applications to \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton mobility in two-dimensional semiconductors is a key ingredient in materials-based design of optoelectronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) set a good test case, with tightly bound excitons and designable flexibility that offer an ideal platform for realizing strain effects on exciton energy transfer. Here, we present an ab initio study to construct strain-induced exciton energy profiles and model exciton dynamics on top of these potential surfaces. We focus on inhomogeneously-strained monolayer WS$_2$, combining excitonic band structures derived from many-body perturbation theory for a large variety of strain profiles and calculate the change in mobility characteristics using a semiclassical ballistic transport model. We connect a wealth of strain patterns to exciton drift, diffusion, and confinement. Our results point to strain-induced regimes of super-ballistic propagation and an anomalous effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. Our results provide structure-specific understanding of ballistic strain-tunable exciton behavior, offering design principles for engineering exciton dynamics in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized chiral ZnIn2S4 for targeted solar-driven CO2 reduction to acetic acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target product for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock supply. Although photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCCR) can generate acetic acid alongside other multicarbon products, its yield is typically low, limited by competing reactions and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 (CMZI) photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 {umol g-1 h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3 %. This yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity10. The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic effect between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on {102} crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction toward the efficient and scalable synthesis of various multicarbon products.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity of oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed a superparamagnetic-type response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (&gt; 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the ultra-small cores of the nanoparticles.Thus, obtained results open the way for the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for advanced FETs and electronic logic elements.</description>

Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</description>

      <title>Non-local electrical detection of spin-polarized surface currents in the 3D topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-polarized surface states in topological insulators offer unique transport characteristics that make them distinguishable from trivial conductors. Here, we detect the impact of these surface states in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_{2}$ by electrical means using a non-local transport configuration with ferromagnetic Co/Al$_2$O$_3$ electrodes. We show that the non-local measurement allows to probe the surface currents flowing along the whole surface, i.e.~from the top along the side to the bottom surface and back to the top surface along the opposite side. Increasing the temperature increases the interaction between bulk and surface states, which shortens this non-local current path along the surface and hence leads to a complete disappearance of the non-local signal at around 20K. Interestingly, we observe that the ratio between spin signal to background signal is much larger in the non-local geometry compared to the local one. Given that the observed ratio in the non-local geometry aligns well with expectations for spin-polarized surface states, our findings suggest that an as-yet unresolved mechanism diminishes the spin signal in the local geometry.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet states in laser-dressed crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions can create non-equilibrium materials with on-demand novel functionalities. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet theorem provides the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these laser-dressed systems. However, signatures of the Floquet states are needed, as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics, can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy based on the Floquet formalism to finally capture the full frequency-dependence in the optical response properties of realistic laser-dressed crystals, and use it investigate the Floquet engineering in a first-principle model for ZnO of full dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, laser-controllable, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <title>Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric truss metamaterials: data-driven design and additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

Abstract: Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments. This article established a solid foundation for controlling the XV system, thus paving the way for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</description>
