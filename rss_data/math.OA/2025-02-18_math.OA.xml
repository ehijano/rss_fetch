      <title>Quantum Mycielskians: symmetries, twin vertices and distinguishing labelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a generalization of the Mycielski construction to quantum graphs. We discuss quantum symmetries of quantum Mycielskians and their relation to quantum symmetries of the original quantum graphs. We introduce a quantum generalization of the notion of graphs with twin vertices and check that this concept coincides with its classical version for classical graphs with few vertices. Finally, we propose the quantum generalization of the distinguishing number and study its behavior under the quantum Mycielski construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum inequalities and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various quantum inequalities have been established on quantum symmetries in the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. We provide a detailed introduction to quantum inequalities including Hausdorff-Young inequality, Young's inequality, uncertainty principles, entropic convolution inequalities etc on subfactors, an important type of quantum symmetries. We cite several applications of the complete positivity of the comultiplication in category theory and subfactor theory, which indicate the fundamental differences between quantum inequalities and non-commutative inequalities. We also review the Perron-Frobenius theorem together with the algebraic structures of eigenvector spaces.</description>

      <title>Unitary orthonormal bases of finite dimensional inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner and Popa for inclusions $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ where $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ are finite dimensional von Neumann algebras and $E$ is a conditional expectation map from $\mathcal{A}$ onto $\mathcal{B}$. It is shown that existence of such bases requires that the associated inclusion matrix satisfies a spectral condition forcing dimension vectors to be Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors and the conditional expectation map preserves the Markov trace. Subject to these conditions, explicit unitary orthonormal bases are constructed if either one of the algebras is abelian or simple. They generalize complex Hadamard matrices, Weyl unitary bases, and a recent work of Crann et al which correspond to the special cases of $\mathcal{A}$ being abelian, simple, and general multi-matrix algebras respectively with $\mathcal{B}$ being the algebra of complex numbers. For the first time $\mathcal{B}$ is more general. As an application of these results it is shown that if $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ admits a unitary orthonormal basis then the Connes-St{\o}rmer relative entropy $H(\mathcal{A}_1|\mathcal{A})$ equals the logarithm of the square of the norm of the inclusion matrix, where $\mathcal{A}_1$ denotes the Jones basic construction of the inclusion. As a further application, we prove the existence of unitary orthonormal bases for a large class of depth 2 subfactors with abelian relative commutant.</description>

      <title>Real operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. For example in the final two sections of our paper we study real versions of the Kirchberg conjectures etc, and show that they are equivalent. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject.</description>

      <title>Outlier eigenvalues for full rank deformed single ring random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n \times n$ deterministic matrix and $\Sigma_n$ be a deterministic non-negative matrix such that $A_n$ and $\Sigma_n$ converge in $*$-moments to operators $a$ and $\Sigma$ respectively in some $W^*$-probability space. We consider the full rank deformed model $A_n + U_n \Sigma_n V_n,$ where $U_n$ and $V_n$ are independent Haar-distributed random unitary matrices. In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues of $A_n + U_n\Sigma_n V_n$ in two domains that are outside the support of the Brown measure of $a +u \Sigma$. We give a sufficient condition to guarantee that outliers are stable in one domain, and we also prove that there are no outliers in the other domain. When $A_n$ has a bounded rank, the first domain is exactly the one outside the outer boundary of the single ring, and the second domain is the inner disk of the single ring. Our results generalize the results of Benaych-Georges and Rochet (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016).</description>

      <title>The uniform dimension of a monoid with applications to graph algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Goldie's concept of uniform dimensions from module theory over rings to $\Gamma$-monoids. A $\Gamma$-monoid $M$ is said to have uniform dimension $n$ if $n$ is the largest number of pairwise incomparable nonzero $\Gamma$-order ideals contained in $M$.
  Specializing to the talented monoid of a graph, we show that the uniform dimension provides a rough measure of how the graph branches out. Since for any order ideal $I$, its orthogonal ideal $I^\perp$ is the largest ideal incomparable to $I$, we study the notions of orthogonality and regularity, particularly when $I^{\perp\perp}=I$. We show that the freeness of the action of $\mathbb Z$ on the talented monoid of a graph is preserved under quotienting by a regular ideal. Furthermore, we determine the underlying hereditary and saturated sets that generate these ideals. These results unify recent studies on regular ideals of the corresponding Leavitt path algebras and graph $C^*$-algebras.
  We conclude that for graphs $E$ and $F$, if there is a $\mathbb Z$-monoid isomorphism $T_E\cong T_F$, then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the regular ideals of the associated Leavitt path algebras $L_K(E)$ and $L_K(F)$ (and similarly, $C^*(E)$ and $C^*(F)$). Since the talented monoid $T_E$ is the positive cone of the graded Grothendieck group $K_0^{gr}(L_K(E))$, this provides further evidence supporting the Graded Classification Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-induction of Graded Local Conformal Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-induction of graded local conformal nets is studied. We show that inclusions of graded local conformal nets give rise to braided subfactors so that the $\alpha$-induction is still effective for graded local conformal nets. As an application, we give a shorter proof of classification of $N=2$ superconformal nets in the discrete series.</description>
