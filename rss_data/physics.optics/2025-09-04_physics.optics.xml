      <title>Neural Network Model for OAM Crosstalk due to Turbulence-Induced Tilt and Lateral Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modelling orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode crosstalk in turbulent environments is challenging yet essential for developing free-space optical systems that employ OAM modes for multiplexing or diversity. Turbulence induces tip/tilt aberrations and lateral displacement, which significantly degrade system performance. Existing analytical models describe the transformation from an input Gaussian mode to an output OAM spectrum; however, our feed forward neural network model generalizes this approach by accounting for the effects of these aberrations on arbitrary input OAM modes. We validate the model experimentally by estimating turbulence-induced tilt and lateral displacement using a dual-camera setup and comparing the estimated spectrum with the actual modal decomposition. With a typical root mean square error of less than 11%, our results indicate that the model could serve as a reliable source of meta-information for digital signal processing, soft-decision forward error correction or perhaps dynamic mode hopping in future systems.</description>

      <title>Robust End-to-End FSO Transmission with Joint Coding Modulation and BiLSTM-Based Channel Modeling under Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free space optical (FSO) communication is considered a promising solution in next_generation communication networks. However, its performance is significantly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. To enhance system robustness to turbulence, we propose a turbulence_robust end_to_end FSO communication system (TRFSO) that integrates a data-driven channel model with joint source_channel coding modulation (JSCCM). Specifically, a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)_based channel model is developed and trained on data collected over a physical FSO link under varying turbulence conditions. This model accurately captures real_world channel distortions, achieving a minimum Kullback_Leibler (KL) divergence of 0.0019 in amplitude distribution matching. Experimental results show that the TRFSO system trained with the BiLSTM_based channel model outperforms the same architecture trained under the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, achieving an average 3.5 dB improvement in multi-scale structural similarity (MS_SSIM) under strong atmospheric turbulence. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TRFSO in achieving robust and reliable transmission under dynamic atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Optical Performance of Liquid Crystal Lens Arrays via Electrode Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A liquid crystal (LC) lens array based on double-layer composite electrodes, characterized by a large aperture, short focal length, and low operating voltage is demonstrated. The lens array consists of an LC layer, a top common electrode, a bottom double-layer composite electrode layer, and an oxide layer. The bottom double-layer composite electrode layer comprises the pixel electrodes and the auxiliary electrode. In focusing mode, the pixel electrodes receive operational voltage to establish the LC layer's electric field, with the auxiliary electrode applying reduced voltage for field optimization. Experiment results show that the proposed LC lens array achieves the shortest focal length of 3.3 mm when the pixel electrodes are set at 5.2 Vrms and the auxiliary electrode is set at 2.6 Vrms. This design addresses the technical challenge of achieving larger apertures (800 {\mu}m or more), offering enhanced viewing zones and improved 3D performance. This configuration provides an ideal refractive index distribution in a relatively thick LC layer, enabling 2D/3D switchable display with performance superior to current LC lens arrays of equivalent aperture. Furthermore, the proposed structure demonstrates excellent tolerance to manufacturing errors.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a family of X-ray dark-field retrieval approaches on a common set of samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitive to scattering from unresolved sample structures, the dark-field channel in full-field X-ray imaging provides complementary information to that offered by conventional attenuation and phase-contrast methods. A range of experimental dark-field techniques and retrieval algorithms have been recently developed to extract this signal by directly resolving dark-field-associated local image blurring with a high-resolution camera. While the underlying physical mechanism that generates dark-field contrast is generally defined similarly across the methods, no comparison of these dark-field techniques using identical samples has been conducted. In this paper, dark-field imaging data from two samples were acquired using three emerging dark-field setups at a synchrotron: propagation-based, single-grid, and speckle-based X-ray imaging. Dark-field images were then reconstructed using a variety of retrieval algorithms--some requiring only a single sample exposure, others multiple; some performing local, pixel-wise analysis, and others operating globally on entire images. We find that the dominant contribution to dark-field contrast--arising from diffuse scattering from unresolved microstructures or multiple refractions through larger, potentially resolved structures--is consistently recovered across all approaches, demonstrating mutual agreement. However, some differences emerge for structures that are spatially varying. We attribute these differences to the idea that each technique has a different internal ruler, a sensitivity scale for dark-field retrieval influenced by both the experimental design and algorithmic assumptions of the technique. This study is intended to guide dark-field imaging users in selecting the most appropriate technique for their imaging goals and to motivate future research into dark-field sensitivity and sources of dark-field contrast across different methods.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic ultrawideband real-time spectrum sensing for 6G wireless networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks require dynamic spectrum management to optimize the utilization of scarce spectral resources and support emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. This necessitates real-time spectrum sensing (RT-SS) capability with ultrawide measurement range, compact size, and low latency. Conventional electronic RT-SS solutions face critical challenges in operating across the millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz bands, which are essential spectra for 6G wireless. While photonic RT-SS has the potential to surpass this limitation, the current implementations feature limited bandwidths below 50 GHz and mostly rely on bulky dispersive fibers with high latency. Here, we address these challenges by developing an integrated photonic RT-SS system capable of ultrabroadband measurement from microwave to sub-terahertz bands, covering the full spectrum for 6G wireless. The photonic RT-SS circuit integrates a broadband electro-optic (EO) modulator for unknown signal loading, an EO tunable microring filter bank for high-speed parallel frequency-to-time mapping, as well as an EO comb for precise channel frequency referencing, all realized on a single thin-film lithium niobate chip. We achieve an unprecedented spectral measurement range beyond 120 GHz at a low latency of less than 100 ns. To validate the effectiveness of our photonic RT-SS system in future 6G scenes, we further propose a heuristic spectro-temporal resource allocation algorithm and conduct a proof-of-concept ISAC demonstration, where a radar adaptively access RT-SS-informed spectrally underutilized regions for high-quality target sensing under dynamic communication interferences. Our work presents a compact and cost-effective solution for efficient spectrum sharing and dynamic management in future 6G ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Normalized Ensemble-Averaged OAM Spectrum in Disordered Statistical Q-Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an exact, analytical derivation of the ensemble-averaged orbital angular momentum (OAM) power spectrum for a circularly polarized Gaussian beam traversing a statistical Q-plate with Gaussian spatial disorder. Utilizing the Gaussian moment theorem, a new closed-form expression for the averaged mutual coherence is obtained. This coherence function is then rigorously projected onto OAM modes, yielding an exactly normalized series representation whose absolute convergence is formally proven. The analysis meticulously resolves limiting disorder regimes: for coarse disorder, an ideal OAM spectrum, sharply peaked at its nominal OAM mode, is demonstrated. Conversely, for fine disorder, a specific fraction of total power exponentially decays with disorder variance into the nominal OAM mode, with remaining power distributed among nearby OAM modes, exhibiting an effective width inversely proportional to the dimensionless correlation length. Crucially, a new universal scaling framework, defined by a master control parameter and a universal coordinate, is introduced. This framework, rigorously derived from the exact solution, unifies the spectrum's description across all relevant disorder regimes and enables robust data collapse. Monte Carlo simulations, implemented with the same normalization and OAM projection, substantiate these claims by corroborating the predicted scaling and universal behavior, offering a foundational, device-level perspective on OAM universality in complex media.</description>

      <title>Free-form conformal metasurfaces robustly generating topological skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topologically stable vector textures as potential information carriers for high-density data storage and communications, especially boosted by the recently emerging meta-generators of skyrmions in electromagnetic fields. However, these implementations always rely on planar, rigid designs with stringent fabrication requirements. Here, we propose the free-form conformal metasurface generating skyrmions towards future wearable and flexible devises for topological resilience light fields. Furthermore, we experimentally tested the outstanding topological robustness of the skyrmion number under different disorder degrees on the metasurface. This work promotes the development of flexible compact skyrmion-based communication devices and demonstrates their potential to improve the quality of space information transmission.</description>

      <title>Optical Fiber-Waveguide Hybrid Architecture for Mid-Infrared Ring Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a mid-infrared ring laser via fiber-to-waveguide hybrid integration enabled by directional couplers fabricated in fluoride glasses. Directional couplers were inscribed into fluoride glass using femtosecond laser direct writing, forming low-loss waveguides with a high positive refractive index change. The waveguides were optimized for efficient guidance at a wavelength of 2.7 {\textmu}m. Directional couplers with systematically varied coupling gap and interaction lengths were fabricated and experimentally characterized, demonstrating controllable power splitting ratios spanning from complete transmission (100:0) to balanced coupling (50:50). A directional coupler with a 7 {\textmu}m coupling gap and a 1.5 mm interaction length, providing an 80:20 power splitting ratio, was integrated with a cladding-pumped Er:ZBLAN fiber to realize a ring laser cavity. The resulting device produced stable lasing at 2716.7 nm with an output power of 14.2 mW. This work represents the first realization of a fully fiber-chip integrated mid-infrared laser source and opens new avenues for 3D photonic integration in fluoride glasses, enabling design flexibility previously unattainable in traditional fiber-optics architectures.</description>

      <title>Harnessing modal fields retrieved from speckle for multi-dimensional metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although speckle is a powerful tool for high-precision metrology, large datasets and cumbersome training are always required to learn from the encoded speckle patterns, which is unfavorable for rapid deployment and multi-dimensional metrology. To enable high accuracy and fast training, physics-informed machine learning enforces physical laws to address high-dimensional problems. Here, we harness the modal fields in a few-mode fiber, which follow the law of beam propagation, to enable high-accuracy and fast-training parameter estimation. Anti-noise fast mode decomposition is implemented to retrieve the modal fields from the speckles. The accuracy is enhanced since the modal fields enable parameter estimation at random points in the continuous space-time domain. Artificial tactile perception and multi-dimensional metrology are achieved with high accuracy because the modal fields respond diversely to different parameters. Meanwhile, the number of specklegrams for training is reduced by around 5 times. The training time of machine learning is significantly reduced by 800 times, from 9 hours and 45 minutes to 40 seconds. Therefore, harnessing the modal fields paves a new way for the speckle-based metrology to develop efficient, low-cost, multi-dimensional sensors, making it suitable for intelligent wearable devices, industrial robots and healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Thin-film Al0.30Ga0.70As (111) as a flat source of high-purity orthogonally polarized entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-optics platforms offer new opportunities for the generation of entangled photons by relaxing traditional phase-matching constraints, enabling the use of a broader range of nonlinear materials. Among these, gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide stand out for their exceptionally high second-order nonlinearities, but their conventional orientation (001) has limited their applicability for photon-pair generation. By transitioning to crystals with (111) surface orientation, we overcome these limitations. We demonstrate a flat-optics-based telecom-range SPDC source using Al0.30Ga0.70As that achieves a high photon-pair generation rate per pump power and bandwidth of up to 0.24 Hz/mW/nm. The choice of 30% aluminum concentration allowed us to reduce pump absorption and photoluminescence background for photon pairs generation at telecom wavelengths by at least an order of magnitude compared to that of GaAs. The specific layer orientation facilitates the generation of orthogonally polarized entangled photons, a prerequisite for polarization-entangled states. Rather than directly probing entanglement, we observe the effect of hidden polarization. Our results highlight AlGaAs (111) as a promising platform for scalable quantum photonic sources and shed light on nonclassical polarization effects accessible through flat-optics engineering.</description>

      <title>Enhanced intraband absorption in two-step photon upconversion solar cells with a double-tunnel-junction structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-step photon upconversion solar cells (TPU-SCs) belong to the class of solar cells that in principle can exceed the Shockley--Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a narrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR) photons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity leads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced upconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum, and quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates in actual devices. In this study, we added an n--p--n double-tunnel-junction structure to an $\mathrm{Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As}$/GaAs TPU-SC including a QD layer to further enhance the contribution of intraband absorption to the output current. The double-tunnel-junction structure should suppress carrier recombination at the heterointerface and improve the extraction efficiency of electrons after intraband absorption. We performed two-color excitation experiments using IR and 784-nm light, and we particularly found that 784-nm light causes a significant amount of intraband transitions in this device. By employing rate equations, we clarify that this result demonstrates a higher intraband absorption efficiency due to the double-tunnel-junction structure. This highlights the potential of double-tunnel-junction structures for the realization of high-efficiency TPU-SCs.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale optically driven phononic frequency comb with 1-70 GHz span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phononic frequency comb consists of equally spaced components in the mechanical frequency domain and holds promise for numerous applications. Yet, prior demonstrations have been limited in spectral range due to the inherently low mechanical frequencies. In this work, we report a phononic comb with a record span from 1 to 70 GHz. This result is achieved by harnessing the strong mechanical nonlinearity of a $2.5$-$\mu$m-radius silicon carbide microdisk, which supports a radial breathing mode at $1.655$ GHz with a mechanical quality factor of 13,500. With just 1 mW of dropped optical power, radiation pressure from a continuous-wave pump drives strong phonon lasing, generating 42 phase-locked harmonics with $1.655$ GHz spacing. The combination of such broad bandwidth, low phase noise (-132 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency) and frequency stability ($&lt;10^{-7}$ at 1 second of averaging time) positions this ultracompact phononic comb as a powerful platform for diverse applications.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of deep learning into the field of single-pixel imaging has garnered significant attention. However, traditional networks often operate within the pixel space. To address this, we innovatively migrate single-pixel imaging to the latent space, naming this framework LSSPI (Latent Space Single-Pixel Imaging). Within the latent space, we conduct in-depth explorations into both reconstruction and generation tasks for single-pixel imaging. Notably, this approach significantly enhances imaging capabilities even under low sampling rate conditions. Compared to conventional deep learning networks, LSSPI not only reconstructs images with higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and richer details under equivalent sampling rates but also enables blind denoising and effective recovery of high-frequency information. Furthermore, by migrating single-pixel imaging to the latent space, LSSPI achieves superior advantages in terms of model parameter efficiency and reconstruction speed. Its excellent computational efficiency further positions it as an ideal solution for low-sampling single-pixel imaging applications, effectively driving the practical implementation of single-pixel imaging technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) plays a crucial role in constructing seamless interconnection between quantum systems operating at different wavelengths. To advance future quantum technology, chip-scale integrated QFC components, featuring high efficiency, small footprint, low power consumption and high scalability, are indispensable. In this work, we demonstrate the first hybrid integrated QFC chip on thin film lithium niobate platform that connects the telecom and visible bands. Benefiting from the periodically poled microring resonator with ulta-high normalized conversion efficiency of 386,000 %/W, an ultra-low pump power of 360 {\mu}W is achieved which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than traditional straight waveguide scheme. By injecting current into the chip, an on-chip quantum efficiency of 57% and a noise count of ~ 7k counts per second are achieved. Such an electrically pumped, integrated and scalable QFC chip would significantly advancing the integration of quantum network and the development of chip-scale quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Photon Correlations in Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a scattering theory formalism and use it to predict that a resonantly driven atomic ensemble weakly coupled to an optical mode can generate light with non-Gaussian correlations. Our approach -- based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion of multi-photon interactions -- shows that photon-photon interaction mediated by the emitters causes the transmitted light to have a non-vanishing connected third-order correlation function $g_c^{(3)}$. We explain the temporal pattern of $g_c^{(3)}$ using the interaction processes in our diagrammatic expansion. A quantitative comparison with cascaded master equation simulations for small ensembles with optical depth $\mathrm{OD}\leq 2$ confirms that the perturbative results remain accurate across experimentally relevant optical depths and for drive strengths large enough to make the predicted non-Gaussian signatures detectable. We anticipate that state-of-the-art nanofibre-coupled atomic ensembles can experimentally demonstrate our predictions.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Induced Topological Phase Transition Investigated by Helicity Dependent Photocurrent in $\alpha$-Sn/CdTe(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Sn exhibits a rich topological phase diagram, yet experimental methods to tune and distinguish these phases remain limited. Here, we investigated the helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC) in $\alpha$-Sn films of varying thickness grown on CdTe(110) by molecular beam epitaxy. The HDPC of the 5 nm $\alpha$-Sn film shows an odd-function dependence on incident angle, whereas that of the 10 and 30 nm films exhibit an even-function dependence. Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, it is revealed that a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a two dimensional (2D) to a three dimensional (3D) topological insulator occurs between 5 and 10 nm. These results demonstrate that HDPC serves as a sensitive diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions. The tunable electronic properties of $\alpha$-Sn(110) films enable thickness- and strain-mediated control of topological states, establishing a versatile platform for exploring emerging topological phenomena and developing spin-based devices.</description>

      <title>Multiple Scattering Effects in Noctilucent Clouds: Numerical Estimation and Application to Altitude and Particle Size Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simple 3-D radiative transfer model in the atmosphere of the Earth is built for numerical comparison of direct solar radiation and limb scattering background at the definite layer during the deep twilight period at the middle and upper atmosphere. This allows finding the contribution of multiple scattering in the field of high-altitude clouds such as polar stratospheric and noctilucent clouds. This is the factor that can influence the results of altitude and microphysical study of the particles based on the approximation of single scattering. The possible errors caused by this effect are estimated together with the contribution of multiple scattering for different altitudes of the clouds, wavelengths and solar zenith angles. The results are interpreted geometrically and optically, color effects observed for noctilucent clouds are described.</description>

      <title>Wavefront correction of high-dimensional two-photon states via coherence-entanglement transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable transmission of quantum optical states through real-world environments is key for quantum communication and imaging. Yet, aberrations and scattering in the propagation path can scramble the transmitted signal and hinder its use. A typical strategy is to employ a classical beacon beam to learn and then correct for the wavefront distortions. However, relying on a separate light source increases the overhead in the experimental apparatus. Moreover, the beacon light must closely match the non-classical state in polarization, wavelength, and even temporal bandwidth, which is highly challenging in practice. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient wavefront correction approach where we use the quantum state itself to correct for optical distortion. Via pump shaping, we control the degree of entanglement in the spatially-entangled two-photon state so that it behaves either as a high-dimensional entangled state or as a classical coherent state. The latter case is used to efficiently measure the transmission matrix of the propagation channel and correct its distortions with a spatial light modulator, thereby enabling the transmission of the high-dimensional entangled state with minimal errors. Our approach paves the way for the practical implementation of quantum imaging and communication protocols based on high-dimensional spatially entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling energy transfer mechanisms in rare-earth-doped nanomaterials is essential for advancing luminescent technologies used in bioimaging, optical thermometry, and solid-state lasers. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence dynamics of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in Y2O3 nanoparticles over a wide concentration range (0.5-17%), using both direct and upconversion excitation. Luminescence decays of green, red, and near-infrared transitions were measured and analyzed using a rate-equation model incorporating radiative and non-radiative processes, energy transfer mechanisms, and defect-related quenching. The model successfully reproduces experimental trends across most concentrations and excitation paths. This work provides a reliable and predictive framework for modeling energy transfer in rare-earth doped materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing photoluminescent properties in nanostructured systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving low contact resistance in advanced quantum electronic devices remains a critical challenge. With the growing demand for faster and energy-efficient devices, 2D contact engineering offers a promising solution. Beyond graphene, 1T-WTe2 has attracted attention for its excellent electrical transport, quantum phenomena, and Weyl semimetallic properties. Here, we demonstrate the direct wafer-scale growth of 1T-WTe2 via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and its use as a 2D contact for layered materials such as InSe. The 1T WTe2/InSe interface exhibits a barrier height nearly half that of conventional metal contacts, and its contact resistance is reduced by a factor of 21, effectively suppressing Fermi level pinning and enabling efficient electron injection. InSe/1T WTe2 photodetectors show broad photoresponsivity (0.14 to 217.58 A/W) under NIR to DUV illumination with fast rise/fall times of 42/126 ms, compared to lower responsivity (0.000865 A/W to 3.64 A/W) and slower response (150/144 ms) for InSe/Ti Au devices. The 1T WTe2/InSe devices thus exhibit approximately 60 times higher responsivity and 4 times faster response than conventional metal contacts. These results establish MBE-grown 1T-WTe2 as an effective 2D electrode, enhancing photodetection performance while simplifying device architecture, making it a strong candidate for next generation nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We propose a general scheme to investigate photon triplet generation (PTG) via third-order spontaneous parametric downconversion (TOSPDC) in $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear structures. Our approach leverages the quantum-classical correspondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave sum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply this framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of non-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict wavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations. These findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight the potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon triplet sources with quantum state control.</description>

The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving super-resolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Dielectric environment engineering via 2D material heterostructure formation on hybrid photonic crystal nanocavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.</description>

Abstract: A contactless control of mean values and fluctuations of position and velocity of a nanoobject belongs among the key methods needed for ultra-precise nanotechnology and the upcoming quantum technology of macroscopic systems. An analysis of experimental implementations of such a control, including assessments of linearity and the effects of added noise, is required. Here, we present a protocol of linear amplification of mean values and fluctuations along an arbitrary phase space variable and squeezing along the complementary one, referred to as a nanomechanical state amplifier. It utilizes the experimental platform of a single optically levitating nanoparticle and the three-step protocol combines a controlled fast switching of the parabolic trapping potential to an inverted parabolic potential and back to the parabolic potential. The protocol can be sequentially repeated or extended to shape the nanomechanical state appropriately. Experimentally, we achieve amplification of position with a gain of $|G| \simeq 2$ and a classical squeezing coefficient above 4 dB in as short a timestep as one period of nanoparticle oscillations ($7.6\,\mu$s). Amplification in velocity, with the same parameters, squeezes the input noise and enhances force sensing.</description>

      <title>Topological Pathways to Two-Dimensional Quantum Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels still face various challenges, including slow speed, labor-intensive operations, resolution and accuracy constraints or interruptions to solar field operations. We present a rapid, cost-effective, and non-intrusive method for mirror soiling detection based on polarimetric imaging, referred to as Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS). The compact PIMS device is designed for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling rapid, large-area assessments of heliostat mirrors for efficient soiling detection. Our method utilizes the correlation between the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and surface soiling level based on Mie scattering theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Field deployment of the PIMS method requires minimal device installation, and its UAV-based operation allows for soiling detection without interrupting plant activities. The PIMS method holds the potential for mirror soiling detection across various concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and can be further adapted for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic trough systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Plasmon Interaction in Nanoparticle Assemblies: Role of the Dipole-Quadrupole Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of metallic nanoparticle assemblies is nowadays well-controlled, such that these systems offer the possibility of controlling light at a sub-wavelength scale, thanks, for instance, to surface plasmons. Determining the energy dispersion of plasmons likely to couple to light within these nanostructures is, therefore, a necessary preliminary task on the way to understanding both their photonic properties and their physical nature, namely the role of the quadrupole contribution. Starting with a general model that takes account of all energy modes, we show that its low-lying energy dispersion gained numerically, can be compared to that of a minimal model that treats dipoles and quadrupoles on the same footing. The main advantage of the latter relies on the fact that its formulation is tractable, such that a semi-analytical Bogoliubov transformation allows one to access the experimentally relevant energy bands. Based on this semi-analytical derivation, we determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the dipole-only model, the presently proposed dipole and quadrupole model, compared to a full-plasmon-mode Hamiltonian. The results show that the dispersion relation, which includes dipoles and quadrupoles, is sufficient to capture the low-energy physics at play in most experimental situations. Besides, we show that at small lattice spacing, the contribution of quadrupoles is dominant around the Brillouin zone center.</description>

      <title>Heliostat Optical Error Inspection with Polarimetric Imaging Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) field, optical errors have significant impacts on the collection efficiency of heliostats. Fast, cost-effective, labor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a challenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been developed to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often limited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based method with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging contrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field operation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to simulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized waypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with enhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success rate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge detection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to achieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and investigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with existing imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging Heliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest that the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for real-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable for non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.</description>

      <title>Microscopic magnetic field imaging with hot atoms via single-pixel imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, sensors based on hot atomic vapor cells have emerged as a compact and highly sensitive means of measuring magnetic fields. Such sensors have been deployed in the field for the measurement of, e.g. biological systems, representing a promising practical application of quantum technologies. However, it remains challenging to obtain high-resolution magnetic field images from these sensors, and in most cases the spatial resolution of the system is limited by the sensor size. Here, we demonstrate the combination of single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques with an atom vapor. Faraday magnetometer to achieve microscopic magnetic field imaging. We demonstrate magnetic field imaging with a spatial resolution of $\approx~62.5\mu m$, limited only by the resolution of our DMD projection system and the absence of magnetic shielding in our experimental setup.</description>
