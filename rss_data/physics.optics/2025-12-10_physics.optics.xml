      <title>Normal form computation of nonlinear dispersion relationship for locally resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the application of the parametrisation method for invariant manifold with a complex normal form style (CNF), for the derivation of high-order approximations of underdamped nonlinear dispersion relationships for periodic structures, more specifically by considering the case of a locally resonant metamaterial chain incorporating damping and various nonlinear stiffnesses. Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures.</description>

      <title>Measuring the group velocity dispersion in near resonant hot atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group velocity dispersion (GVD) in near-resonant hot atomic vapors is difficult to measure with standard pulse broadening or interferometric techniques, as absorption, pulse distortion and nonlinearities strongly affect the probe and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce a simpler method using a continuous-wave laser with weak phase modulation and a slow photodetector, directly inspired by Bragg-like spectroscopy in fluids of light. During propagation, the red and blue-detuned sidebands accumulate different dispersive phase shifts, leading to oscillations in the transmitted modulation contrast as the modulation frequency is scanned. Vanishing contrast at well-defined frequencies directly yields the GVD. We apply this technique to hot rubidium vapors and observe the strong frequency dependence of the GVD across a broad detuning range of the D2 line at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Watt-level second harmonic generation in periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental tool in modern laser technology, enabling coherent frequency conversion to remote optical bands, serving as the basis for self-referenced femtosecond lasers and quadrature-squeezed light sources. State-of-the-art SHG relies on bulk crystals and ridge waveguides, although continuous-wave (CW) SH efficiency in bulk crystals is limited by short interaction lengths and large mode areas. Ridge waveguides offer better performance with lower pump power requirements, yet must span several centimeters to deliver high output power, complicating fabrication and narrowing the bandwidth. Recently, SHG in periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonic circuits has attracted significant interest, offering orders-of-magnitude improvement in SHG under CW pumping due to the stronger optical mode confinement. However, lithium niobate has a low optical damage threshold, even in MgO-doped substrates, which limits SH power output to well below the watt level. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate 7 mm-long periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PPLT) waveguides that achieve high SH output in the CW regime, with generated power exceeding 1 W and off-chip output above 0.5 W at 775 nm under 4.5 W pump power. PPLT offers a higher optical damage threshold than PPLN and supports watt-level operation. By optimizing electrode geometry and poling conditions, we obtain reproducible poling despite lithium tantalate's coercive field being nearly four times higher than that of MgO-doped lithium niobate. Although its effective nonlinearity is more than five times lower, we achieve watt-level CW output with a short waveguide, demonstrating the potential of PPLT circuits for high-power applications in integrated lasers, quantum photonics, AMO physics, optical clocks, and frequency metrology.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Metalenses for Generalizable Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) are gaining increasing attention to accelerate machine learning tasks. In particular, static meta-optical encoders designed for task-specific pre-processing demonstrated orders of magnitude smaller energy consumption over purely digital counterpart, albeit at the cost of slight degradation in classification accuracy. However, a lack of generalizability poses serious challenges for wide deployment of static meta-optical front-ends. Here, we investigate the utility of a metalens for generalized computer vision. Specifically, we show that a metalens optimized for full-color imaging can achieve image classification accuracy comparable to high-end, sensor-limited optics and consistently outperforms a hyperboloid metalens across a wide range of sensor pixel sizes. We further design an end-to-end single aperture metasurface for ImageNet classification and find that the optimized metasurface tends to balance the modulation transfer function (MTF) for each wavelength. Together, these findings highlight that the preservation of spatial frequency-domain information is an essential interpretable factor underlying ONN performance. Our work provides both an interpretable understanding of task-driven optical optimization and practical guidance for designing high-performance ONNs and meta-optical encoders for generalizable computer vision.</description>

      <title>FRINGE: a protocol for self-referenced quantum state estimation via photon-number-resolved interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a self-referenced method for quantum-state tomography of light based on photon-number-resolved double-slit interferometry. Two identical copies of the unknown quantum field illuminate laterally displaced slits, guaranteeing perfect spatiotemporal mode matching without a separate local oscillator. In the far-field, detection at transverse position $x$ is associated with a relative slit phase $\phi(x)$, and an $N$-photon event projects the detected quantum field onto a state $|N;\phi(x)\rangle$. The resulting distribution $P(N,\phi)$ is the quantum analogue of a Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) trace: whereas FROG reconstructs the classical complex spectral field $E(\omega)$ from a spectrally resolved second harmonic of a pulse with its delayed self, our measurement reconstructs the Fock-space wavefunction or density matrix from binomially weighted self-interference. The scheme requires no known or mode-matched reference and is compatible with commercially available photon-number-resolving cameras. Beyond conceptual simplicity and automatic mode matching, the FROG analogy permits direct transfer of mature ultrafast-optics methodologies (e.g., mixed-state, ptychographic, and vectorial extensions) into quantum optics, offering a versatile route to tomography of quantum photon states.</description>

      <title>Laser-assisted deposition of carbon nanotubes in optical fibers with multiparameter control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new method to deposit carbon nanotubes (CNT) on optical fibers based on a syringe-loaded CNT solution axially aligned to the fiber tip. A laser generates an optical tweezer in a water-based CNT solution, depositing nanotubes over the fiber cross-section. The parameters are adjusted, resulting in two deposited CNT layers with distinct thicknesses. This setup employs smaller solution volumes than those commonly used in beckers, providing high confinement, protection, and interaction of nanotubes, laser, and fiber, offering a promising alternative for real-time monitoring, which are significant to the development of industrial fiber lasers and biomedical optoacoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity tensor dynamics of in-plane hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2 and emergent chiral photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) crystals offer unique opportunities for modern nanophotonic applications owing to their intrinsic anisotropic nature. While most of them exhibit uniaxial anisotropy arising from weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, some of their representative families also exhibit an in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric). Here, we present an accurate dynamics of dielectric permittivity tensor components of vdW MoOCl2 in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) spectral region partly covering near-infrared (NIR). Addressing its enormously anisotropic optical constants, we focus on another hyperbolicity window of vdW MoOCl2 emerging in the UV spectral region that may potentially unlock rich light-matter interaction effects. Furthermore, we propose an approach towards designing nanoscale handedness preserved Vis light circular polarizers based on twisted helical vdW MoOCl2 heterostructures. Our findings display that vdW MoOCl2 provides a highly promising platform not only for hyperbolic, but also for chiral nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Laser-pumped drilling carbon nanotube vortex shock waves in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate laser-induced vortex shock waves formed by carbon nanotubes drilling optical fibers for the first time. Three samples of standard single-mode optical fibers (SMF) are sequentially inserted in a syringe loaded with a 1 mL solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and methanol, and a high-power laser is injected into the fibers for 5 (SMF 1), 10 (SMF 2), and 20 (SMF 3) minutes. The CNT solution thermally expands and generates vortex acoustic flows, which are confined in the syringe cavity, significantly increasing the velocity and impact of nanotubes at the fiber tip. The resulting shock waves achieve estimated hypersonic velocities (5742 m/s) and high pressures (6.7 GPa), overcoming the silica tensile strength and ablating structured vortices in the fibers. The material, geometry, and depth profile of the vortices are characterized, providing details of mixing carbon and silica layers, increasing radially from the fiber core center and in thickness to the cladding for longer laser periods (850 nm to 10 micron thickness). The cross-sections of the measured vortices are compared to analytical simulations, revealing unprecedented Fibonacci helices drilling holes in the fiber core with a 5 micron maximum depth, while depositing nanoscale CNT-silica layers following Fibonacci spirals. These achievements point out a new route for laser-controlled deposition of nanoparticles and fabrication of vortex devices on fiber tips, which is promising for all-fiber vortex spatial phase modulators in optical communications, fiber sensors, high-power pulsed fiber lasers, and biomedical ultrasonic neurotransmitters.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dependent Enhancement of Magnetic Dipolar Emission with Silicon Nanodimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eu(TTA)3 complexes are used as an emission source in the presence of high refrac- tive index dielectric nanostructures. These nanostructures support Mie-type resonances that modify the local density of optical states. Specifically, the silicon dimer provides polarization-dependent electric and magnetic field enhancement in the dimer gap to modify the electric dipolar and magnetic dipolar emissions of the Eu3+ at 610 nm and 590 nm, respectively. Finite element method simulations are used to determine the opti- mal parameters for the sample and to demonstrate the polarization-dependent emission enhancement of dipolar emitters in the gap. A two-step electron beam lithography pro- cess is used to fabricate the hybrid nanoscopic structures, with a Eu3+ doped electron beam resist located only in the center of the dimer. The results demonstrate the po- tential of these nanostructures to selectively tailor the emission of the two distinct dipolar transitions by engineering the resonant nanostructures. Our work highlights the potential of magnetic light-matter interactions as a novel degree of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light scattering by spherical-shaped particles of sizes comparable to the wavelength is foundational in many areas of science, from chemistry to atmospheric science, photonics and nanotechnology. With the new capabilities offered by machine learning, there is a great interest in end-to-end differentiable frameworks for scattering calculations. Here we introduce PyMieDiff, a fully differentiable, GPU-compatible implementation of Mie scattering for core-shell particles in PyTorch. The library provides native, autograd-compatible spherical Bessel and Hankel functions, vectorized evaluation of Mie coefficients, and APIs for computing efficiencies, angular scattering, and near-fields. All inputs - geometry, material dispersion, wavelengths, and observation angles and positions - are represented as tensors, enabling seamless integration with gradient-based optimisation or physics-informed neural networks. The toolkit can also be combined with "TorchGDM" for end-to-end differentiable multi-particle scattering simulations. PyMieDiff is available under an open source licence at https://github.com/UoS-Integrated-Nanophotonics-group/MieDiff.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based optimization of scatterer arrangements based on the T-Matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for inverse design is increasing as the ability to fabricate sub-10 nm features expands the design space by orders of magnitude. Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs. In the second example, a metasurface made from multiple scatterers in each unit cell is designed to maximize the reflectance contrast between orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident light. We make the framework publicly available at https://github.com/tfp-photonics/dreams.</description>

      <title>Topological Braiding and Dynamic Probing of Phase Transitions at Temporal Interfaces in Non-Hermitian Synthetic Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems give rise to distinct topological phenomena, yet their manifestations at temporal interfaces characterized by abrupt changes in system parameters remain largely unex plored. Upon an abrupt alteration of the Hamiltonian in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian sys tem,the ensuring temporal interface excites both reflected and refracted wave modes. By intro ducing a chiral-symmetric Hamiltonian, this study reveals the topological effects at such temporal interfaces. We find that the reflection and refraction coefficients exhibit a topological braiding struc ture. This structure is directly determined by the difference in the topological invariants across the interface, establishing a bulk-boundary correspondence for temporal interfaces in non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we propose a dynamical probe that leverages the geometric similarity of eigenstates at the temporal interface to detect topological phase transitions. These findings estab lish a fundamental connection between topological braiding and nonreciprocal dynamics at temporal interfaces, providing a platform to explore phase transition detection and nonreciprocal phenomena in time-varying non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facilitated by low-noise laser frequency locking, optical microresonators with the Pockels effect have shown unprecedented high resolutions in sensing electrical field. However, the requirement for tunable and low-noise laser sources considerably increases the cost and the size of the system, thereby limiting the industrial applicability of the microresonator-based technology. Here, we explore the possibility of using a low-cost fixed-frequency semiconductor laser as the pump laser to perform radiofrequency electrometry. A resonant mode in a lithium niobate microresonator is frequency-locked to the laser using the electrooptic effect. This same effect also underlies the radiofrequency electric-field sensing mechanism. Our experimental results show that the electrometry resolution can be maintained at signal frequencies beyond the optical resonance bandwidth and that the signal-to-noise ratio does not change with varied coupling conditions as long as the laser frequency noise is the dominant noise source of the system. In addition, narrowband electrooptic sensitivity enhancement is observed at frequencies of the microresonator's piezoelectric resonances, resulting in a resolution enhancement factor of approximately 3 at signal frequencies around 4 MHz. Our work advances the photonic resonant electrometry technology by studying the bandwidth limitation, and opens the road to the employment of low-cost lasers in high-resolution sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-wavelength Fourier Ptychographic Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dual-wavelength Fourier ptychographic topography (FPT) method that extends the lambda/2 height-range limit of single-wavelength FPT. By reconstructing complex fields at two illumination wavelengths and exploiting their phase difference, the method achieves an effective synthetic wavelength lambda_s and an unambiguous range of lambda_s/2 without reducing lateral resolution. A noise-robust wrapped-number search is used to select per-pixel integer pairs (k1, k2), and a global refinement with circular TV regularization and soft bounds improves stability and preserves height discontinuities. The approach is validated through rigorous scattering-model-based simulations and experiments on structured silicon samples, demonstrating accurate height recovery in regimes where single-wavelength FPT exhibits phase wrapping. We analyze the limits of the FPT forward model and identify aspect ratio (AR) and phase modulation transfer function (ph-MTF) as key predictors of reconstruction fidelity. Simulations and experiments show that increasing AR beyond a practical threshold causes loss of high-frequency phase transfer and destabilizes dual-wavelength unwrapping. Within this AR range, dual-wavelength FPT provides robust, high-resolution topography suitable for semiconductor and industrial metrology.</description>

      <title>Strong Mode Coupling via Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum in Bianisotropic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic mode coupling plays a key role in many resonant effects in nanophotonics. This coupling is also responsible for the appearance of bianisotropy, where electric and magnetic responses become interconnected through the interaction of their respective modes. In this work, we develop a simple and general temporal coupled-mode theory model to describe off-diagonal chiral bianisotropy. Using quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs), we demonstrate how to control the hybridization of modes with opposite symmetries, resulting in Rabi-like splitting between the hybrid states in the regime of strong electromagnetic mode coupling. Beyond revealing the physical origin of the hybrid modes, our model predicts and explains the emergence of dual-band asymmetric reflection and absorption, and how to achieve maximum directional absorption difference. The theoretical predictions are verified by full-wave simulations, showing very good agreement with theory. Furthermore, very strong reciprocal bianisotropy is demonstrated with the use of q-BICs in a deeply subwavelength metasurface in the optical frequency range. Our results provide a clear physical picture of the interaction process between modes, offering a compact theoretical framework for understanding and designing bianisotropic dielectric metasurfaces not only in the traditional regime but also in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Photon Phase-Space Dynamics in a Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency up-shifting of laser light in a beam-driven plasma wakefield has the potential to provide high-intensity sources of short wavelength radiation. Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake- phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions.
  The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics.
  These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <title>Tunable passive squeezing of squeezed light through unbalanced double homodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full characterization of quantum states of light is a central task in quantum optics and information science. Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric cavity magnomechanics with gain-assisted transparency and amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.</description>

Abstract: The Michelson interferometric phase detection resolution can be enhanced by replacing conventional beam splitters with novel directionally unbiased four-port scatterers, such as Grover coins. We present a quantitative analysis of the noise-to-signal ratio of sideband frequencies generated by gravitational wave-induced phase perturbations in a Grover-Michelson interferometer (GMI). We discuss the principles of GMI signal enhancement and demonstrate how combining this configuration with additional light-recycling arrangements further enhances the performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum microcombs generated in high-Q microresonators provide compact, multiplexed sources of entangled modes for continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. While deterministic generation of CV states via Kerr-induced two-mode squeezing has been demonstrated, achieving spectrally uniform squeezing remains challenging because of asymmetry and anomalies in the dispersion profile. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental to many applications of laser pulses in science and technology is an extended interaction length with matter that significantly exceeds the distance over which the pulse would normally diffract and transversely spread. At low intensity, the interaction could simply be the linear refraction provided by a glass optical fiber to keep the pulse from spreading. At increased pulse intensity, more than diffraction-free pulse transport is of interest: an extended interaction length of high intensity light can give rise to bright secondary sources of photons, and at relativistic intensities, beams of high energy charged particles. As generation of these secondary sources requires laser intensities well above the threshold for ionization of atoms, new methods for defeating pulse diffraction in a plasma have been developed. Chief among them are plasma waveguides: optical fibers composed of plasma that have characteristic mode structure. This article reviews the methods and theory of plasma waveguides, highlighting the recent development of meter-scale plasma waveguides that have been instrumental to the laser acceleration of high charge electron beams to ~10 GeV.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have established and rigorously validated a modified Langevin noise formalism that enables first-principles quantization of electromagnetic fields in open and dissipative environments [1,2,3]. Building on this foundation, a fully quantum-mechanical multimode Jaynes-Cummings framework has been developed and verified, providing an accurate description of atom--field interactions in lossy and radiative systems [4]. In this work, we explore the potential of this formalism for nanophotonic applications by modeling representative quantum-plasmonic dynamics. In particular, we present detailed numerical examples for (i) two-photon interference mediated by a quantum plasmonic beam splitter, and (ii) non-Markovian dynamics of an atom located in plasmonic antennas and directional control of out-coupled single-photon fields. These results demonstrate that the proposed modeling approach can be directly used to guide the design and optimization of plasmonic single-photon sources and beam-splitting structures. Moreover, the framework is broadly applicable to the analysis of linear optical components and cavity quantum electrodynamics problems in open and dissipative photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a new approach to in-situ monitor the altered states of pixels in VO2 based active THz amplitude metagrating by using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generated in LiNbO3 substrate. A single broadband RF response of the SAW device consists of N narrowband frequency channels which code the feedback information on the current pixels states. This way the resistance alteration due to metal-to-insulator transition of all VO2 based pixels of the active THz grating is monitored in advance even without incident radiation. The method provides important new options of monitoring a metasurface aging as well as incorrect switching related to technological defects. Using of the SAW device in all-electrically addressed VO2 based binary grating with tunable period as well as advanced gradient type gratings are modeled.</description>

      <title>VO2 films grown on TiO2 sub-layer: influence of thickness on structural, electrical and optical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide with metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) that is triggered by heat, current or light is a promising material for modern active THz/mid-IR metasurfaces and all-optical big data processing systems. Multilayer VO2-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO2 properties in VO2/TiO2/Al2O3 films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO2 films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO2 layer thickness in VO2/TiO2 composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO2 lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO2 layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO2 thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO2 lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO2 layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO2 films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO2/V2O5 phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO2 films revealed that VO2/V2O5 ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO2 film to be as low as 800 ns.</description>

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product.
  We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives.
  RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>
