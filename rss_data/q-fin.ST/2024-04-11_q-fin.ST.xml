      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Wash Trading of Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the liquidity of an asset includes two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion. We find that the liquidity diffusion has a higher correlation with crypto washing trading than the liquidity jump. We demonstrate that the treatment of washing trading significantly reduces the liquidity diffusion, but only marginally reduces the liquidity jump. We find that the ARMA-GARCH/EGARCH models are highly effective in modeling the liquidity-adjusted return with and without treatment on wash trading. We argue that treatment on wash trading is unnecessary in modeling established crypto assets that trade in mainstream exchanges, even if these exchanges are unregulated.</description>

      <title>Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Diversification-Enhancing Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex financial markets, recommender systems can play a crucial role in empowering individuals to make informed decisions. Existing studies predominantly focus on price prediction, but even the most sophisticated models cannot accurately predict stock prices. Also, many studies show that most individual investors do not follow established investment theories because they have their own preferences. Hence, the tricky point in stock recommendation is that recommendations should give good investment performance but also should not ignore individual preferences. To develop effective stock recommender systems, it is essential to consider three key aspects: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) temporal aspect of both stock features and individual preferences. In response, we develop the portfolio temporal graph network recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing contrastive learning. As a result, our model demonstrated superior performance compared to various baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models, in a sense that our model exhibited good investment performance while maintaining competitive in capturing individual preferences.

      <title>Detection of financial opportunities in micro-blogging data with a stacked classification system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-blogging sources such as the Twitter social network provide valuable real-time data for market prediction models. Investors' opinions in this network follow the fluctuations of the stock markets and often include educated speculations on market opportunities that may have impact on the actions of other investors. In view of this, we propose a novel system to detect positive predictions in tweets, a type of financial emotions which we term "opportunities" that are akin to "anticipation" in Plutchik's theory. Specifically, we seek a high detection precision to present a financial operator a substantial amount of such tweets while differentiating them from the rest of financial emotions in our system. We achieve it with a three-layer stacked Machine Learning classification system with sophisticated features that result from applying Natural Language Processing techniques to extract valuable linguistic information. Experimental results on a dataset that has been manually annotated with financial emotion and ticker occurrence tags demonstrate that our system yields satisfactory and competitive performance in financial opportunity detection, with precision values up to 83%. This promising outcome endorses the usability of our system to support investors' decision making.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of Macroeconomic Policies: A Double Machine Learning Approach to Analyzing Interest Rate Effects on Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the effects of macroeconomic policies on financial markets using a novel approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) techniques and causal inference. It focuses on the effect of interest rate changes made by the US Federal Reserve System (FRS) on the returns of fixed income and equity funds between January 1986 and December 2021. The analysis makes a distinction between actively and passively managed funds, hypothesizing that the latter are less susceptible to changes in interest rates. The study contrasts gradient boosting and linear regression models using the Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, which supports a variety of statistical learning techniques. Results indicate that gradient boosting is a useful tool for predicting fund returns; for example, a 1% increase in interest rates causes an actively managed fund's return to decrease by -11.97%. This understanding of the relationship between interest rates and fund performance provides opportunities for additional research and insightful, data-driven advice for fund managers and investors</description>

      <title>Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions in Competitive Industries: A Model Based on Temporal Dynamics and Industry Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M&amp;A activities are pivotal for market consolidation, enabling firms to augment market power through strategic complementarities. Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&amp;A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&amp;A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&amp;A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&amp;A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&amp;A cases between January 1997 and December 2020. Our approach marks a significant improvement over traditional models by providing detailed insights into M&amp;A activities and strategic recommendations for specific firms.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Structure with Novel Position Mechanism and Improved EMD for Stock Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a branch of time series forecasting, stock movement forecasting is one of the challenging problems for investors and researchers. Since Transformer was introduced to analyze financial data, many researchers have dedicated themselves to forecasting stock movement using Transformer or attention mechanisms. However, existing research mostly focuses on individual stock information but ignores stock market information and high noise in stock data. In this paper, we propose a novel method using the attention mechanism in which both stock market information and individual stock information are considered. Meanwhile, we propose a novel EMD-based algorithm for reducing short-term noise in stock data. Two randomly selected exchange-traded funds (ETFs) spanning over ten years from US stock markets are used to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed attention-based method. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed attention-based method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Signature-based validation of real-world economic scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by insurance applications, we propose a new approach for the validation of real-world economic scenarios. This approach is based on the statistical test developed by Chevyrev and Oberhauser (2022) and relies on the notions of signature and maximum mean distance. This test allows to check whether two samples of stochastic processes paths come from the same distribution. Our contribution is to apply this test to a variety of stochastic processes exhibiting different pathwise properties (H{\"o}lder regularity, autocorrelation, regime switches) and which are relevant for the modelling of stock prices and stock volatility as well as of inflation in view of actuarial applications.</description>

      <title>Visibility graph analysis of crude oil futures markets: Insights from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the significant impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent COVID-19 pandemic on global financial markets, this study conducts a thorough analysis of three key crude oil futures markets: WTI, Brent, and Shanghai (SC). Employing the visibility graph (VG) methodology, we examine both static and dynamic characteristics using daily and high-frequency data. We identified a clear power-law decay in most VG degree distributions and highlighted the pronounced clustering tendencies within crude oil futures VGs. Our results also confirm an inverse correlation between clustering coefficient and node degree and further reveal that all VGs not only adhere to the small-world property but also exhibit intricate assortative mixing. Through the time-varying characteristics of VGs, we found that WTI and Brent demonstrate aligned behavior, while the SC market, with its unique trading mechanics, deviates. The 5-minute VGs' assortativity coefficient provides a deeper understanding of these markets' reactions to the pandemic and geopolitical events. Furthermore, the differential responses during the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflict underline the unique sensitivities of each market to global disruptions. Overall, this research offers profound insights into the structure, dynamics, and adaptability of these essential commodities markets in the face of worldwide challenges.</description>
