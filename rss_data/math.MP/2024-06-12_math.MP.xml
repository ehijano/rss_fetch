      <title>Landscape estimates of the integrated density of states for Jacobi operators on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the integrated density of states for a variety of Jacobi operators on graphs, such as the Anderson model and random hopping models on graphs with Gaussian heat kernel bounds, can be estimated from above and below in terms of the localization landscape counting function. Specific examples of these graphs include stacked and decorated lattices, graphs corresponding to band matrices, and aperiodic tiling graphs. The upper bound part of the landscape law also applies to the fractal Sierpinski gasket graph. As a consequence of the landscape law, we obtain landscape-based proofs of the Lifshitz tails in several models including random band matrix models, certain bond percolation Hamiltonians on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and Jacobi operators on certain stacks of graphs. We also present intriguing numerical simulations exploring the behavior of the landscape counting function across various models.</description>

      <title>Regularized quantum motion in a bounded set: Hilbertian aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the momentum operator canonically conjugated to the position operator for a particle moving in some bounded interval of the line {(with Dirichlet boundary conditions) is not essentially self-adjoint}: it has a continuous set of self-adjoint extensions. We prove that essential self-adjointness can be recovered by symmetrically weighting the momentum operator with a positive bounded function approximating the indicator function of the considered interval. This weighted momentum operator is consistently obtained from a similarly weighted classical momentum through the so-called Weyl-Heisenberg covariant integral quantization of functions or distributions.</description>

      <title>A numerical model for time-multiplexed Ising machines based on delay-line oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines (IM) have recently been proposed as unconventional hardware-based computation accelerators for solving NP-hard problems. In this work, we present a model for a time-multiplexed IM based on the nonlinear oscillations in a delay line-based resonator and numerically study the effects that the circuit parameters, specifically the compression gain $\beta_r$ and frequency nonlinearity $\beta_i$, have on the IM solutions. We find that the likelihood of reaching the global minimum -- the global minimum probability (GMP) -- is the highest for a certain range of $\beta_r$ and $\beta_i$ located near the edge of the synchronization region of the oscillators. The optimal range remains unchanged for all tested coupling topologies and network connections. We also observe a sharp transition line in the ($\beta_i, \beta_r$) space above which the GMP falls to zero. In all cases, small variations in the natural frequency of the oscillators do not modify the results, allowing us to extend this model to realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum MEP hydrodynamical model for charge transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well known procedure to get quantum hydrodynamical models for charge transport is to resort to the Wigner equations and deduce the hierarchy of the moment equations as in the semiclassical approach. If one truncates the moment hierarchy to a finite order, the resulting set of balance equations requires some closure assumption because the number of unknowns exceed the number of equations. In the classical and semiclassical kinetic theory a sound approach to get the desired closure relations is that based on the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) [13] (see[20] for charge transport in semiconductors). In [9] a quantum MEP hydrodynamical model has been devised for charge transport in the parabolic band approximation by introducing quantum correction based on the equilibrium Wigner function [30]. An extension to electron moving in pristine graphene has been obtained in [29]. Here we present a quantum hydrodynamical model which is valid for a general energy band considering a closure of the moment system deduced by the Wigner equation resorting to a quantum version of MEP. Explicit formulas for quantum correction at order \hbar^2 are obtained with the aid of the Moyal calculus for silicon and graphene removing the limitation that the quantum corrections are based on the equilibrium Wigner function as in [9, 29]. As an application, quantum correction to the mobilities are deduced.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Problems in Quantum Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studies of quantum squeezing, the emphasis is typically placed more on specific squeezed states and their evolution rather than on the dynamical operations that could simultaneously squeeze a broader range of quantum states, regardless of their initial configuration. We explore new developments in this area, facilitated by gently acting external fields which might induce squeezing of the canonical observables $q$ and $p$ in charged particles. The extensive research in this field has yielded many valuable insights, raising the question of whether there is still room for significant new contributions to our understanding. Nonetheless, we present some exactly solvable instances of this problem, observed in symmetric evolution intervals. These intervals allow for the explicit determination of the temporal dependence of external fields necessary to generate the required evolution operators. Our findings are linked with a straightforward application of Toeplitz matrices, offering a more accessible description of the problem compared to the frequently employed Ermakov-Milne invariants.</description>

      <title>Unification of the Fundamental Forces in Higher-Order Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Part I of the present series of papers, we adumbrate our idea of Riemannian geometry to higher order in the infinitesimals and derive expressions for the appropriate generalizations of parallel transport and the Riemannian curvature tensor. In Part II, the implications of higher-order geometry for the general theory of relativity beyond Einstein are developed. In the present Part III, we expand on the framework of Part II so as to take up the problem of field-theoretical unification. Employing the form of the Einstein-Hilbert action to higher order as proposed in Part II, we show how in nearly flat space the higher-order terms give rise to a gauge theory of Yang-Mills type. At the 2-jet level, the electroweak force emerges after imposition of gauge fixing. In fact, the proposed form of the Einstein-Hilbert action permits us to say more: we argue that the equivalence principle results in a Proca term that brings about the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the standard model. Two empirical predictions support our reasoning: first, we obtain a theoretical value for the Weinberg angle and second, we find that -- without any adjustable parameters -- the implied value of Coulomb's constant agrees well with experiment. The final section examines the 3-jet level. The same mechanism that produces Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory at the 2-jet level eventuates in a chromodynamical force having $SU(3)$ symmetry at the 3-jet level.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing dynamics of two algebraic solitons in the massive Thirring model. Each algebraic soliton corresponds to a simple embedded eigenvalue in the Kaup--Newell spectral problem and attains the maximal mass among the family of solitary waves traveling with the same speed. By coalescence of speeds of the two algebraic solitons, we find a new solution for an algebraic double-soliton which corresponds to a double embedded eigenvalue. We show that the double-soliton attains the double mass of a single soliton and describes a slow interaction of two identical algebraic solitons.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <title>Random Disks of Constant Curvature: the Lattice Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay the groundwork for a UV-complete formulation of the Euclidean Jackiw-Teitelboim two-dimensional models of quantum gravity when the boundary lengths are finite, emphasizing the discretized approach. The picture that emerges is qualitatively new. For the disk topology, the problem reduces to counting so-called self-overlapping curves, that are closed loops that bound a distorted disk, with an appropriate multiplicity. We build a matrix model that does the correct counting. The theories in negative, zero and positive curvatures have the same UV description but drastically different macroscopic properties. The Schwarzian theory emerges in the limit of very large and negative cosmological constant in the negative curvature model, as an effective theory valid on distance scales much larger than the curvature length scale. In positive curvature, we argue that large geometries are ubiquitous and that the theory exists only for positive cosmological constant. Our discussion is pedagogical and includes a review of several relevant topics.</description>

      <title>The Study of the Canonical forms of Killing tensor in vacuum with {\Lambda}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. Our scope is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein's equations or to determine the hidden symmetries of the already known ones. In this preliminary work we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor. Subsequently, we employ the integrability conditions of each canonical form along with the Einstein field equations (in vacuum with {\Lambda}) and the Bianchi identities in an attempt to create a solvable yet overdetermined system of equations. Finally, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O). The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.</description>

      <title>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be fully understood. We fill this knowledge gap by considering a diffusing particle and presenting a stochastic definition of Brownian motion in the presence of a permeable barrier. This definition relies on reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to when barrier permeability is asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised ``ratchet'' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Magnetohydrodynamics Models as Scaling Limits of Stochastic Induction Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of a stochastic model for the induction equations of the magnetic field in a three dimensional periodic domain. The turbulent velocity field driving the electromotive force on the magnetic field is modeled by a noise white in time. For this model we rigorously take a scaling limit leading to a deterministic model. While in case of isotropic turbulence this produces an additional dissipation in the limit model which influences also the decay rate of the Magnetic field in the stochastic model, the case of turbulence devoloped in a preferential direction allows us to find a dynamo effect.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Set-Theoretic Polygon Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polygon equations generalize the prominent pentagon equation in very much the same way as simplex equations generalize the famous Yang-Baxter equation. In particular, they appeared as ''cocycle equations'' in Street's category theory associated with oriented simplices. Whereas the $(N-1)$-simplex equation can be regarded as a realization of the higher Bruhat order $B(N,N-2)$, the $N$-gon equation is a realization of the higher Tamari order $T(N,N-2)$. The latter and its dual $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, associated with which is the dual $N$-gon equation, have been shown to arise as suborders of $B(N,N-2)$ via a ''three-color decomposition''. There are two different reductions of $T(N,N-2)$ and $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, to ${T(N-1,N-3)}$, respectively $\tilde T(N-1,N-3)$. In this work, we explore the corresponding reductions of (dual) polygon equations, which lead to relations between solutions of neighboring (dual) polygon equations. We also elaborate (dual) polygon equations in this respect explicitly up to the octagon equation.</description>

      <title>A Note on BKP for the Kontsevich Matrix Model with Arbitrary Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit the Kontsevich matrix model with arbitrary potential as a BKP tau-function with respect to polynomial deformations of the potential. The result can be equivalently formulated in terms of Cartan-Pl\"ucker relations of certain averages of Schur $Q$-function. The extension of a Pfaffian integration identity of de Bruijn to singular kernels is instrumental in the derivation of the result.</description>

Abstract: The term Bethe Ansatz stands for a multitude of methods in the theory of integrable models in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory that were designed to study the spectra, the thermodynamic properties and the correlation functions of these models non-perturbatively. This essay attempts to a give a brief overview of some of these methods and their development, mostly based on the example of the Heisenberg model and the corresponding six-vertex model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Anderson localization, strong dynamical localization and the $(\frac 12-)$-H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS) for some multi-dimensional discrete quasi-periodic (QP) Schr\"odinger operators with asymmetric $C^2$-cosine type potentials. We extend both the iteration scheme of \cite{CSZ23a} and the interlacing method of \cite{FV21} to handle asymmetric Rellich functions with collapsed gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Kawasetsu:2018irs}, Kawasetsu proved that the simple W-algebra associated with a minimal nilpotent element $W_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite for $\mathfrak{g}=D_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6$. In this paper, we study ${W}_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ algebra for $\mathfrak{g}=E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6+1$. We determine all irreducible (Ramond twisted) modules, compute their characters and find coset constructions and Hecke operator interpretations. These W-algebras are closely related to intermediate Lie algebras and intermediate vertex subalgebras.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 3D Boltzmann equation with the constant collision kernel. We investigate the well/ill-posedness problem using the methods from nonlinear dispersive PDEs. We construct a family of special solutions, which are neither near equilibrium nor self-similar, to the equation, and prove that the well/ill-posedness threshold in $H^{s}$ Sobolev space is exactly at regularity $s=1$, despite the fact that the equation is scale invariant at $s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for enchancing Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <title>The Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model and Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process on Regular Trees: Infinite-Order Transition and an Intermediate Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the supercritical phase of the vertex-reinforced jump process (VRJP) and the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model on rooted regular trees. The VRJP is a random walk, which is more likely to jump to vertices on which it has previously spent a lot of time. The $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model is a supersymmetric lattice spin model, originally introduced as a toy model for the Anderson transition. On infinite rooted regular trees, the VRJP undergoes a recurrence/transience transition controlled by an inverse temperature parameter $\beta &gt; 0$. Approaching the critical point from the transient regime, $\beta \searrow \beta_{\mathrm{c}}$, we show that the expected total time spent at the starting vertex diverges as $\sim \exp(c/\sqrt{\beta - \beta_{\mathrm{c}}})$. Moreover, on large finite trees we show that the VRJP exhibits an additional intermediate regime for parameter values $\beta_{\mathrm{c}} &lt; \beta &lt; \beta_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{erg}}$. In this regime, despite being transient in infinite volume, the VRJP on finite trees spends an unusually long time at the starting vertex with high probability. We provide analogous results for correlation functions of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model. Our proofs rely on the application of branching random walk methods to a horospherical marginal of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit, and does not involve analytic continuation or algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>Phases and Duality in Fundamental Kazakov-Migdal Model on the Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several approaches to formulate gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin field in $d$ dimensions including the following: (i) in terms of symmetric tensor fields $\phi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, with $k = s, s-1, \dots , 0$, restricted to be double traceless for $k\geq 4$; and (ii) in terms of a quartet of $traceful$ symmetric tensor fields $\psi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, of rank $k=s,s-1,s-2, s-3$. We demonstrate that these formulations in Minkowski space ${\mathbb M}^d$ are equivalent to the gauge-invariant theory for a massive integer-spin field proposed in 1989 by Pashnev. We also make use of the Klishevich-Zinoviev theory in ${\mathbb M}^d$ to derive a generalisation of the Singh-Hagen model for a massive integer-spin field in $d&gt;4 $ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Deformation localisation in stretched liquid crystal elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model within the framework of finite elasticity two inherent instabilities observed in liquid crystal elastomers under uniaxial tension. First is necking which occurs when a material sample suddenly elongates more in a small region where it appears narrower than the rest of the sample. Second is shear striping, which forms when the in-plane director rotates gradually to realign and become parallel with the applied force. These phenomena are due to the liquid crystal molecules rotating freely under mechanical loading. To capture necking, we assume that the uniaxial order parameter increases with tensile stretch, as reported experimentally during polydomain-monodomain transition. To account for shear striping, we maintain the uniaxial order parameter fixed, as suggested by experiments. Our finite element simulations capture well these phenomena. As necking in liquid crystal elastomers has not been satisfactorily modelled before, our theoretical and numerical findings related to this effect can be of wide interest. Shear striping has been well studied, yet our computed examples also show how optimal stripe width increases with the nematic penetration depth measuring the competition between the Frank elasticity of liquid crystals and polymer elasticity. Although known theoretically, this result has not been confirmed numerically by previous nonlinear elastic models.</description>

      <title>Large data global existence for coupled massive-massless wave-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 3D Klein-Gordon-Zakharov (KGZ) and Dirac-Klein-Gordon (DKG) systems, where a common feature is that there exist both massless and massive fields in each system. We establish global existence and asymptotic behavior for both systems with a class of large data. More precisely, in the KGZ system, we allow the massless field to be large, while in the DKG system we allow the massive field to be large.</description>
