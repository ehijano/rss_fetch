      <title>Faint Radio Signals from Very High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in the Strong Astrophysical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may convert into photons in a magnetic field (MF) through the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The properties of the MF significantly influence this conversion probability. Although interstellar and interplanetary magnetic fields are vast, their low intensities result in limited conversion probabilities. Here, we confirm that strong MFs in neutron stars significantly increase this conversion probability. We use single-dish telescopes FAST, TMRT, QTT, and GBT, as well as the radio interferometers SKA1-MID and SKA2-MID, to estimate the detection potential of very high-frequency (VHF) GWs. We infer two types of signals in the $10^{6}-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}$ radio waveband: transient and persistent signals. We propose three criteria for distinguishing signals from other astrophysical signals while identifying different GW sources. We derive the expected intrinsic spectral line shapes for gravitons by considering their mass and spin in quantum field theory (QFT). These are smooth, continuous lines that don't have any absorption or emission features. FAST has the highest sensitivity in single-dish telescopes for detecting VHF GWs, it provides a bound on the characteristic strain at $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$ near $h_c=10^{-24}$ within $\left[1\mathrm{~GHz}, 3\mathrm{~GHz}\right]$ with 6 hours of observation time. This exceeds the threshold for detecting VHF GWs produced by primordial black holes (PBHs) with over $5\sigma$ confidence and approaches the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bound. Moreover, SKA2-MID has greater detection potential. Detection of such GWs would enhance our understanding of cosmological models, refine the PBH parameter spaces, and serve as a test for QFT.</description>

      <title>TiDES -- Young Supernova Selection Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-time spectroscopy of supernovae (SNe), acquired within days of explosion, yields crucial insights into their outermost ejecta layers, facilitating the study of their environments, progenitor systems, and explosion mechanisms. Recent efforts in early discovery and follow-up of SNe have shown the potential insights that can be gained from early-time spectra. The Time-Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES), conducted with the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST), will provide spectroscopic follow-up of transients discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Current simulations indicate that early-time spectroscopic studies conducted with TiDES data will be limited by the current SN selection criteria. To enhance TiDES's capability for early-time SN spectroscopic studies, we propose an additional set of selection criteria focusing on early-time (young) SNe (YSNe). Utilising the Zwicky Transient Facility live transient alerts, we developed criteria to select YSNe while minimising the sample's contamination rate to 28 percent. The developed criteria were applied to LSST simulations, yielding a sample of 1167 Deep Drilling Field survey SNe and 67388 Wide Fast Deep survey SNe for follow-up with 4MOST. We demonstrate that our criteria enables the selection of SNe at early-times, enhancing TiDES's future early-time spectroscopic SN studies. Finally, we investigated 4MOST-like observing strategies to increase the sample of spectroscopically observed YSNe. We propose that a 4MOST-like observing strategy that follows LSST with a delay of 3 days is optimal for the TiDES SN survey, while a 1 day delay is most optimal for enhancing the early-time science in conjunction with our YSN selection criteria.</description>

      <title>A Search for Low-Mass Neutron Stars in the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most observed neutron stars have masses around 1.4 $M_\odot$, consistent with current formation mechanisms. To date, no sub-solar mass neutron star has been observed. Observing a low-mass neutron star would be a significant milestone, providing crucial constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unveiling a new population of neutron stars, and advancing the study of their formation processes and underlying mechanisms. We present the first targeted search for tidally deformed sub-solar mass binary neutron stars (BNS), with primary masses ranging from 0.1 to 2 $M_\odot$ and secondary masses from 0.1 to 1 $M_\odot$, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. We account for the tidal deformabilities of up to $O(10^4)$ of these systems, as low-mass neutron stars are more easily distorted by their companions' gravitational forces. Previous searches that neglect tidal deformability lose sensitivity to low-mass sources, potentially missing more than $\sim30\%$ of detectable signals from a system with a chirp mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ binaries. No statistically significant detections were made. In the absence of a detection, we place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the local merger rate for sub-solar mass BNS systems, constraining it to be $&lt; 6.4\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $M_\odot$ and $&lt; 2.2\times 10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for 0.7 $M_\odot$. With future upgrades to detector sensitivity, development of next-generation detectors, and ongoing improvements in search pipelines, constraints on the minimum mass of neutron stars will improve, providing the potential to constrain the nuclear equation of state, reveal new insights into neutron star formation channels, and potentially identify new classes of stars.</description>

      <title>Sun-related variability in the light curves of compact radio sources. A new view on Extreme Scattering Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An in-depth analysis of variability has been carried out on the 2 GHz and 8 GHz light curves from the impressive database of the US Navy's extragalactic source monitoring program at the Green Bank Interferometer (GBI), complemented by UMRAO light curves for selected sources. The data have been inspected in a search for one-year periodic patterns. Variations on timescales below one year have been isolated through a de-trending algorithm and analysed, looking for correlations with the Sun's position relative to the sources. Objects at ecliptic latitude below ~20deg show one-year periodic drops in flux densities, centred close to the time of minimum solar elongation; both interplanetary scintillation and instrumental effects may contribute to these events. However, in some cases the drops extend to much larger angular distances, affecting sources at high ecliptic latitudes, and causing variability on timescales of months. Three different kinds of such events have been identified in the data; their exact nature is not yet known. These events significantly alter the sources' variability characteristics estimated at GHz frequencies. In particular, we found that many extreme scattering events previously identified in the GBI monitoring program are the consequence of Sun-related effects; others occur simultaneously in several objects, which excludes interstellar scattering as their possible cause. These discoveries have a severe impact on our understanding of extreme scattering events. Furthermore, Sun-related variability can significantly alter results of variability studies, which are very powerful tools for the investigation of active galactic nuclei. Without a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that cause these variations, the estimation of some essential information about the emitting regions, such as their size and all the derived quantities, might be seriously compromised.</description>

      <title>Detectability prospects for long-lived gamma-ray emission from r-process events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray emission from radioactive decay in r-process-enriched kilonova and supernova remnants offers a direct method for probing heavy element synthesis in the Milky Way. We assess the feasibility of such detections through an all-sky survey using mock instruments similar to the COmpton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) and targeted observations with sensitive, low field-of-view instruments similar to the High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P). By modeling the spatial distribution of potential remnants and generating synthetic time-evolving gamma-ray spectra, we compare predicted fluxes to the sensitivity limits of each instrument. Our findings suggest that the likelihood of detecting kilonova remnants with COSI-like instruments over a 24-month observing cycle is extremely low (~1%), highlighting the need for instruments with at least ten times greater sensitivity to make such detections more probable. The superior sensitivity of a HEX-P-like instrument offers higher chances of detection, provided suitable targets are identified. We propose methods for optimizing target selection and outline the observational advancements needed to improve detectability prospects. Both detections and non-detections carry important implications for our understanding of galactic r-process nucleosynthesis, influencing future observational strategies.</description>

      <title>Pulse Profile Variability of PSR J1022+1001 in NANOGrav Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile stability is a central assumption of standard pulsar timing methods. Thus, it is important for pulsar timing array experiments such as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) to account for any pulse profile variability present in their data sets. We show that in the NANOGrav 15-yr data set, the integrated pulse profile of PSR J1022+1001 as seen by the Arecibo radio telescope at 430, 1380, and 2030 MHz varies considerably in its shape from observation to observation. We investigate the possibility that this is due to the "ideal feed assumption" (IFA), on which NANOGrav's routine polarization calibration procedure relies. PSR J1022+1001 is $\sim 90\%$ polarized in one pulse profile component, and also has significant levels of circular polarization. Time-dependent deviations in the feed's polarimetric response (PR) could cause mixing between the intensity I and the other Stokes parameters, leading to the observed variability. We calibrate the PR using a mixture of Measurement Equation Modeling and Measurement Equation Template Matching techniques. The resulting profiles are no less variable than those calibrated using the IFA method, nor do they provide an improvement in the timing quality of this pulsar. We observe the pulse shape in 25-MHz bandwidths to vary consistently across the band, which cannot be explained by interstellar scintillation in combination with profile evolution with frequency. Instead, we favor phenomena intrinsic to the pulsar as the cause.</description>

      <title>The birth mass function of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The birth mass function of neutron stars encodes rich information about supernova explosions, double star evolution, and properties of matter under extreme conditions. To date, it has remained poorly constrained by observations, however. Applying probabilistic corrections to account for mass accreted by recycled pulsars in binary systems to mass measurements of 90 neutron stars, we find that the birth masses of neutron stars can be described by a unimodal distribution that smoothly turns on at $\mathbf{\unit[1.1]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$, peaks at $\mathbf{\approx \unit[1.27]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$, before declining as a steep power law. Such a ``turn-on" power-law distribution is strongly favoured against the widely-adopted empirical double-Gaussian model at the $\mathbf{3\sigma}$ level. The power-law shape may be inherited from the initial mass function of massive stars, but the relative dearth of massive neutron stars implies that single stars with initial masses greater than $\mathbf{\approx \unit[18]{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}}$ do not form neutron stars, in agreement with the absence of massive red supergiant progenitors to supernovae.</description>

      <title>Classification and physical characteristics analysis of Fermi-GBM Gamma-ray bursts based on Deep-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of Gamma-Ray Bursts has long been an unresolved problem. Early long and short burst classification based on duration is not convincing due to the significant overlap in duration plot, which leads to different views on the classification results. We propose a new classification method based on Convolutional Neural Networks and adopt a sample including 3774 GRBs observed by Fermi-GBM to address the $T_\text{90}$ overlap problem. By using count maps that incorporate both temporal and spectral features as inputs, we successfully classify 593 overlapping events into two distinct categories, thereby refuting the existence of an intermediate GRB class. Additionally, we apply the optimal model to extract features from the count maps and visualized the extracted GRB features using the t-SNE algorithm, discovering two distinct clusters corresponding to S-type and L-type GRBs. To further investigate the physical properties of these two types of bursts, we conduct a time-integrated spectral analysis and discovered significant differences in their spectral characteristics. The analysis also show that most GRBs associated with kilonovae belong to the S-type, while those associated with supernovae are predominantly L-type, with few exceptions. Additionally, the duration characteristics of short bursts with extended emission suggest that they may manifest as either L-type or S-type GRBs. Compared to traditional classification methods (Amati and EHD methods), the new approach demonstrates significant advantages in classification accuracy and robustness without relying on redshift observations. The deep learning classification strategy proposed in this paper provides a more reliable tool for future GRB research.</description>

      <title>Superfluid fraction in the polycrystalline crust of a neutron star: role of BCS pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking of translational symmetry in the inner crust of a neutron star leads to the depletion of the neutron superfluid reservoir similarly to cold atomic condensates in optical lattices and in supersolids. The suppression of the superfluid fraction is studied in the BCS theory for superfluid velocities much smaller than Landau's critical velocity treating the crust as a body-centered cubic polycrystal. To this end, fully three-dimensional band structure calculations have been carried out. Although the formation of Cooper pairs is essential for the occurrence of superfluidity, the superfluid fraction is found to be insensitive to the pairing gap. In the intermediate region of the inner crust at the average baryon number density 0.03~fm$^{-3}$, only 8\% of the free neutrons are found to participate to the superflow. This very low superfluid fraction challenges the classical interpretation of pulsar frequency glitches.</description>

      <title>A new basic air shower observable sensitive to the cosmic-ray elemental mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a Monte Carlo simulation study of vertical extensive air showers (EAS) at the KASCADE location we introduce a new simple observable $\eta_{\rho{(45;310)}}$ (in short $\eta_{\rho}$) - the ratio between two lateral electron densities of an EAS measured at two well-defined radial distances indicated by the characteristic radial feature of the local age parameter (LAP). Our analyses of simulated data generated by the Group I nuclei with cosmic-ray elemental masses, $A_{\text{actual}}=1,4,12,16,24,32,40,56$, observed a double correlation of $\eta_{\rho}$ with, (i) the lateral shower age $s_{\text{av}}$, and (ii) $A_{\text{actual}}$ of the EAS initiating primary particle. Applying the first correlation to a new set of simulated showers initiated by the Group II nuclei with $A_{\text{actual}}=7,14,20,28,40,52$, the average difference between the lateral shower age $s_{\text{av}}$ obtained directly from the conventional LAP approach and the estimated one $s_{\text{est}}$ is found to be close to $0$. The second correlation involving $\eta_{\rho}$ with $A_{\text{actual}}$ applied to the set of such showers estimates the average atomic mass $&lt;\ln{A_{\text{est}}}&gt;$ of their shower initiating primaries, utilizing the $\eta_{\rho}$s. Results of the work revealed that the method of estimating the lateral shower age is almost high-energy interaction model-independent. A certain level of model dependence is albeit found in the case of $&lt;\ln{A_{\text{est}}}&gt;$ estimation.</description>

      <title>Black hole pulsars and monster shocks as outcomes of black hole-neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of a black hole (BH) and a neutron star (NS) in most cases is expected to leave no material around the remnant BH; therefore, such events are often considered as sources of gravitational waves without electromagnetic counterparts. However, a bright counterpart can emerge if the NS is strongly magnetized, as its external magnetosphere can experience radiative shocks and magnetic reconnection during/after the merger. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the dynamical spacetime of a merging BH-NS binary to investigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We find that the magnetosphere develops compressive waves that steepen into shocks. After swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a magnetosphere that quickly evolves into a split monopole configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay (balding), enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down of the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into rotation, forming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped wind if the swallowed magnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin axis. We predict two types of transients from this scenario: (1) a fast radio burst emitted by the shocks as they expand to large radii and (2) an X/gamma-ray burst emitted by the $e^\pm$ outflow heated by magnetic dissipation.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of type I (thermonuclear) bursts in the new transient SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report analysis of $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT observations of the newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. During the outburst, detected in 2024 February by $\textit{eROSITA}$, the broadband persistent spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed Comptonization model. We detected 60 type I X-ray bursts in the $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT medium energy (ME) data, and 37 were also detected with the low-energy (LE) telescope. By superimposing the $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT/LE/ME/HE light curves of 37 bursts with similar profiles and intensities, we measured a deficit of X-rays in the 40$-$70 keV energy band. By analyzing the time-resolved X-ray burst spectra, we determine the mean ratio of persistent to burst flux of $\alpha=71\pm7$. We estimate the average hydrogen mass fraction in the fuel at ignition, as $\bar{X} = 0.342 \pm 0.033$, and constrain the burst fuel composition as $X_0\lesssim0.4$. We found that 14 out of 60 X-ray bursts exhibited photospheric expansion, and thus we estimated the distance to the source as $10.03\pm 0.71$ kpc. Combined with $\textit{IXPE}$ observations, the burst recurrence time were increasing from 1.55 to 8 hr as the local mass accretion rate decreasing, which can be described as $\Delta T_{\rm rec}\sim \dot{m}^{-0.91\pm0.02}$.</description>

      <title>Quenching and recovery of persistent X-ray emission during a superburst in 4U 1820$-$30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the superburst from 4U 1820--30 in 2021 observed by Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). During the tail of the superburst, we found that the NICER light curve unexpectedly increased from 1080 to 2204 ${\rm cts~s^{-1}}$ over 6.89 hr. From the time-resolved superburst spectra, we estimated the burst decay time of $\sim2.7$ hr, the ignition column depth of $\sim0.3\times 10^{12}~{\rm g ~cm^{-2}}$, the energy release per unit mass of $\sim1.7\times 10^{17}~{\rm erg~g^{-1}}$, the fluence of $\sim4.5\times 10^{-4}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}}$, and the total energy release of $\sim3.8\times10^{42}$ erg. Notably, we found a gradual increase in the Componization flux from $8.9\times 10^{-10}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ to the pre-burst level during the superburst. This increase can be interpreted as a consequence of superburst radiation depleting the inner accretion disk, leading to a near-complete quenching of the persistent emission. As the burst radiation decayed, the inner accretion disk gradually returned to its pre-burst state, as evidenced by the best-fit spectral parameters. Additionally, we observed a prominent absorption line that exhibited a gravitational redshift, shifting from 4.16 to 3.60 keV during the recovery phase of persistent emission. This absorption feature likely originates from the inner accretion disk rather than from burst emission on the neutron star (NS) surface. The observed changes in the absorption line energy suggest that the inner disk approached the NS to a distance as close as $\sim16$ km.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Fermi-LAT Blazar Light Curves: A Systematic Search for Periodicity and Trends in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A majority of blazars exhibit variable emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, observed over various time scales. In particular, discernible periodic patterns are detected in the {\gamma}-ray light curves of a few blazars, such as PG 1553+113, S5 1044+71, and PKS 0426-380. The presence of trends, flares, and noise complicates the detection of periodicity, requiring careful analysis to determine whether these patterns are related to emission mechanisms within the source or occur by chance. We employ Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for the first time on data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to systematically search for periodicity in the time domain, using 28-day binned light curves. Our aim is to isolate any potential periodic nature of the emission from trends and noise, thereby reducing uncertainties in revealing periodicity. Additionally, we aim to characterize long-term trends and develop a forecasting algorithm based on SSA, enabling accurate predictions of future emission behavior. We apply SSA to analyze 494 sources detected by Fermi-LAT, focusing on identifying and isolating periodic components from trends and noise in their {\gamma}-ray light curves. We calculate the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram for the periodic components extracted by SSA to determine the most significant periods. The local and global significance of these periods is then assessed to validate their authenticity. Our analysis identifies 46 blazars as potential candidates for quasi-periodic {\gamma}-ray emissions, each with a local significance level &gt;= 2{\sigma}. Notably, 33 of these candidates exhibit a local significance of &gt;= 4{\sigma} (corresponding to a global significance of &gt;= 2.2{\sigma}). Our findings introduce 25 new {\gamma}-ray candidates, effectively doubling the number of potentially periodic sources.</description>

      <title>Waveform Reconstruction of Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Waves with Improved Multisynchrosqueezing Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) have been proposed as a means to probe the internal physical properties of supernovae. However, due to their complex time-frequency structure, effectively searching for and extracting GW signals from CCSNe remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we apply the improved multisynchrosqueezing transform (IMSST) method to reconstruct simulated GW data based on the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) detectors. These data are generated by the magnetorotational and neutrino-driven mechanisms, and we use the match score as the criterion for evaluating the quality of the reconstruction. To assess whether the reconstructed waveforms correspond to true GW signals, we calculate the false alarm probability of reconstruction (FAPR). For GW sources located at 10 kpc and datasets where the waveform amplitudes are normalized to $5 \times 10^{-21}$ observed by aLIGO, FAPR are $2.1 \times 10^{-2}$ and $6.2 \times 10^{-3}$, respectively. For GW sources at 100 kpc and with waveform amplitudes normalized to $5 \times 10^{-21}$ observed by ET, FAPR are $1.3 \times 10^{-1}$ and $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$, respectively. When the gravitational wave strain reaches $7 \times 10^{-21}$ and the match score threshold is set to 0.75, the IMSST method achieves maximum reconstruction distances of approximately 37 kpc and 317 kpc for aLIGO and ET, respectively. Finally, we compared the performance of IMSST and STFT in waveform reconstruction based on the ET. The results show that the maximum reconstructable distance using STFT is 186 kpc.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Electron Acceleration and the 'Ankle' Spectral Feature in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons are accelerated to high, non-thermal energies during explosive energy-release events in space, such as magnetic reconnection. However, the properties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly associated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study utilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and spectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV) electrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This event provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized by X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field directly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation period. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were clearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed away from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly from the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons deviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an "ankle" feature similar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of "ankle" electrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the separatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations. Further analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated from the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during transport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at the X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Model-independent constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation with update observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching the possible Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) from astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is essential for finding evidences of new theories of quantum gravity. However, the effect of the underlying cosmological model is still understudied in the previous analysis. We take a novel approach using artificial neural networks to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe, thereby eliminating the influence of potential cosmological models to constrain LIV. 74 time delays from GRBs are considered to obtain stringent results on LIV, including 37 time delays measurements from GRB 160625B across various energy bands at redshift $z = 1.41$, and 37 additional GRBs with time delays spanning redshifts $0.117\leq z \leq1.99$. Our analysis yields stringent constraints on both linear and quadratic LIV, with $E_{QG,1} \geq 2.63 \times 10^{15}$ $GeV$ and $ E_{QG,2} \geq 1.19 \times 10^{10}$ $GeV$ that are four and nine orders of magnitude beneath the Planck energy scale, and shows the positive intrinsic time delay in GRBs. Our results demonstrate that such combination would significantly improve the precision and robustness of final results. Taking this into account may be an important contribution in the case of possible LIV detection in the future.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of internal shocks in spherical geometry: hydrodynamics and prompt emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the models used to explain the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), internal shocks is a leading one. Its most basic ingredient is a collision between two cold shells of different Lorentz factors in an ultra-relativistic outflow, which forms a pair of shock fronts that accelerate electrons in their wake. The optically-thin synchrotron emission from the high-energy electrons at both shock fronts explains key features of the prompt GRB emission and their diversity without fine-tuning of the physical conditions. We investigate the internal shocks model as mechanism for prompt emission based on a full hydrodynamical analytic derivation in planar geometry by Rahaman et al. (2024a,b), extending this approach to spherical geometry using hydrodynamic simulations. We used the moving mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code GAMMA to study the collision of two ultra-relativistic cold shells of equal kinetic energy (and power). Using the built-in shock detection, we calculate the corresponding synchrotron emission by the relativistic electrons accelerated into a power-law energy distribution behind the shock, in the fast cooling regime. During the first dynamical time after the collision, the spherical effects cause the shock strength to decrease with radius. The observed peak frequency decreases faster than expected by other models in the rising part of the pulse, and the peak flux saturates even for moderately short pulses. This is likely caused by the very sharp edges of the shells in our model, while smoother edges will probably mitigate this effect. Our model traces the evolution of the peak frequency back to the source activity time scales.</description>

      <title>Revision of two-temperature magnetically arrested flows onto a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit radiative properties of 3-D GRMHD two-temperature magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models in which electrons are heated up by magnetic turbulent cascade. We focus on studying the models emission which characteristics include variability in both total intensity and linear/circular polarizations as well as rotation measures at energies around synchrotron emission peak in millimeter waves. We find that radiative properties of MAD models with turbulent electron heating are well converged with respect to the numerical grid resolution, which has not been demonstrated before. We compare radiation from the two-temperature simulations with turbulent heating to single-temperature models with electron temperatures calculated based on commonly used $R(\beta)$ prescription. We find that the two-temperature models do not significantly overperform the $R(\beta)$ models and in practice may be indistinguishable from the $R(\beta)$ models. Accounting for physical effects such as radiative cooling and non-thermal electron distribution function makes a weak impact on properties of millimeter emission. Models are scaled to Sgr~A* - an accreting black hole in the center of our galaxy, and compared to the most complete observational datasets. We point out consistencies and inconsistencies between the MAD models and observations of this source and discuss future prospects for GRMHD simulations.</description>

      <title>"Bursts, Beats, and Beyond": Uncovering the landscape from accretion to ignition of 4U 1728--34 using \textit{AstroSat}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study on persistent and thermonuclear burst emission of 4U 1728--34, commonly known as `Slow Burster' is performed using seven archival observations of \textit{AstroSat} spanning from 2016--2019. The burst-free persistent spectra can be well fitted with a blackbody \texttt{bbody} and a powerlaw \texttt{powerlaw} components, with a powerlaw photon index ($\Gamma$) was found to be $\sim$2 indicating the source was in ``high/soft" bananna state or intermediate state. The time averaged power density spectrum reveals the presence of twin kilohertz Quasi Periodic Oscillations (kHz QPOs) with centroid frequencies $619\pm10$~Hz and $965\pm6$~Hz with a maximum fractional root mean squared amplitude of $6.24\pm1.31$~\% at $\sim$16~keV. From the upper kHz QPO, we infer the magnetospheric disk radius to be $\sim$17~km, corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 0.35--1.27$~\times~10^7$~G. The burst spectral evolution indicates Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE) in five bursts, yielding a touchdown radius of 3.1--5.47~km. These bursts reached near-Eddington luminosities, through which the distance of the source was calculated to be 5.18--5.21~kpc. Two of the bursts show coherent oscillations at 362.81--363.93~Hz. The presence of twin kHz QPOs and coherent Burst Oscillations allows us to provide two different estimates for the spin frequency of the Neutron Star in the system, for the first time using \textit{AstroSat}.</description>

      <title>GRB241107A: a Giant Flare from a close-by extragalactic Magnetar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06668v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results on the short gamma-ray burst GRB 241107A, obtained with the IBIS instrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The burst had a duration of about 0.2 s, a fluence of $8 \times 10^{-7}$ erg cm-2 in the 20 keV-10 MeV range and a hard spectrum, characterized by a peak energy of 680 keV. The position of GRB 241107A has been precisely determined because it fell inside the imaging field of view of the IBIS coded mask instrument. The presence of the nearby galaxy PGC 86046 in the 3 arcmin radius error region, suggests that GRB 241107A might be a giant flare from a magnetar rather than a canonical short GRB. For the 4.1 Mpc distance of PGC 86046, the isotropic energy of $1.6 \times 10^{45}$ erg is in agreement with this hypothesis, that is also supported by the time resolved spectral properties similar to those of the few other extragalactic magnetars giant flares detected so far.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Spin Constraints from Polarimetry in an Equatorial Disk Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope has released polarized images of the supermassive black holes Messier 87* (M87*) and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) accretion disks. As more images are produced, our understanding of the average polarized emission from near the event horizon improves. In this letter, we use a semi-analytic model for optically thin, equatorial emission near a Kerr black hole to study how spin constraints follow from measurements of the average polarization spiral pitch angle. We focus on the case of M87* and explore how the direct, weakly lensed image spiral is coupled to the strongly lensed indirect image spiral, and how a precise measurement of both provides a powerful spin tracer. We find a generic result that spin twists the direct and indirect image polarization in opposite directions. Using a grid search over model parameters, we find a strong dependence of the resulting spin constraint on plasma properties near the horizon. Grid constraints suggest that, under reasonable assumptions for the accretion disk, a measurement of the direct and indirect image spiral pitch angles to $\pm 5^\circ$ yields a dimensionless spin amplitude measurement with uncertainty $\sigma_{|a_*|}\sim0.25$ for radially infalling models, but otherwise provides only weak constraints; an error of $1^\circ$ can reach $\sigma_{|a_*|}\sim0.15$. We also find that a well-constrained rotation measure greatly improves spin measurements. Assuming that equatorial velocity and magnetic field are oppositely oriented, we find that the observed M87* polarization pattern favors models with strong radial velocity components, which are close to optimal for future spin measurements.</description>

      <title>An unexplored regime of shock breakout with a distinct spectral signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first light that escapes from a supernova explosion is the shock breakout emission, which produces a bright flash of UV or X-ray radiation. Standard theory predicts that the shock breakout spectrum will be a blackbody if the gas and radiation are in thermal equilibrium, or a Comptonized free-free spectrum if not. Using recent results for the post-breakout evolution which suggest that lower-temperature ejecta are probed earlier than previously thought, we show that another scenario is possible in which the gas and radiation are initially out of equilibrium, but the time when thermalized ejecta are revealed is short compared to the light-crossing time of the system. In this case, the observed spectrum differs significantly from the standard expectation, as the non-negligible light travel time acts to smear the spectrum into a complex multi-temperature blend of blackbody and free-free components. For typical parameters, a bright multi-wavelength transient is produced, with the free-free emission being spread over a wide frequency range from optical to hard X-rays, and the blackbody component peaking in soft X-rays. We explore the necessary conditions to obtain this type of unusual spectrum, finding that it may be relevant for bare blue supergiant progenitors, or for shocks with a velocity of $v_{\rm bo} \sim 0.1c$ breaking out from an extended medium of radius $R_{\rm env}$ with a sufficiently high density $\rho_{\rm bo} \gtrsim 4\times 10^{-12}\text{ g cm}^{-3} (R_{\rm env}/10^{14} \text{cm})^{-15/16}$. An application to low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts is considered in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Demystifying shock breakout spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of the first supernova light (i.e., the shock breakout and early cooling emission) is an important diagnostic for the state of the progenitor star just before explosion. We consider a streamlined model describing the emergent shock breakout spectrum, which enables a straightforward classification of the possible observed spectra during the early planar phase. The overall spectral evolution is determined by a competition between three important time-scales: the diffusion time $t_{\rm{bo}}$ of the shell producing the breakout emission, the light-crossing time of this shell $t_{\rm{lc}}$, and the time $t_{\rm{eq}}$ at which the observer starts to see layers of the ejecta where the gas and radiation are in thermal equilibrium. There are five allowed orderings of these time-scales, resulting in five possible scenarios with distinct spectral behaviours. Within each scenario, the spectrum at a given time is one of five possible types, which are approximately described by broken power-laws; we provide the spectral and temporal indices of each power-law segment, and the time evolution of the break frequencies. If high-cadence multi-wavelength observations can determine the relevant breakout scenario in future events, strong constraints can be placed on the physical conditions at the site of shock breakout.</description>

      <title>Revisiting GRB 060218: new insights into low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts from a revised shock breakout model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite two decades since the discovery of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, their origin remains poorly understood. In events such as GRB 060218, shock breakout from a progenitor with an extended ($10^{13}$ - $10^{14}$ cm), low-mass (0.01 - 0.1 M$_\odot$) envelope provides one possible interpretation for the smooth prompt X-ray emission lasting $\sim 1000$ s and the early optical peak at $\sim 0.5$ d. However, current shock breakout models have difficulties explaining the unexpectedly strong optical emission at $\sim 100$ s, the simultaneous presence of blackbody and power-law components in the X-ray spectrum, and the rapid evolution of the peak energy. We suggest that these peculiar features can be explained by a recently realized shock breakout scenario, in which the gas and the radiation are initially out of thermal equilibrium, but they achieve equilibrium on a time-scale faster than the light-crossing time of the envelope. In this non-standard case, due to the effects of light travel time, the observed X-ray spectrum is a multi-temperature blend of blackbody and free-free components. The free-free emission is spectrally broad, peaking in hard X-rays while also enhancing the early optical signal. As the system thermalizes, the free-free component quickly evolves toward lower energies, reproducing the observed rapid peak energy decay. To match observations, we find that more than $10^{50}$ erg must be deposited in the envelope, which may be accomplished by a choked jet. These results strengthen the case for a shock breakout origin of $ll$GRBs, and provide further evidence connecting $ll$GRBs to peculiar progenitors with extended low-mass envelopes.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed quarkyonic neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate $f-$mode oscillations ($\ell$ = 2) in quarkyonic neutron stars with dark matter, employing the Cowling approximation within the framework of linearized general relativity. The relativistic mean-field approach is used to compute various macroscopic properties of neutron stars. The analysis focuses on three key free parameters in the model: transition density, QCD confinement scale, and dark matter (DM) Fermi momentum, all of which significantly affect the properties of $f-$mode oscillations. The inclusion of dark matter in quarkyonic equations of state leads to notable variations in $f-$mode frequencies. Despite these changes, several universal relations among the oscillation properties are found to hold, demonstrating their robustness in the presence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous decametre detection of ultra steep spectrum radio emission in Abell 655</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some galaxy clusters contain non-thermal synchrotron emitting plasma permeating the intracluster medium (ICM). The spectral properties of this radio emission are not well characterized at decameter wavelengths ({\nu} &lt; 30 MHz), primarily due to the severe corrupting effects of the ionosphere. Using a recently developed calibration strategy, we present LOFAR images below 30 MHz of the low mass galaxy cluster Abell 655, which was serendipitously detected in an observation of the bright calibrator 3C 196. We combine this observation with LOFAR data at 144 MHz, and new Band 4 Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations centered at 650 MHz. In the 15-30 MHz LOFAR image, diffuse emission is seen with a physical extent of about 700 kpc. We argue that the diffuse emission detected in this galaxy cluster likely has multiple origins. At higher frequencies (650 MHz), the diffuse emission resembles a radio halo, while at lower frequencies the emission seems to consist of several components and bar-like structures. It suggests that most low-frequency emission in this cluster comes from re-energized fossil plasma from old AGN outbursts, coexisting with the radio halo component. By counting the number of cluster radio detections in the decameter band, we estimate that around a quarter of the Planck clusters host re-energised fossil plasma that is detectable in the decameter band with LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of magnetic white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic white dwarfs has been a long standing puzzle. Proposed origin mechanisms have included: fossil fields frozen in from the progenitor convective core; a dynamo in the progenitor envelope; crystallization dynamos in sufficiently cool white dwarfs; and accretion disk dynamos from white dwarf-white dwarf mergers or tidally shredded low mass stellar or planetary companions. Here we show how observational constraints on white dwarf magnetic field strengths, ages, and masses can be used to narrow down the viability of proposed origin mechanisms. Using the best available data, we find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic white dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the field is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the white dwarfs forms. Crystallization dynamos, if operative, occur too late to explain the bulk of magnetic white dwarfs. And with progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by the theoretical challenge of depositing field from envelope to white dwarf core, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most resilient to present constraints. The methods herein also reveal observational data gaps, and motivate future acquisition of more complete data.</description>

      <title>The Temperature versus Orbital Period relation of AM CVns: Insights from their Donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 22 known AM~CVns with orbital periods ($P_{orb}$) larger than 35~min using multiwavelength public photometric data to estimate the effective temperature of the accreting white dwarf. We find an infrared (IR) excess in all systems when compared to a single blackbody, both when the disk should be extended and when it should be truncated by the accretor's magnetic field. This suggests a dominant contribution from the donor to the IR flux. When fitting two blackbodies, the temperature of the hot component decreases with $P_{orb}$, as expected by evolutionary models. Temperatures for systems with $35&lt;P_{orb}&lt;45~\text{min}$ are consistent with models. Systems with $P_{orb}\gtrsim45~\text{min}$ have higher temperatures than expected. The second blackbody temperature does not correlate with $P_{orb}$.</description>

      <title>Implications of latest NICER data for the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level); central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Behaviour and Variability of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxies with Australia Telescope Compact Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency radio data for a sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. We first focus on the sub-class of gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, studying the long-term radio variability of five sources and comparing it to their gamma-ray state. We then extend the observations of the southern narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy sample of Chen et al. by observing several candidate narrow-line Seyfert 1 sources for the first time, and re-observing several other gamma-ray quiet sources to obtain a first indication of their radio variability. We find that the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies are highly variable radio emitters and that there are instances of contemporaneous flaring activity between the radio and gamma-ray band (PKS 0440$-$00, PMN J0948+0022 and PKS 1244$-$255). However, there are also cases of significant radio outbursts without gamma-ray counterparts (PMN J0948+0022 and PKS 2004$-$447). The five gamma-ray NLS1s favour flat or inverted radio spectra, although the spectral indices vary significantly over time. For the gamma-ray quiet sample, the difference between the previous observations at 5.5 GHz and new ATCA observations indicates that over half of the 14 sources exhibit apparent variability. In contrast to gamma-ray loud sources, gamma-ray quiet objects tend to have steep spectra especially in the lower radio band (887.5$-$1367.5 MHz), with a number of the variable sources having flatter spectra at higher radio frequencies.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Fast time optical variability in Supergiant X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to investigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to supergiant X-ray binaries and to compare the general patterns of such variability with the Galactic population of other early-type stars. We analyzed a sample of 14 high-mass X-ray binaries with supergiant companions observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and 4 Be/X-ray binaries with persistent X-ray emission for comparison. All sources exhibit fast time aperiodic light variations. The shape of the periodogram is well described by a red noise component at intermediate frequencies ($\sim 1-10$ d$^{-1}$). At lower frequencies the noise level flattens while at higher frequencies the periodogram is dominated by white noise. We find that the patterns of variability of the massive companions in supergiant X-ray binaries agree with that of single early-type evolved stars in terms of the general shape of the periodograms. However, they exhibit higher amplitude at low frequencies and lower characteristic frequencies than Be/X-ray binaries. Unlike Be/X-ray binaries, supergiant X-ray binaries exhibit a total lack of coherent signals at high frequencies. Most sources have been analyzed over multiple TESS sectors, spanning a duration of 4 years. We do not find any significant variation over time in the low-frequency variability characteristics. This study reveals that stochastic low-frequency variability is a very common, if not ubiquitous, feature intrinsic to supergiant optical companions in X-ray binaries.</description>

Abstract: Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are enigmatic transient events distinguished by a rapid rise in luminosity, a plateau in luminosity, and spectra which become redder with time. The best-observed system before, during, and after the outburst is V1309 Sco. We model a candidate V1309 Sco progenitor binary configuration (1.52+0.16Msun) using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code StarSmasher with a modified energy equation that implements flux-limited emission-diffusion radiative transport in a Lagrangian case. We developed an imaging technique allowing us to capture the flux an observer would measure. In this novel method, the outgoing radiative flux of each SPH particle in the observer's direction is attenuated by other particles along the path to the observer. We investigated how the light curve is affected in various models: with and without dust formation; constant, Planck, or Rosseland mean opacities; different donor star sizes; different companion star masses and types; radiative heating included in our modified energy equation; and different SPH simulation resolutions. The resulting evolution in bolometric luminosity and spectrum peak temperature is in good agreement with V1309 Sco observations. Our simulations rule out V1309 Sco models that do not assume dust formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the universe is well-approximated by the Friedmann equations, parameterised by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: how different would the universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigour, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically-closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant -- in a purely geometric sense -- two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration-space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze observations of the Type Ib supernova (SN) 2019odp (a.k.a ZTF19abqwtfu) covering epochs within days of the explosion to the nebular phase at 360 d post-explosion. We discuss them in the context of recombination cooling emission for the early excess emission and consider progenitor models based on the nebular phase spectra. Our observations include photometric observations mainly in the optical and low to medium-resolution spectroscopic observations covering the complete observable time-range. We expand on existing methods to derive oxygen mass estimates from nebular phase spectroscopy. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the presence of He in the SN ejecta and we thus (re)classify it as a Type Ib supernova. From the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve we estimate a high ejecta mass $M_\text{ej} \sim 4 - 7~M_\odot$. The high ejecta mass, large nebular [O I]/[Ca II] line flux ratio ($1.2 - 1.9$) and an oxygen mass above $\gtrapprox 0.5\, M_\odot$ point towards a progenitor with pre-explosion mass higher than $18\,M_\odot$. The compact nature of the progenitor ($\lesssim 10\,R_\odot$) suggests a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as progenitor.</description>

      <title>Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against two-dimensional interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that, even within this restricted class of dynamics, the linear stability of an equilibrium does not guarantee its nonlinear stability: equilibria can be metastable. We show that the minimum-energy state accessible to a metastable equilibrium under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be found by solving a combinatorial optimisation problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by our simulations of destabilised metastable equilibria for which turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. To predict the result of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximisation of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of collisionless stellar systems and plasma, and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Lepto-Hadronic Scenarios for TeV Extensions of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows observed in the TeV energy range challenge the simplest Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) interpretation of this emission and are consistent with a single power-law component spanning over eight orders of magnitude in energy. To interpret this generic behaviour in the single-zone approximation without adding further free parameters, we perform an exhaustive parameter space study using the public, time-dependent, multi-messenger transport software AM3. This description accounts for the radiation from non-thermal protons and the lepto-hadronic cascade induced by pp- and p{\gamma}-interactions. We summarise the main scenarios which we have found (SSC, Extended-syn, Proton-syn, pp-cascade, and p{\gamma}-cascade), and discuss their advantages and limitations. We find that possible high-density environments, as may be typical for surrounding molecular cloud material, offer an alternative explanation for producing flat hard (source) spectra up to and beyond energies of 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Investigating binary-neutron-star mergers as production sites of high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The end state of binary-neutron-star (BNS) mergers can manifest conditions to produce high-energy neutrinos. Inspired by the event GW170817, detected in gravitational waves and in optical/infrared emission, we investigate a scenario in which cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated, in a population of BNS mergers, in the energy range that might contribute from the \textit{knee} to the \textit{ankle} of the CR measured spectrum. By taking into account the measured thermal and non-thermal energy density of the photon fields in the source environment as a function of the time after the merger, we model the CR interactions and the consequent neutrino production. We propagate the escaped CR and neutrino fluxes through the extragalactic space and compare the expected diffuse fluxes to the experimental data and current limits. Depending on the CR spectral and composition parameters at acceleration, and on the possible contribution to the \textit{sub-ankle} CR flux, we discuss the predicted diffuse neutrino flux associated to this class of astrophysical objects, as a function of the details of the photon field characterizing the merger stage, including its evolution in time. We constrain the fraction of accelerated baryons in the source site given the BNS merger rate per volume, taking into account at the same time the constraints from the measured CR and neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Wavelength Data Analysis Workflow with gammapy. Constraining the Broadband Emission of FSRQ OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP~313 entered an enhanced activity phase in November 2023 and has undergone multiple flares since then which have motivated the organisation of several large multi-wavelength campaigns, including two deep observations from the hard X-ray telescope NuSTAR. The broadband emission from OP~313 during these two observations is investigated under a new unified analysis framework, with data spanning from optical to gamma rays. Traditional methods for analyzing blazar emissions often rely on proprietary software tailored to specific instruments, making it challenging to integrate and interpret data from multi-wavelength campaigns comprehensively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing gammapy, an open-source Python package, and common data formats originally developed for gamma-ray instrumentation, to perform a consistent multi-instrument analysis. This enables a forward folding approach that fully incorporates source observations, detector responses, and various instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds. The methodology is applied as an example to recent data collected from the distant quasar OP~313. We present a comprehensive data reconstruction and analysis for instruments including the Liverpool Telescope's IO:O detector, Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, and Fermi-LAT. The resulting spectral analysis is validated against the native tools for each instrument. Additionally, a multi-wavelength phenomenological model of the source emission, encompassing optical to gamma-ray bands, is developed, incorporating absorption components across different energy regimes. We introduce and validate a new unified framework for multi-wavelength forward folding data analysis based on gammapy and open data formats, demonstrating its application to spectral data from the quasar OP~313.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer in eccentric black hole - neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole - neutron star $(BH/NS)$ binaries are of interest in many ways: they are intrinsically multi-messenger systems, highly transient, radiate gravitational waves detectable by LIGO, and may produce $\gamma$-ray bursts. Although it has long been assumed that their late-stage orbital evolution is driven entirely by gravitational wave emission, we show here that in certain circumstances, mass transfer from the neutron star onto the black hole can both alter the binary's orbital evolution and significantly reduce the neutron star's mass when the fraction of its mass transferred per orbit is $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$, the neutron star's mass diminishes by order-unity, leading to mergers in which the neutron star mass is exceptionally small. The mass transfer creates a gas disk around the black hole ${\it before}$ merger that can be comparable in mass to the debris remaining after merger, i.e. $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$. These processes are most important when the initial neutron star/black hole mass ratio $q$ is in the range $\approx 0.2 - 0.8$, the orbital semimajor axis is $40 \lesssim a_0/r_g \lesssim 300 $ ($r_g \equiv GM_{\rm B}/c^2$), and the eccentricity is large, $e_0 \gtrsim 0.8$. Systems of this sort may be generated through the dynamical evolution of a triple system, as well as by other means.</description>

      <title>Proof of Shock-cloud interaction within parts of $\gamma$-Cygni region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyze 15 yr data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of $2.149\pm0.005$ and $2.01\pm0.06$, respectively. Combining with high resolution gas observation results, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the $\gamma$-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped CRs illuminating a surrounding Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between these two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of the MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$, spin-down power $\dot{E}$, and the $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$ might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>SN 2014C: a metamorphic supernova exploded in the intricate and hydrogen-rich surroundings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200\AA is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection under centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the physical implications of the centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces on magnetic reconnection in a Kerr black hole background. We find that both forces increase the reconnection rate, though the underlying mechanisms differ substantially. The gravitational force leads to a separation of charge density, breaking the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. In contrast, the centrifugal electromotive force affects the electric current by reducing the effective length of the current sheet. This reduction arises from the non-Euclidean spatial geometry observed by a locally comoving observer with respect to the rotating sheet. This phenomenon amplifies both the transport of charged carriers and the thermal-inertia effect within the current sheet, irrespective of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>NGC 4993, the shell galaxy host of GW170817: constraints on the recent galactic merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.01493v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 4993 is the shell galaxy host of the GRB170817A short gamma-ray burst and the GW170817 gravitational-wave event produced during a binary-neutron-star coalescence. The galaxy shows signs, including the stellar shells, that it has recently accreted a smaller, late-type galaxy. The accreted galaxy might be the original host of the binary neutron star. We measured the positions of the stellar shells of NGC 4993 in an HST/ACS archival image and use the shell positions to constrain the time of the galactic merger. According to the analytical model of the evolution of the shell structure in the expected gravitational potential of NGC 4993, the galactic merger happened at least 200 Myr ago, with a probable time roughly around 400 Myr and the estimates higher than 600 Myr being improbable. This constitutes the lower limit on the age of the binary neutron star, because the host galaxy was probably quenched even before the galactic merger, and the merger has likely shut down the star formation in the accreted galaxy. We roughly estimate the probability that the binary neutron star originates in the accreted galaxy to be around 30%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dense neutrino gas exhibiting angular crossings in the electron lepton number is unstable and develops fast flavor conversions. Instead of assuming an unstable configuration from the onset, we imagine that the system is externally driven toward instability. We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. The system generally sticks to the closest state that is linearly stable, a conclusion that we prove for the first time using quasilinear theory. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.</description>

      <title>Millinovae: A New Class of Transient Supersoft X-ray Sources without a Classical Nova Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some accreting binary systems containing a white dwarf (such as classical novae or persistent supersoft sources) are seen to emit low-energy X-rays with temperatures of ~10^6 K and luminosities exceeding 10^35 erg/s. These X-rays are thought to originate from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface, either caused by a thermonuclear runaway (classical novae) or a high mass-accretion rate that sustains steady nuclear burning (persistent sources). The discovery of transient supersoft X-rays from ASASSN-16oh challenged these ideas, as no clear signatures of mass ejection indicative of a classical nova eruption were detected, and the origin of these X-rays remains controversial. It was unclear whether this star was one of a kind or representative of a larger, as yet undiscovered, group. Here, we present the discovery of 29 stars located in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds exhibiting long-duration, symmetrical optical outbursts similar to that seen in ASASSN-16oh. We observed one of these objects during an optical outburst and found it to be emitting transient supersoft X-rays, while no signatures of mass ejection (indicative of a classical nova eruption) were detected. We therefore propose that these objects form a homogeneous group of transient supersoft X-ray sources, which we dub ``millinovae'' because their optical luminosities are approximately a thousand times fainter than those of ordinary classical novae.</description>

      <title>Applicability criteria of proper charge neutrality and special relativistic MHD models extended by two-fluid effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applicability of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and its generalization to two-fluid models (including the Hall and inertial effects) is systematically investigated by using the method of dominant balance in the two-fluid equations. Although proper charge neutrality or quasi-neutrality is the key assumption for all MHD models, this condition is difficult to be met when both relativistic and inertial effects are taken into account. The range of application for each MHD model is illustrated in the space of dimensionless scale parameters. Moreover, the number of field variables of relativistic Hall MHD (RHMHD) is shown to be greater than that of RMHD and Hall MHD. Nevertheless, the RHMHD equations may be solved at a lower computational cost than RMHD in the limit of cold plasma, since root-finding algorithm, which is the most time-consuming part of the RMHD code, is no longer required to compute the primitive variables.</description>
