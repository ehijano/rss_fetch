      <title>The non-synchronizing primitive groups of degree up to 624</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the methods and results of a classification of the non-synchronizing primitive permutation groups of degree up to 624. We make use of theory and computation to determine the primitive groups of degree up to 624 that are non-separating, which is a necessary, and very often sufficient, condition for a primitive group to be non-synchronizing, and determine exactly which of these non-separating groups are non-synchronizing. A new infinite sequence of non-synchronizing graphs is discovered and new examples of non-separating, but synchronizing, groups are found.</description>

      <title>Growth Rate Gap for Stable Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that stable subgroups of Morse local-to-global groups exhibit a growth gap. That is, the growth rate of an infinite-index stable subgroup is strictly less than the growth rate of the ambient Morse local-to-global group. This generalizes a result of Cordes, Russell, Spriano, and Zalloum in the sense that we removed the additional torsion-free or residually finite assumptions. The Morse local-to-global groups are a very broad class of groups, including mapping class groups, CAT(0) groups, closed $3$-manifold groups, certain relatively hyperbolic groups, virtually solvable groups, etc.</description>

      <title>Left-Invariant Riemannian Distances on Higher-Rank Sol-Type Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the results of ($\textit{Groups, Geom. Dyn.}$, forthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on higher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\mathbf{N}\rtimes \mathbb{R}^k$. We show that the rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific restriction of the metric to $\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough similarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space $SL_k(\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe a family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new technique of $\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.</description>

      <title>The scale function for locally compact groups acting on non-positively curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a totally disconnected, locally compact (t.d.l.c.) group. The scale $s_G(g)$ of $g \in G$ in the sense of Willis is given by the minimum value of the index $|gUg^{-1}:U \cap gUg^{-1}|$ as $U$ ranges over the compact open subgroups; the theory associated to the scale has been very successful in describing general dynamical features of automorphisms of t.d.l.c. groups.
  We focus on the case where $G$ acts properly and continuously by isometries on a geodesic space $X$, where $X$ is complete CAT(0) or proper and Gromov-hyperbolic, and $g \in G$ is hyperbolic. In this context, we find geometric descriptions of the parabolic and contraction groups, tidy subgroups, and structures in the $G$-action that encode the scale, including criteria for $g$ to have scale $1$.</description>

      <title>Salter's question on the image of the Burau representation of $B_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the problem of identifying the conditions under which a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries lies in the image of the Burau representation. Building on this, Salter, in 2021, refined the inquiry to ask whether the central quotient of the Burau image group coincides with the central quotient of a specific subgroup of the unitary group. Assuming the faithfulness of the $B_{4}$ Burau, we solve Salter's question negatively in the case $n=4$ constructing counterexamples. Additionally, we offer two remarks on the faithfulness of the $B_{4}$ Burau. First, we establish that the restriction to the centralizer of a standard generator in $B_{4}$ is faithful modulo $p$ for every prime $p$, extending both Smythe's result in 1979 and Moran's result in 1991. Second, we present a building-theoretic criterion for the faithfulness.</description>

      <title>Constructing Psuedo-$\tau$-fine Precompact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\tau$ be an uncountable cardinal. The notion of a \emph{$\tau$-fine} topological group was introduced in 2021. More recently, H. Zhang et al. generalized this concept by defining pseudo-$\tau$-fine topological groups to study certain factorization properties of continuous functions on topological groups. It is known that $\tau$-fineness cannot coexist with precompactness in topological groups with uncountable character. In this paper, we investigate this problem further. We prove that, in topological groups with uncountable pseudocharacter, precompactness can coexist with pseudo-$\tau$-fineness for some bounded $\tau$ but pseudocompactness can never.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic algebraic regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an 'arithmetic regularity lemma' for groups definable in finite fields, analogous to Tao's 'algebraic regularity lemma' for graphs definable in finite fields. More specifically, we show that, for any $M&gt;0$, any finite field $\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\cdot)$ in $\mathbf{F}$ and definable subset $D\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal definable subgroup $H\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that the following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph $(V,W,xy^{-1}\in D)$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various analogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\in G$, the Fourier coefficient $||\widehat{1}_{H\cap Dg}(\pi)||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation $\pi$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Computing Young's Natural Representations for Generalized Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithmic framework for the computation of explicit representing matrices for all irreducible representations of a generalized symmetric group $\Grin_n$, i.e., a wreath product of cyclic group of order $r$ with the symmetric group $\Symm_n$. The basic building block for this framework is the Specht matrix, a matrix with entries $0$ and $\pm1$, defined in terms of pairs of certain words. Combinatorial objects like Young diagrams and Young tableaus arise naturally from this setup. In the case $r = 1$, we recover Young's natural representations of the symmetric group. For general $r$, a suitable notion of pairs of $r$-words is used to extend the construction to generalized symmetric groups. Separately, for $r = 2$, where $\Grin_n$ is the Weyl group of type $B_n$, a different construction is based on a notion of pairs of biwords.</description>

      <title>A computational study of certain Weyl modules for type $G_2$ in characteristic 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the \texttt{WeylModules} \textsf{GAP} Package, we compute
  structural information about certain Weyl modules for type $G_2$ in
  characteristic $2$. This gives counterexamples to two conjectures
  stated by S.~Donkin in 1990. It also illustrates capabilities of the
  package, which can in principle be applied to Weyl modules for any
  simple, simply-connected algebraic group in any characteristic,
  subject of course to time and space limitations of computational
  resources.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Diagonalizable Matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although a good portion of elementary linear algebra concerns itself with matrices over a field such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, many combinatorial problems naturally surface when we instead work with matrices over a finite field. As some recent work has been done in these areas, we turn our attention to the problem of enumerating the square matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$ that are diagonalizable over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$. This turns out to be significantly more nontrivial than its finite field counterpart due to the presence of zero divisors in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on groups were studied quite recently. Motivated mainly by the fact that weight zero Rota-Baxter operators and averaging operators are Koszul dual to each other, we propose the concept of averaging group and prove that the differentiation of a smooth averaging operator on a Lie group gives an averaging operator on the corresponding Lie algebra. As the free object is one of the most significant objects in a category, we also construct explicitly the free averaging group on a set.</description>

      <title>$F$-birestriction monoids in enriched signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest to $F$-inverse monoids, on the one hand, and to restriction and birestriction monoids, on the other hand, we initiate the study of $F$-birestriction monoids as algebraic structures in the enriched signature $(\cdot, \, ^*, \,^+, \,m,1)$ where the unary operation $m$ maps each element to the maximum element of its $\sigma$-class.
  We find a presentation of the free $F$-birestriction monoid ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ as a birestriction monoid ${\mathcal F}$ over the extended set of generators $X\cup\overline{X^+}$ where $\overline{X^+}$ is a set in a bijection with the free semigroup $X^+$ and encodes the maximum elements of (non-projection) $\sigma$-classes. This enables us to show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ decomposes as the partial action product \mbox{$E({\mathcal I})\rtimes X^*$} of the idempotent semilattice of the universal inverse monoid ${\mathcal I}$ of ${\mathcal F}$ partially acted upon by the free monoid $X^*$. Invoking Sch\"utzenberger graphs, we prove that the word problem for ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ and its strong and perfect analogues is decidable. Furthermore, we show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ does not admit a geometric model based on a quotient of the Margolis-Meakin expansion $M({\mathsf{FG}}(X), X\cup \overline{X^+})$ over the free group ${\mathsf{FG}}(X)$, but the free perfect $X$-generated $F$-birestriction monoid admits such a model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if there is a unique geodesic between each pair of vertices. In this paper we prove that if a finitely generated group admits a Cayley graph which is geodetic, then the group must be virtually free. Before now, it was open whether finitely generated and geodetic implied hyperbolic. In fact we prove something more general: if a quasi-transitive locally finite connected undirected graph is geodetic then it is quasi-isometric to a tree. Our main tool is to define a \emph{boundary} of a graph and understand how the local behaviour influences it when the graph is geodetic. Our results unify, and represent significant progress on, research initiated by Ore, Shapiro, and Madlener and Otto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a method for effectively generating generalised loxodromics in subgroups of graph products, using positive words. This has several consequences for the growth of subsets of these groups. In particular, we show that graph products of groups with strong product set growth properties also share those properties. We additionally show that the set of growth rates of a class of subgroups of any graph product of equationally noetherian groups is well-ordered.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence of endomorphism rings and automorphism groups of periodic Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the endomorphism rings End A and End A' of periodic infinite Abelian groups A and A' are elementarily equivalent if and only if the endomorphism rings of their p-components are elementarily equivalent for all primes p. Additionally, we show that the automorphism groups Aut A and Aut A' of periodic Abelian groups A and A' that do not have 2-components and do not contain cocyclic p-components are elementarily equivalent if and only if, for any prime p, the corresponding p-components A_p and A_p' of A and A' are equivalent in second-order logic if they are not reduced, and are equivalent in second-order logic bounded by the cardinalities of their basic subgroups if they are reduced. For such groups A and A', their automorphism groups are elementarily equivalent if and only if their endomorphism rings are elementarily equivalent, and the automorphism groups of the corresponding p-components for all primes p are elementarily equivalent.</description>

      <title>Conditional Non-Soficity of p-adic Deligne Extensions: on a Theorem of Gohla and Thom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem asks whether every group is sofic, i.e., can be separated by almost-homomorphisms to the symmetric group $Sym(n)$. Similar problems have been asked with respect to almost-homomorphisms to the unitary group $U(n)$, equipped with various norms. One of these problems has been solved for the first time in [De Chiffre, Gelbsky, Lubotzky, Thom, 2020]: some central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of arithmetic lattices $\Gamma$ of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ were shown to be non-Frobenius approximated by almost homomorphisms to $U(n)$. Right after, it was shown that similar results hold with respect to the $p$-Schatten norms in [Lubotzky, Oppenheim, 2020]. It is natural, and has already been suggested in [Chapman, Lubotzky, 2024] and [Gohla, Thom, 2024], to check whether the $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ are also non-sofic. In order to show that they are (also) non-sofic, it suffices:
  (a) To prove that the permutation Cheeger constant of the simplicial complex underlying $\Gamma$ is positive, generalizing [Evra, Kaufman, 2016]. This would imply that $\Gamma$ is stable.
  (b) To prove that the (flexible) stability of $\Gamma$ implies the non-soficity of $\widetilde{\Gamma}$.
  Clause (b) was proved by Gohla and Thom. Here we offer a more algebraic/combinatorial treatment to their theorem.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Binary-Input Multi-Valued Output Optical Cascades for Reversible and Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian GUE/GOE/GSE ensembles of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in the following applications.
  1. We obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutations.
  2. We obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture.
  3. We prove strong convergence of tensor GUE models of $\Gamma$-independence.
  4. We prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. Our results hinge on deep facts about hyperbolic groups. En route, we also establish facts about the structure of random bigeodesics that substantially strengthen prior results.</description>
