      <title>When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic -- arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in $U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$ corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping, as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$ channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim \mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charge density wave fluctuations in the absence of long-range order in a hole-doped kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx 0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds. These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^* \approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting $T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or compete with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Uniform electron benchmark for the first-principles $GW_{0}$-Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical behavior of the Eliashberg equations for phonon-mediated superconductivity, incorporating normal-state self-energy calculations within the consistent $GW_{0}$ approximation. We account for the full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay between electron-phonon $\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.</description>

      <title>Originality of resonance and locking phenomena in $\varphi_{0}$ junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization and interplay of two ferromagnetic resonances in the SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction. One of the resonances that is realized under microwave radiation is the famous Kittel ferromagnetic resonance. The other is the Buzdin ferromagnetic resonance appearing as a result of interaction of superconducting current and ferromagnetic interlayer magnetization. Transformations of one type of resonance to another under variation in the parameters of external radiation and the parameters of the $\varphi_0$ junction open the way to manipulation of the features of ferromagnetic resonances. The combined ferromagnetic resonance that exhibits the features of both resonances is demonstrated too. The 2D-diagrams $\omega_R-I$ for the maximal magnetization component $m_y$ have an interesting intersection points of the Kittel and Buzdin resonances, where the value of $m^{max}_y$ is strongly increased. The obtained results demonstrate reach physics and unique opportunities for various applications.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the self energy and Eliashberg function from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy using the \textsc{xARPES} code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code \textsc{xARPES}.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Frustration Modulation in $\kappa$-type Quantum Spin Liquid Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune. Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in nonbipartite quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconducting diode effect in a topological nano-SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect marks the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has generated significant interest in uncovering the underlying pairing mechanisms and correlated electronic states. While earlier theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of nonlocal Coulomb interactions, in the presence of onsite interactions, on both superconducting and density-wave instabilities using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. We find that the interlayer intraorbital repulsion suppresses the interlayer intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave (SDW) order, while promoting a transition to an interlayer interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state and a mirror-symmetry-breaking charge order. Remarkably, the critical scale of the interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, indicating that the former is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Moreover, the interlayer interorbital repulsion suppresses this $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing but enhances the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing through strengthened interlayer charge fluctuations. In addition, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion favors an in-plane charge-density-wave (CDW) order with wave vector $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings reveal the profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and underscore the robustness of interlayer pairing rooted in the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, thereby advancing the understanding of the intricate correlation effects in bilayer nickelates.</description>
