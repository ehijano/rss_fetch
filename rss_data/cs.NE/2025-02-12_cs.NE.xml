      <title>UAV-assisted Joint Mobile Edge Computing and Data Collection via Matching-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) have been popular research issues. Different from existing works that consider MEC and DC scenarios separately, this paper investigates a multi-UAV-assisted joint MEC-DC system. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the MEC latency and maximize the collected data volume. This problem can be classified as a non-convex mixed integer programming problem that exhibits long-term optimization and dynamics. Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that jointly optimizes the UAV movement, user transmit power, and user association in real time to solve the problem efficiently. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem into an action space-reduced Markov decision process (MDP) and optimize the user association by using a two-phase matching-based association (TMA) strategy. Subsequently, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based approach that integrates the proposed TMA strategy (SAC-TMA) to solve the formulated joint optimization problem collaboratively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SAC-TMA is able to coordinate the two subsystems and can effectively reduce the system latency and improve the data collection volume compared with other benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>EvoFlow: Evolving Diverse Agentic Workflows On The Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the evolution of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems from labor-intensive manual design to partial automation (\textit{e.g.}, prompt engineering, communication topology) and eventually to fully automated design. However, existing agentic automation pipelines often lack LLM heterogeneity and focus on single-objective performance optimization, limiting their potential to combine weaker models for more customized and cost-effective solutions. To address this challenge, we propose EvoFlow, a niching evolutionary algorithm-based framework to automatically search a population of heterogeneous and complexity-adaptive agentic workflows, rather than a single homogeneous, complex workflow. Technically, EvoFlow performs \textit{(1) tag-based retrieval} to extract parent workflows from an agentic population, evolves new workflows through \textit{(2) crossover} and \textit{(3) mutation}, and employs \textit{(4) niching-based selection} to maintain population diversity and quality. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmarks demonstrate that EvoFlow is: \textbf{(I) diverse}, evolving a population of workflows ranging from simple I/O tasks to complex multi-turn interactions; \textbf{(II) high-performing}, outperforming previous handcrafted and automated workflows by $1.23\%\sim29.86\%$; \textbf{(III) economical}, surpassing powerful \llmname{o1-preview} at $12.4\%$ of its inference cost using weaker open-source models.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Driving using Spiking Neural Networks on Dynamic Vision Sensor Data: A Case Study of Traffic Light Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving is a challenging task that has gained broad attention from both academia and industry. Current solutions using convolutional neural networks require large amounts of computational resources, leading to high power consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.</description>

      <title>Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</description>
