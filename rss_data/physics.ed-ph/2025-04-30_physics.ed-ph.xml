      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Assessing Students' Understanding of Uncertainty in Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Courses at a Major Canadian University</title>

Abstract: Over the last five years, the McGill University Office of Science Education (OSE) has partnered with faculty members from the Department of Physics to form an education research group with the aim of charting the progression of student conceptual understanding of uncertainties across their undergraduate degree. The research conducted by this group seeks to provide further insight into the experimental skillset that students gain through undergraduate laboratory courses and noticeable gaps in student understanding that the department could address. In this paper, we evaluate the conceptual understanding of uncertainty using the Concise Data Processing Assessment (CDPA) test. First, we characterize the physics laboratory curriculum at McGill University by evaluating the evolution of CDPA scores across consecutive laboratory courses, and further propose the utilization of this tool for identifying gaps in student understanding. Following the analysis of student responses (N = 2023), we specifically investigate data collected in second-year courses to better understand what student errors reveal about common misconceptions in experimental physics. This more in-depth analysis focuses on data collected from students at the beginning and end of two consecutive experimental laboratory courses that build on each other. By the end of the second course, students have engaged with all the material covered in the CDPA test. Overall results show an upward shift in student understanding of uncertainties over time. Interestingly, we did not observe any change in CDPA scores comparing throughout and post-pandemic scores. Despite the upward shift, many students continue to struggle with uncertainties, basic data analysis, and curve fitting.</description>

      <title>A simulation-heuristics dual-process model for intuitive physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of mental simulation in human physical reasoning is widely acknowledged, but whether it is employed across scenarios with varying simulation costs and where its boundary lies remains unclear. Using a pouring-marble task, our human study revealed two distinct error patterns when predicting pouring angles, differentiated by simulation time. While mental simulation accurately captured human judgments in simpler scenarios, a linear heuristic model better matched human predictions when simulation time exceeded a certain boundary. Motivated by these observations, we propose a dual-process framework, Simulation-Heuristics Model (SHM), where intuitive physics employs simulation for short-time simulation but switches to heuristics when simulation becomes costly. By integrating computational methods previously viewed as separate into a unified model, SHM quantitatively captures their switching mechanism. The SHM aligns more precisely with human behavior and demonstrates consistent predictive performance across diverse scenarios, advancing our understanding of the adaptive nature of intuitive physical reasoning.</description>
