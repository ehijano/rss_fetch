      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ meson masses at the physical point using rooted staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ meson masses at the physical point and in the continuum limit, based on $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors of rooted staggered quarks. Our analysis includes gauge ensembles at the physical pion and kaon masses spread over six lattice spacings in the range [0.064-0.1315]~fm. Our main results read $m_{\eta} = 543.5(5.6)~$MeV and $m_{\eta^{\prime}} = 986(38)~$MeV, consistent with the experimental values. This is an important numerical test that supports the validity of the fourth root procedure used in the staggered quark formalism. This calculation was the first step towards extracting the pseudoscalar transition form factors of the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ mesons that play a crucial role in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$.</description>

      <title>Sampling SU(3) pure gauge theory with Stochastic Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations based on Jarzynski's equality are a well-understood method to compute differences in free energy and also to sample from a target probability distribution without the need to thermalize the system under study. In each evolution, the system starts from a given base distribution at equilibrium and it is gradually driven out-of-equilibrium while evolving towards the target parameters. If the target distribution suffers from long autocorrelation times, this approach represents a promising candidate to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions are conceptually similar to Normalizing Flows and they can be combined into a recently-developed architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this contribution we first focus on the promising scaling with the volume guaranteed by the purely stochastic approach in the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions; then, we define an SNF by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between the out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates, and we analyse the improvement obtained as well as the inherited scaling with the volume. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be systematically improved and how simulations of lattice gauge theories in four dimensions for large volumes and close to criticality can be realistically achieved.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Renormalisation for Meson Mixing and Lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic gradient flow in combination with the short-flow-time expansion provides a computational method where the renormalisation of hadronic matrix elements on the lattice can be simplified to address e.g. the issue that operators with different mass dimension can mix.
  We demonstrate our gradient flow renormalisation procedure by determining matrix elements of four-quark operators describing neutral meson mixing or meson lifetimes. While meson mixing calculations are well-established on the lattice and serve to validate our procedure, a lattice calculation of matrix elements for heavy meson lifetimes is still outstanding. Preliminary results for mesons formed of a charm and strange quark are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalized HMC using Nambu mechanics for lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe a generalization of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm in which the molecular dynamics (MD) steps utilize Nambu generalized Hamiltonian dynamics. Characterized by multiple Hamiltonian functions, this formalism allows me to include forces from non-local objects in the MD evolution while preserving the target probability distribution. In this way, the changes proposed by the MD at one location can be made using instantaneous knowledge of the long-distance behavior of the gauge field to a degree beyond that usually provided by the fermion determinant. This represents a promising method for reducing critical slowing down in lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based learning of Quantum phase transitions in the two-component Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of autoencoders and machine learning methods for detecting and analyzing quantum phase transitions in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model. By leveraging deep learning models such as autoencoders, we investigate latent space representations, reconstruction error analysis, and cluster distance calculations to identify phase boundaries and critical points. The study is supplemented by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE for latent space visualization. The results demonstrate the potential of autoencoders to describe the dynamics of quantum phase transitions.</description>
