      <title>A Basic Overview of Various Stochastic Approaches to Financial Modeling With Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores stochastic modeling approaches to elucidate the intricate dynamics of stock prices and volatility in financial markets. Beginning with an overview of Brownian motion and its historical significance in finance, we delve into various stochastic models, including the classic Black-Scholes framework, the Heston model, fractional Brownian motion, GARCH models, and Levy processes. Through a thorough investigation, we analyze the strengths and limitations of each model in capturing key features of financial time series data. Our empirical analysis focuses on parameter estimation and model calibration using Levy processes, demonstrating their effectiveness in predicting stock returns. However, we acknowledge the need for further refinement and exploration, suggesting potential avenues for future research, such as hybrid modeling approaches. Overall, this study underscores the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding market dynamics and informs decision-making in the financial industry.</description>

      <title>A survey of congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quotient of a poset $P$ is a partial order obtained on the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation $\theta$ on $P$; $\theta$ is then called a congruence if it satisfies certain conditions, which vary according to different theories. The literature on congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets contains a large and profilerating array of approaches, but little in the way of systematic exposition and examination of the subject. We seek to rectify this by surveying the different theories in the literature and providing philosophical discussion on requirements for notions of congruences of posets. We advocate a pluralist approach which recognises that different types of congruence arise naturally in different mathematical situations. There are some notions of congruence which are very general, whilst others capture specific structure which often appears in examples. Indeed, we finish by giving several examples where quotients of posets appear naturally in mathematics.</description>
