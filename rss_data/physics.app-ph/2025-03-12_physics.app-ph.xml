      <title>Active magneto-mechanical metamaterial with the wave transmission and Poisson's ratio controlled via the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of active mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through changes in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved considerable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or alter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation within these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a magneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such a system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for transitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations. Additionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure, facilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency ranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration process. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties and behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications, including robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic metamaterials with tailored magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial in nonreciprocal electromagnetic devices, such as isolators, circulators, and nonreciprocal phase shifters. However, their use is often limited by the need for a uniform bias magnetic field and nonuniform demagnetizing fields, resulting in the restricted aperture of free-space devices, poor temperature stability, and incompatibility with magnetic field-sensitive applications. Alternative methods have been developed to achieve nonreciprocity using active, nonlinear, and time-varying metamaterials, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we present a new approach based on self-biased gyrotropic metamaterials composed of magnetically hard magnets (specifically NdFeB) embedded in a magnetically soft ferrite matrix. In this configuration, the NdFeB magnets provide the magnetic bias for the ferrite matrix, which produces a nonreciprocal response. This gyrotropic metamaterial can exhibit zero net magnetization while producing strong and uniform Faraday rotation over a broad temperature range. Without bias and demagnetizing fields, the aperture of this Faraday rotator can be virtually unlimited. Using this method, we demonstrate uniform 45-degree Faraday rotation and effective isolation across the microwave X-band.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the SiPiC Payload for Photon Detection from Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the SiPiC (SiPM Pinhole Camera) Payload is detailed. This Payload will potentially be integrated in two distinct satellite missions, which will operate in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in a High Altitude Orbit (HAO), respectively. The SiPiC Payload has two main objectives: to test Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) as visible light sensors for stimuli originating from Earth; and to perform an in-orbit validation (IOV) of the new generation of PC104-compliant LabOSat subsystems. Preliminary measurements of the Payload's operational capabilities are performed and discussed. These include payload telemetry analysis, Field-of-View tests for the Earth imaging SiPM subsystem, and performance evaluations of the new LabOSat modules for known devices under test. The measured Angular Field of View (AFOV) for the light gathering SiPM subsystem is $(6.2 \pm 0.5)^{\mathrm{o}}$, which results in a FOV of $(4333 \pm 350)$ km on the surface of the Earth at 40000 km altitude and $(54 \pm 5)$ km at 500 km altitude.</description>

      <title>An integrated widely tunable linear isolator based on electro-optic Autler-Townes splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical isolators are essential for laser protection and robust signal routing, but the incorporation of the necessary magneto-optic (MO) materials in foundries has remained a challenge. As an alternative, several integrated non-magnetic isolators based on acousto-optic (AO) and electro-optic (EO) spatio-temporal modulation have been proposed. Unlike MO isolators, these solutions are wavelength agnostic, though few published demonstrations reach performance that is comparable to MO devices. The most significant remaining concerns are on mitigating undesirable sidebands, lowering power consumption, achieving wide bandwidth or wide tunability, and having a design that is practical to deploy. Here we demonstrate a compact EO optical isolator, using thin film lithium niobate, that produces a very high isolation figure of merit (&gt;32 dB contrast per dB of insertion loss) with THz-scale (8 nm) tunability and, due to its architecture, achieves linear operation with negligible sideband generation. The device uses a 20x smaller interaction length and consumes 64x less power compared to the state-of-the-art EO and AO architectures, without being subject to many of their technical constraints.</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Phase-matching of high harmonic generation in twisted solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in solids could enable attosecond and ultraviolet light sources with high compactness, great controllability and rich functions. However, the HHG process is accompanied by a quite large wavevector mismatch that is uncompensated by any traditional phase-matching method, directly limiting its energy conversion efficiency. Here, we propose an effective strategy for phase-matching of HHG with arbitrary harmonic orders in solids. Two flakes of solids with an interlayer twist induce a nonlinear optical phase that depends on the crystal symmetry, twist angle and harmonic order, which can be accurately designed to compensate for the phase mismatch in HHG. Guided by the twist-phase-matching theory, we achieved a record-high conversion efficiency of $~1.5\times10^{-5}$ for the fifth HHG in twisted hexagonal boron nitride crystals with a total thickness of only 1 ${\mu}m$. Our work establishes a foundation for developing ultrashort-wavelength and ultrafast-pulse laser sources in compact solid-state tabletop systems for fundamental and applied sciences.</description>

      <title>Towards active stiffness control in pattern-forming pneumatic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pattern-forming metamaterials feature microstructures specifically designed to change the material's macroscopic properties due to internal instabilities. These can be triggered either by mechanical deformation or, in the case of active materials, by other external stimuli, such as pneumatic actuation. We study a two-dimensional rectangular lattice microstructure which is pneumatically actuated by non-uniform pressure patterns in its voids, and demonstrate that this actuation may lead toifferent instability patterns. The patterns are associated with a significant reduction in the macroscopic stiffness of the material. The magnitude of this reduction can be controlled by different arrangements of the pressure actuation, thus choosing the precise buckled shape of the microstructure. We develop an analytical model and complement it with computational tests on a two-dimensional plane-strain finite element model. We explain the phenomenon and discuss ways of further developing the concept to actively control the stiffness of materials and structures.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media. The optical properties of the solutions were carefully examined using spectrometry and ellipsometry under two extreme conditions, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of dye solutions. Additionally, we demonstrated using dye molecules to control light propagation through scattering media.
