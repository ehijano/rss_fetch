      <title>The non-Abelian two-dimensional Toda lattice and matrix sine-Gordon equations with self-consistent sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Abelian two-dimensional Toda lattice and matrix sine-Gordon equations with self-consistent sources are established and solved. Two families of quasideterminant solutions are presented for the non-Abelian two-dimensional Toda lattice with self-consistent sources. By employing periodic and quasi-periodic reductions, a matrix sine-Gordon equation with self-consistent sources is constructed for the first time, for which exact solutions in terms of quasideterminants are derived.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Approximation of Fading Mode in Neurooscillator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of two delay differential equations with a large parameter, modeling the association of a pair of neurooscillators. The unknown functions describe the changes in the normalized membrane potentials of neurons over time, with the large parameter characterizing the speed of electrical processes. The first equation is separated from the system and represents a generalized Hutchinson equation. This equation, as known, possesses periodic solutions with high peaks over the period. The second equation is also based on the generalized Hutchinson equation, but with an additional term, linking it to an oscillator satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, it is possible to asymptotically construct the so-called fading neuron mode, which is as follows: for any natural number $n$, one can adjust the parameters of the problem in such a way that the solution is asymptotically close to a periodic function with high peaks over $n$ periods, and then, after a transient process represented by decreasing peaks, becomes asymptotically small.</description>
