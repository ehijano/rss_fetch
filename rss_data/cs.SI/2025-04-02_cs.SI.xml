      <title>Dynamic hashtag recommendation in social media with trend shift detection and adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media platforms results in the generation of vast amounts of user-generated content, which requires efficient methods for categorization and search. Hashtag recommendation systems have emerged as a crucial tool for automatically suggesting relevant hashtags and improving content discoverability. However, existing static models struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic and real-time nature of social media conversations, where new hashtags emerge and existing ones undergo semantic shifts. To address these challenges, this paper presents H-ADAPTS (Hashtag recommendAtion by Detecting and adAPting to Trend Shifts), a BERT-based hashtag recommendation methodology that can detect and adapt to shifts in the main trends and topics underlying social media conversation. Our approach introduces a trend-aware detection mechanism to identify changes in hashtag usage, triggering efficient model adaptation on a (small) set of recent posts. The framework leverages Apache Storm for real-time stream processing, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant analysis of high-velocity social data. Experimental results on two real-world case studies, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election, demonstrate the ability to maintain high recommendation accuracy by adapting to emerging trends. Our methodology significantly outperforms existing solutions, ensuring timely and relevant hashtag recommendations in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Navigating Decentralized Online Social Networks: An Overview of Technical and Societal Challenges in Architectural Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized online social networks have evolved from experimental stages to operating at unprecedented scale, with broader adoption and more active use than ever before. Platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, Hive, and Nostr have seen notable growth, particularly following the wave of user migration after Twitter's acquisition in October 2022. As new platforms build upon earlier decentralization architectures and explore novel configurations, it becomes increasingly important to understand how these foundations shape both the direction and limitations of decentralization. Prior literature primarily focuses on specific architectures, resulting in fragmented views that overlook how different social networks encounter similar challenges and complement one another. This paper fills that gap by presenting a comprehensive view of the current decentralized online social network landscape. We examine four major architectures: federated, peer-to-peer, blockchain, and hybrid, tracing their evolution and evaluating how they support core social networking functions. By linking these architectural aspects to real-world cases, our work provides a foundation for understanding the societal implications of decentralized social platforms.</description>

      <title>A Regret-Aware Framework for Effective Social Media Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Media Advertisement has emerged as an effective approach for promoting the brands of a commercial house. Hence, many of them have started using this medium to maximize the influence among the users and create a customer base. In recent times, several companies have emerged as Influence Provider who provides views of advertisement content depending on the budget provided by the commercial house. In this process, the influence provider tries to exploit the information diffusion phenomenon of a social network, and a limited number of highly influential users are chosen and activated initially. Due to diffusion phenomenon, the hope is that the advertisement content will reach a large number of people. Now, consider that a group of advertisers is approaching an influence provider with their respective budget and influence demand. Now, for any advertiser, if the influence provider provides more or less influence, it will be a loss for the influence provider. It is an important problem from the point of view of influence provider, as it is important to allocate the seed nodes to the advertisers so that the loss is minimized. In this paper, we study this problem, which we formally referred to as Regret Minimization in Social Media Advertisement Problem. We propose a noble regret model that captures the aggregated loss encountered by the influence provider while allocating the seed nodes. We have shown that this problem is a computationally hard problem to solve. We have proposed three efficient heuristic solutions to solve our problem, analyzed to understand their time and space requirements. They have been implemented with real world social network datasets, and several experiments have been conducted and compared to many baseline methods.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Causal Mechanism of Political Opinion Dynamics: A Model of Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Community-Bounded Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Growing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data.</description>

      <title>Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal structures of large organizations determine much of what occurs inside including the way in which tasks are performed, the workers that perform them, and the mobility of those workers within the organization. However, regarding this latter process, most of the theoretical and modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large US government organization, we introduce a new model to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers that change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past co-workers. In this organization, 34\% of all moves lead to worker reunions, a percentage well-above expectation. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations.</description>

      <title>Producing population-level estimates of internal displacement in Ukraine using GPS mobile phone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly 110 million people are forcibly displaced people worldwide. However, estimating the scale and patterns of internally displaced persons in real time, and developing appropriate policy responses, remain hindered by traditional data streams. They are infrequently updated, costly and slow. Mobile phone location data can overcome these limitations, but only represent a population segment. Drawing on an anonymised large-scale, high-frequency dataset of locations from 25 million mobile devices, we propose an approach to leverage mobile phone data and produce population-level estimates of internal displacement. We use this approach to quantify the extent, pace and geographic patterns of internal displacement in Ukraine during the early stages of the Russian invasion in 2022. Our results produce reliable population-level estimates, enabling real-time monitoring of internal displacement at detailed spatio-temporal resolutions. Accurate estimations are crucial to support timely and effective humanitarian and disaster management responses, prioritising resources where they are most needed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stakeholder Disaster Insights from Social Media Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, social media has emerged as a primary channel for users to promptly share feedback and issues during disasters and emergencies, playing a key role in crisis management. While significant progress has been made in collecting and analyzing social media content, there remains a pressing need to enhance the automation, aggregation, and customization of this data to deliver actionable insights tailored to diverse stakeholders, including the press, police, EMS, and firefighters. This effort is essential for improving the coordination of activities such as relief efforts, resource distribution, and media communication. This paper presents a methodology that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to enhance disaster response and management. Our approach combines classification techniques with generative AI to bridge the gap between raw user feedback and stakeholder-specific reports. Social media posts shared during catastrophic events are analyzed with a focus on user-reported issues, service interruptions, and encountered challenges. We employ full-spectrum LLMs, using analytical models like BERT for precise, multi-dimensional classification of content type, sentiment, emotion, geolocation, and topic. Generative models such as ChatGPT are then used to produce human-readable, informative reports tailored to distinct audiences, synthesizing insights derived from detailed classifications. We compare standard approaches, which analyze posts directly using prompts in ChatGPT, to our advanced method, which incorporates multi-dimensional classification, sub-event selection, and tailored report generation. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative metrics, such as text coherence scores and latent representations, and qualitative assessments by automated tools and field experts, delivering precise insights for diverse disaster response stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Agentic Multimodal AI for Hyperpersonalized B2B and B2C Advertising in Competitive Markets: An AI-Driven Competitive Advertising Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing use of foundation models (FMs) in real-world applications demands adaptive, reliable, and efficient strategies for dynamic markets. In the chemical industry, AI-discovered materials drive innovation, but commercial success hinges on market adoption, requiring FM-driven advertising frameworks that operate in-the-wild. We present a multilingual, multimodal AI framework for autonomous, hyper-personalized advertising in B2B and B2C markets. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal reasoning, and adaptive persona-based targeting, our system generates culturally relevant, market-aware ads tailored to shifting consumer behaviors and competition. Validation combines real-world product experiments with a Simulated Humanistic Colony of Agents to model consumer personas, optimize strategies at scale, and ensure privacy compliance. Synthetic experiments mirror real-world scenarios, enabling cost-effective testing of ad strategies without risky A/B tests. Combining structured retrieval-augmented reasoning with in-context learning (ICL), the framework boosts engagement, prevents market cannibalization, and maximizes ROAS. This work bridges AI-driven innovation and market adoption, advancing multimodal FM deployment for high-stakes decision-making in commercial marketing.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Interaction Matters: Dynamic Hypergraph Neural Networks for Epidemic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing need for effective epidemic modeling has driven advancements in capturing the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Traditional models, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and graph-based approaches often fail to account for higher-order interactions and the nuanced structure pattern inherent in human contact networks. This study introduces a novel Human Contact-Tracing Hypergraph Neural Network framework tailored for epidemic modeling called EpiDHGNN, leveraging the capabilities of hypergraphs to model intricate, higher-order relationships from both location and individual level. Both real-world and synthetic epidemic data are used to train and evaluate the model. Results demonstrate that EpiDHGNN consistently outperforms baseline models across various epidemic modeling tasks, such as source detection and forecast, by effectively capturing the higher-order interactions and preserving the complex structure of human interactions. This work underscores the potential of representing human contact data as hypergraphs and employing hypergraph-based methods to improve epidemic modeling, providing reliable insights for public health decision-making.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Conversations with Data: How Data Journalism Affects Online Comments in the New York Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users in the data age have access to more data than ever before, but little is known how they interact with it. Using transparency and multimedia, data journalism (DJ) lets users explore and interpret data on their own. This study examines how DJ affects online comments as a case study of user interactions with data. The corpus comprises 6,400 stories and their comment sections from the DJ and other sections of the New York Times, from 2014-2022. Results indicate that DJ is positively associated with higher level of interactivity between the users. This relationship is mediated by statistical information, information sources, and static visualizations. However, there is a low level of interactivity with the content; consequently, only part of the users use it. The results demonstrate how data accessibility through DJ engages the users in conversation. According to deliberation theory, this creates a conducive environment for democratic processes.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Joint Predictive Embedding and Bayesian Inference in Graph Self Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</description>
