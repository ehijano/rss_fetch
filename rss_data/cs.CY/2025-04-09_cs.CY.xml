      <title>Resurrecting Socrates in the Age of AI: A Study Protocol for Evaluating a Socratic Tutor to Support Research Question Development in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating research questions is a foundational yet challenging academic skill, one that generative AI systems often oversimplify by offering instant answers at the expense of student reflection. This protocol lays out a study grounded in constructivist learning theory to evaluate a novel AI-based Socratic Tutor, designed to foster cognitive engagement and scaffold research question development in higher education. Anchored in dialogic pedagogy, the tutor engages students through iterative, reflective questioning, aiming to promote System 2 thinking and counteract overreliance on AI-generated outputs. In a quasi-experimental design, approximately 80 German pre-service biology teacher students will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an AI Socratic Tutor condition and an uninstructed chatbot control. Across multiple cycles, students are expected to formulate research questions based on background texts, with quality assessed through double-blind expert review. The study also examines transfer of skills to novel phenomena and captures student perceptions through mixed-methods analysis, including surveys, interviews and reflective journals. This study aims to advance the understanding of how generative AI can be pedagogically aligned to support, not replace, human cognition and offers design principles for human-AI collaboration in education.</description>

      <title>Assessing Computer Science Student Attitudes Towards AI Ethics and Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity and importance-both as a domain within broader computing research and in society at large-increasing focus will need to be paid to the ethical governance of this emerging technology. The attitudes and competencies with respect to AI ethics and policy among post-secondary students studying computer science (CS) are of particular interest, as many of these students will go on to play key roles in the development and deployment of future AI innovations. Despite this population of computer scientists being at the forefront of learning about and using AI tools, their attitudes towards AI remain understudied in the literature. In an effort to begin to close this gap, in fall 2024 we fielded a survey ($n=117$) to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in CS courses at a large public university in the United States to assess their attitudes towards the nascent fields of AI ethics and policy. Additionally, we conducted one-on-one follow-up interviews with 13 students to elicit more in-depth responses on topics such as the use of AI tools in the classroom, ethical impacts of AI, and government regulation of AI. In this paper, we describe the findings of both the survey and interviews, drawing parallels and contrasts to broader public opinion polling in the United States. We conclude by evaluating the implications of CS student attitudes on the future of AI education and governance.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness and Generalization of Race Representations for Debiasing High-Stakes Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating biases is critical for the adoption of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making. We introduce Admissions and Hiring, decision tasks with hypothetical applicant profiles where a person's race can be inferred from their name, as simplified test beds for racial bias. We show that Gemma 2B Instruct and LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct exhibit strong biases. Gemma grants admission to 26% more White than Black applicants, and LLaMA hires 60% more Asian than White applicants. We demonstrate that these biases are resistant to prompt engineering: multiple prompting strategies all fail to promote fairness. In contrast, using distributed alignment search, we can identify "race subspaces" within model activations and intervene on them to debias model decisions. Averaging the representation across all races within the subspaces reduces Gemma's bias by 37-57%. Finally, we examine the generalizability of Gemma's race subspaces, and find limited evidence for generalization, where changing the prompt format can affect the race representation. Our work suggests mechanistic approaches may provide a promising venue for improving the fairness of LLMs, but a universal race representation remains elusive.</description>

      <title>Assessing employment and labour issues implicated by using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter critiques the dominant reductionist approach in AI and work studies, which isolates tasks and skills as replaceable components. Instead, it advocates for a systemic perspective that emphasizes the interdependence of tasks, roles, and workplace contexts. Two complementary approaches are proposed: an ethnographic, context-rich method that highlights how AI reconfigures work environments and expertise; and a relational task-based analysis that bridges micro-level work descriptions with macro-level labor trends. The authors argue that effective AI impact assessments must go beyond predicting automation rates to include ethical, well-being, and expertise-related questions. Drawing on empirical case studies, they demonstrate how AI reshapes human-technology relations, professional roles, and tacit knowledge practices. The chapter concludes by calling for a human-centric, holistic framework that guides organizational and policy decisions, balancing technological possibilities with social desirability and sustainability of work.</description>

      <title>From Stability to Inconsistency: A Study of Moral Preferences in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into our daily lives, it becomes crucial to understand their implicit biases and moral tendencies. To address this, we introduce a Moral Foundations LLM dataset (MFD-LLM) grounded in Moral Foundations Theory, which conceptualizes human morality through six core foundations. We propose a novel evaluation method that captures the full spectrum of LLMs' revealed moral preferences by answering a range of real-world moral dilemmas. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art models have remarkably homogeneous value preferences, yet demonstrate a lack of consistency.</description>

      <title>Human Trust in AI Search: A Large-Scale Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power generative search engines which, in turn, drive human information seeking and decision making at scale. The extent to which humans trust generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can therefore influence what we buy, how we vote and our health. Unfortunately, no work establishes the causal effect of generative search designs on human trust. Here we execute ~12,000 search queries across seven countries, generating ~80,000 real-time GenAI and traditional search results, to understand the extent of current global exposure to GenAI search. We then use a preregistered, randomized experiment on a large study sample representative of the U.S. population to show that while participants trust GenAI search less than traditional search on average, reference links and citations significantly increase trust in GenAI, even when those links and citations are incorrect or hallucinated. Uncertainty highlighting, which reveals GenAI's confidence in its own conclusions, makes us less willing to trust and share generative information whether that confidence is high or low. Positive social feedback increases trust in GenAI while negative feedback reduces trust. These results imply that GenAI designs can increase trust in inaccurate and hallucinated information and reduce trust when GenAI's certainty is made explicit. Trust in GenAI varies by topic and with users' demographics, education, industry employment and GenAI experience, revealing which sub-populations are most vulnerable to GenAI misrepresentations. Trust, in turn, predicts behavior, as those who trust GenAI more click more and spend less time evaluating GenAI search results. These findings suggest directions for GenAI design to safely and productively address the AI "trust gap."</description>

      <title>Societal Impacts Research Requires Benchmarks for Creative Composition Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models that are capable of automating cognitive tasks represent a pivotal technological shift, yet their societal implications remain unclear. These systems promise exciting advances, yet they also risk flooding our information ecosystem with formulaic, homogeneous, and potentially misleading synthetic content. Developing benchmarks grounded in real use cases where these risks are most significant is therefore critical. Through a thematic analysis using 2 million language model user prompts, we identify creative composition tasks as a prevalent usage category where users seek help with personal tasks that require everyday creativity. Our fine-grained analysis identifies mismatches between current benchmarks and usage patterns among these tasks. Crucially, we argue that the same use cases that currently lack thorough evaluations can lead to negative downstream impacts. This position paper argues that benchmarks focused on creative composition tasks is a necessary step towards understanding the societal harms of AI-generated content. We call for greater transparency in usage patterns to inform the development of new benchmarks that can effectively measure both the progress and the impacts of models with creative capabilities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Tools: Generative AI as Epistemic Infrastructure in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures worldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet current discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic infrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI systems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on human epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following a value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation of two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their impact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for long-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems inadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster epistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that prioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the paper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in education, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while upholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes -- recommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core educational values and maintains human epistemic agency.</description>

      <title>A Year of the DSA Transparency Database: What it (Does Not) Reveal About Platform Moderation During the 2024 European Parliament Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms face heightened risks during major political events; yet, how platforms adapt their moderation practices in response remains unclear. The Digital Services Act Transparency Database offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study content moderation at scale, enabling researchers and policymakers to assess platforms' compliance and effectiveness. Herein, we analyze 1.58 billion self-reported moderation actions taken by eight large social media platforms during an extended period of eight months surrounding the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our findings reveal a lack of adaptation in moderation strategies, as platforms did not exhibit significant changes in their enforcement behaviors surrounding the elections. This raises concerns about whether platforms adapted their moderation practices at all, or if structural limitations of the database concealed possible adjustments. Moreover, we found that noted transparency and accountability issues persist nearly a year after initial concerns were raised. These results highlight the limitations of current self-regulatory approaches and underscore the need for stronger enforcement and data access mechanisms to ensure that online platforms uphold their responsibility in safeguarding democratic processes.</description>

      <title>Analyzing How Text-to-Image Models Represent Nationalities in Everyday Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to investigate how a popular Text-to-Image (T2I) model represents people from 208 different nationalities when prompted to generate images of individuals performing typical everyday tasks. Two scenarios were developed, and images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities. The results show that in one scenario, the majority of images, and in the other, a substantial portion, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. This suggests that the model emphasizes such characteristics even when they are impractical for the given task. A statistically significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and the regions associated with the specified countries. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain areas, particularly the Middle East &amp; North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP was used to measure alignment scores between generated images and various prompts and captions. The findings indicate statistically significant higher scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario. The study also examined revised prompts (additional contextual information automatically added to the original input prompts) to assess their potential influence on how individuals are represented in the generated images, finding that the word "traditional" was commonly added to revised prompts. These findings provide valuable insights into how T2I models represent individuals from various countries and highlight potential areas for improvement in future models.</description>

      <title>Beyond authorship: Analyzing contributions in PLOS ONE and the challenges of appropriate attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of authorship attributions in scientific publications, focusing on the fairness and precision of individual contributions within academic works. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes 81,823 publications from the journal PLOS ONE , covering the period from January 2018 to June 2023. It examines the authorship attributions within these publications to try and determine the prevalence of inappropriate authorship. It also investigates the demographic and professional profiles of affected authors, exploring trends and potential factors contributing to inaccuracies in authorship. Findings Surprisingly, 9.14% of articles feature at least one author with inappropriate authorship, affecting over 14,000 individuals (2.56% of the sample). Inappropriate authorship is more concentrated in Asia, Africa, and specific European countries like Italy. Established researchers with significant publication records and those affiliated with companies or nonprofits show higher instances of potential monetary authorship. Research limitations Our findings are based on contributions as declared by the authors, which implies a degree of trust in their transparency. However, this reliance on self-reporting may introduce biases or inaccuracies into the dataset. Further research could employ additional verification methods to enhance the reliability of the findings. Practical implications These findings have significant implications for journal publishers, highlighting the necessity for robust control mechanisms to ensure the integrity of authorship attributions. Moreover, researchers must exercise discernment in determining when to acknowledge a contributor and when to include them in the author list. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining the credibility and fairness of academic publications. Originality/value This study contributes to an understanding of critical issues within academic authorship, shedding light on the prevalence and impact of inappropriate authorship attributions. By calling for a nuanced approach to ensure accurate credit is given where it is due, the study underscores the importance of upholding ethical standards in scholarly publishing.</description>

      <title>Understanding Users' Security and Privacy Concerns and Attitudes Towards Conversational AI Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of conversational AI platforms has introduced new security and privacy risks. While these risks and their mitigation strategies have been extensively researched from a technical perspective, users' perceptions of these platforms' security and privacy remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of over 2.5M user posts from the r/ChatGPT Reddit community to understand users' security and privacy concerns and attitudes toward conversational AI platforms. Our qualitative analysis reveals that users are concerned about each stage of the data lifecycle (i.e., collection, usage, and retention). They seek mitigations for security vulnerabilities, compliance with privacy regulations, and greater transparency and control in data handling. We also find that users exhibit varied behaviors and preferences when interacting with these platforms. Some users proactively safeguard their data and adjust privacy settings, while others prioritize convenience over privacy risks, dismissing privacy concerns in favor of benefits, or feel resigned to inevitable data sharing. Through qualitative content and regression analysis, we discover that users' concerns evolve over time with the evolving AI landscape and are influenced by technological developments and major events. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for users, platforms, enterprises, and policymakers to enhance transparency, improve data controls, and increase user trust and adoption.</description>

      <title>ClarityEthic: Explainable Moral Judgment Utilizing Contrastive Ethical Insights from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise and widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their safety is crucial to prevent harm to humans and promote ethical behaviors. However, directly assessing value valence (i.e., support or oppose) by leveraging large-scale data training is untrustworthy and inexplainable. We assume that emulating humans to rely on social norms to make moral decisions can help LLMs understand and predict moral judgment. However, capturing human values remains a challenge, as multiple related norms might conflict in specific contexts. Consider norms that are upheld by the majority and promote the well-being of society are more likely to be accepted and widely adopted (e.g., "don't cheat,"). Therefore, it is essential for LLM to identify the appropriate norms for a given scenario before making moral decisions. To this end, we introduce a novel moral judgment approach called \textit{ClarityEthic} that leverages LLMs' reasoning ability and contrastive learning to uncover relevant social norms for human actions from different perspectives and select the most reliable one to enhance judgment accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in moral judgment tasks. Moreover, human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations that support the judgments. This suggests that modeling human moral judgment with the emulating humans moral strategy is promising for improving the ethical behaviors of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Randomness, Not Representation: The Unreliability of Evaluating Cultural Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on the 'cultural alignment' of Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged in response to growing interest in understanding representation across diverse stakeholders. Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment through survey-based assessments that borrow from social science methodologies often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current survey-based evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current survey-based approaches to evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs and highlight a need for systematic robustness checks and red-teaming for evaluation results. Data and code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/akhan02/cultural-dimension-cover-letters and https://github.com/ariba-k/llm-cultural-alignment-evaluation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Opinion Polarization in Short Video Browsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of Opinion Polarization (OP) in the increasingly prevalent context of short video browsing, a dominant medium in the contemporary digital landscape with significant influence on public opinion and social dynamics. We investigate the effects of OP on user perceptions and behaviors in short video consumption, and find that traditional user feedback signals, such as like and browsing duration, are not suitable for detecting and measuring OP. Recognizing this problem, our study employs Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a novel, noninvasive approach to assess the neural processing of perception and cognition related to OP. Our user study reveals that OP notably affects users' sentiments, resulting in measurable changes in brain signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of using EEG signals to predict users' exposure to polarized short video content. By exploring the relationships between OP, brain signals, and user behavior, our research offers a novel perspective in understanding the dynamics of short video browsing and proposes an innovative method for quantifying the impact of OP in this context.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Challenging Multiple-Choice Questions for Vision Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of vision language models (VLMs) demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, current visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks often depend on open-ended questions, making accurate evaluation difficult due to the variability in natural language responses. To address this, we introduce AutoConverter, an agentic framework that automatically converts these open-ended questions into multiple-choice format, enabling objective evaluation while reducing the costly multiple-choice question creation process. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoConverter can generate correct and challenging multiple-choice questions, with VLMs demonstrating consistently similar or lower accuracy on these questions compared to human-created ones. Using AutoConverter, we construct VMCBench, a benchmark created by transforming 20 existing VQA datasets into a unified multiple-choice format, totaling 9,018 questions. We comprehensively evaluate 33 state-of-the-art VLMs on VMCBench, setting a new standard for scalable, consistent, and reproducible VLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarr\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.</description>

      <title>Rotated Bitboards and Reinforcement Learning in Computer Chess and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist several techniques for representing the chess board inside the computer. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command. We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct.
  The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance. This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample effciency" in reinforcement learning.
  In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. We also discuss future research and the potential for such methods for ecological economic planning.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>
