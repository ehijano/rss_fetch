      <title>Evaluation of Vortex Criteria by Virtue of the Quadruple Decomposition of Velocity Gradient Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the velocity gradient tensor, we investigate in this paper the physical interpretation and limitations of four vortex criteria: $\omega$, $Q$, $\varDelta$ and $\lambda_{ci}$, and reveal the actual physical meaning of vortex patterns which are usually illustrated by level sets of various vortex criteria. A quadruple decomposition based on the normality of the velocity gradient tensor is proposed for the first time, which resolves the motion of a fluid element into dilation, axial stretch along the normal frame, in-plane distortion, and simple shear, in order to clarify the kinematical interpretation of various vortex criteria. The mean rotation characterized by the vorticity $\omega$ always consists of simple shear; the $Q$-criterion can reflect the strength of net rotation within the invariant plane relative to the axial stretch of a fluid element, and it is a sufficient but unnecessary condition for the existence of net rotation; the $\varDelta$-criterion can exactly identify the existence of net rotation, but it is not the strength of net rotation; in the case that net rotation exists, $\lambda_{ci}$ characterize its absolute strength. net rotation is the total effect of the normal rotation within the invariant plane and the simple shear, where the former is the most basic rotation. The newly introduced quadruple decomposition can improve our understanding of vortices in fluids and their motions.</description>

      <title>Two-layer baroclinic turbulence with arbitrary layer depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While heat transport by baroclinic turbulence in oceans and planetary atmospheres is well described by a two-layer model, the relative depth of the two layers varies greatly depending on the situation of interest, making it an important parameter governing the transport properties of the system. Focusing on the low-drag turbulent regime, we extend the vortex-gas scaling theory to address the case of arbitrary layer depths. To wit, we map the arbitrary-layer-depth system onto an equivalent equal-depth system with rescaled parameters, establishing the asymptotic validity of the mapping for weak bottom drag. This approach leads to quantitative predictions for the turbulent transport by two-layer baroclinic turbulence with arbitrary layer depths, without additional free parameters. We validate these predictions using an extended suite of numerical simulations with either linear or quadratic bottom drag.</description>

      <title>Tunable drag drop via flow-induced snap-through in origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage the snap-through response of a bistable origami mechanism to induce a discontinuous evolution of drag with flow speed. The transition between equilibrium states is passively actuated by airflow, and we demonstrate that large shape reconfiguration over a small increment of flow velocity leads to a pronounced and sudden drop in drag. Moreover, we show that systematically varying the geometrical and mechanical properties of the origami unit enables the tuning of this drag discontinuity and the critical speed and loading at which it occurs. Experimental results are supported by a theoretical aero-elastic model, which further guides inverse design to identify the combination of structural origami parameters for targeted drag collapse. This approach sheds light on harnessing origami-inspired mechanisms for efficient passive drag control in a fluid environment, applicable for load alleviation or situations requiring swift transitions in aerodynamic performances.</description>

      <title>Higher DNS-resolution requirements for expanded overlap region and confirmation of a convergence criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) stand out as formidable tools in studying turbulent flows. Despite the fact that the achievable Reynolds number remains lower than those available through experimental methods, DNS offers a distinct advantage: the complete knowledge of the velocity field, facilitating the evaluation of any desired quantity. This capability should extend to compute derivatives. Among the classic functions requiring derivatives is the indicator function, $\Xi(y^+) = y^+\frac{{\rm d}\overline{U}_x^+}{{\rm d}y^+}$. This function encapsulates the wall-normal derivative of the streamwise velocity, with its value possibly influenced by mesh size and its spatial distribution. The indicator function serves as a fundamental element in unraveling the interplay between inner and outer layers in wall-bounded flows, including the overlap region, and forms a critical underpinning in turbulence modeling. Our investigation reveals a sensitivity of the indicator function on the utilized mesh distributions, prompting inquiries into the conventional mesh-sizing paradigms for DNS applications.</description>

      <title>Towards high-order consistency and convergence of conservative SPH approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) offers distinct advantages for modeling many engineering problems, yet achieving high-order consistency in its conservative formulation remains to be addressed. While zero- and higher-order consistencies can be obtained using particle-pair differences and the kernel gradient correction (KGC) approaches, respectively, for SPH gradient approximations, their applicability for discretizing conservation laws in practical simulations is limited due to their non-conservative feature. Although the standard anti-symmetric SPH approximation is able to achieve conservative zero-order consistency through particle relaxation, its straightforward extensions with the KGC fail to satisfy either zero- or higher-order consistency. In this paper, we propose the reverse KGC (RKGC) formulation, which is conservative and able to precisely satisfy both zero- and first-order consistencies when particles are relaxed based on the KGC matrix. Extensive numerical examples show that the new formulation considerably improves the accuracy of the Lagrangian SPH method. In particular, it is able to resolve the long-standing high-dissipation issue for simulating free-surface flows. Furthermore, with fully relaxed particles, it enhances the accuracy of the Eulerian SPH method even when the ratio between the smoothing length and the particle spacing is considerably reduced. Indeed, the reverse KGC formulation holds the potential for the extension to even higher-order consistencies. However, addressing the corresponding particle relaxation problem remains a pending challenge.</description>

      <title>The potential fluctuation and its interfacial phenomena in molecular, micro, macro, and cosmic flow instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow instabilities play important roles in a wide range of engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows, ranging from supernova explosion in crab nebula, formation of clouds in sky, waves on ocean, to inertial confinement fusion capsules, making fusion energy a viable alternative energy source in the future. The potential for life is directly related to flow instability mixing as well. Previous researchers have focused on developed stages of flow instabilities by assuming sine wave interface between fluids in the flow instabilities. No scientific research has been reported to investigate the origin of flow instabilities. The paper advances a new physics concept, potential fluctuation in flow based on the conservation of mass, which presents potential oscillatory sine wave surface in the spatial and temporal dimensions at the interface of flow instabilities. Potential fluctuation is decided by the two densities and velocities in the flow as indicated by the relation of continuity. Even before the flow instabilities start to develop, potential fluctuation has already internally existed in flow. It is only decided by the densities and velocities of the two moving fluids and is not related to the surface topography of the boundary of flows in the flow instability. It is the gene of flow instability. The paper presents breakthrough of understanding of micro, macro, and cosmic flow instabilities.</description>

      <title>High-order Shallow Water Equations (HSWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most coastal flows are turbulent and cannot be accurately described by shallow water equations. This paper presents a novel theory for characterizing accelerated coastal flows, offering improved representation of turbulent flows. The theory builds on second-order approximation long-wave theory, utilizing a dual-velocity vector approach (comprising a mean velocity and a turbulence-induced distortion velocity) in the primary flow directions. The resulting second-order long-wave model consists of five equations, which is one fewer than the number derived from averaged models that incorporate turbulence as reported in the literature, yet it retains equivalent physical and hydrodynamic characteristics. The eigenstructure of the model is presented. This modeling approach shows promise for addressing a variety of engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Flow-Induced Vibration of Flexible Hydrofoil Within Cavitating Turbulent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow-induced vibration and cavitation dynamics of three-dimensional flow past a cantilever flexible hydrofoil are investigated using a large eddy simulation (LES) model, a homogeneous mixture cavitation model and the structural modes superposition method. The present work aims to explore a potential mechanism responsible for a propeller singing behavior, and thus focuses on the synchronized hydroelastic coupling among the pressure pulsation inside the flow field, the cavitation generation and the structural vibration. To begin, we validate the tip vortex dynamics of a flexible hydrofoil against the available experimental. Our results demonstrate that the tip vortex shedding and the blade vibration are responsible for the intense peak in the low-frequency tonal components of the noise source, and the trailing-edge vortex shedding induces broadband components. Additionally, the generation of sheet cavitation induces considerable synchronized hydrofoil vibration (subjected to a flutter-like response), and affects the pressure fluctuations in the flow field, which further dominate the features of the underwater noise sources. It is suggested that the cavitation behavior and structural vibrations co-dominate the characteristics of singing noise from a propeller blade.</description>

      <title>Fine Structures Roll up in the Flow of Film Boiling at High Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Film boiling has practical applications in the current technology including steam power plants, cooling of electronic devices and emergency cooling systems. A finite difference/front tracking method is used to simulate film boiling at high density ratios on a horizontal plate subject to a constant wall heat flux. The grid resolution is relatively high (768 grids per width of the domain). The flow is dominated by Rayleigh-Taylor instability as well as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The flow structure includes the roll up of the interface between the gas and liquid. This happens at high density ratio (1000) where the difference between the gas and the liquid velocities across the interface is large. The jump in tangential velocity is an order of magnitude smaller at a lower density ratio (100). Hence, there is no roll up at lower density ratio. The flow is also influenced by vortex development as a result of the baroclinic term in the vorticity transport equation. The density gradient is large at the interface at high density ratio which tends to increase the baroclinic term. The plot of pressure gradient and density gradient shows that they are not parallel in the roll up regions. As a result, vortices in small scales develop that shed in the gas phase. The plot of the enstrophy with time shows that it shows smooth variation that match for two grid resolutions, however at a specific time enstrophies become spiky, and they depart from each other at two grid resolutions. The spiky behavior of enstrophy is due to vortex shedding in the roll up region.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Flow Simulation of Blow-by and Fuel-in-Oil Dilution via the Piston Ring Pack Using the CFD Level-Set Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern diesel engines temporarily use a very late post-injection in the combustion cycle to either generate heat for a diesel particulate filter regeneration or purge a lean NOx trap. In some configurations, unburned fuel is left at the cylinder walls and is transported via the piston rings toward the lower crankcase region, where fuel may dilute the oil. Reduced oil lubrication shortens the oil service intervals and increases friction. Beside diesel fuel, this problem may also occur for other types of liquid fuels such as alcohols and e-fuels. The exact transport mechanism of the unburned fuel via the piston ring pack grooves and cylinder wall is hard to measure experimentally, motivating numerical flow simulation in early design stages for an in-depth understanding of the involved processes. A new CFD simulation methodology has been developed to investigate the transient, compressible, multiphase flow around the piston ring pack, through the gap between piston and liner, and its impact on fuel or oil transport. The modern level-set approach is used for the multiphase physics, which directly captures the sharp interface between blow-by gas and fuel or oil. Transient blow-by and two-phase flow simulations have been extensively applied to a Ford 2.0L I4 diesel test engine. The results confirm the validity of the flow compressibility assumption and highlight the sensitivity of the fuel leakage regarding piston sealing ring movement and highly resolved meshes for the multiphase flow. Based on the simulation results, design recommendations for piston and piston ring geometry are provided to reduce the fuel transport toward the crankcase.</description>

      <title>Changes in boiling controlled by molar concentration-dependent diffusion of surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boiling is a prevalent phase-change process that plays a vital role in facilitating efficient heat transfer from a heating surface. While this heat transfer mechanism is generally effective, a rapid increase in surface temperature can lead to hydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in a boiling crisis. Previous studies have shown that surfactants often improve boiling performance and change the boiling crisis behavior. Conventional wisdom in this field attributes that these changes in boiling behavior are tied to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the particular surfactant. However, our work reveals that these changes in boiling behavior are independent of the CMC for three nonionic surfactants across a wide range of molar concentrations. In addition, visual snapshots of the bubbling behavior indicate changes in bubble formation, such as bubble size and nucleation site density, influenced by the molar concentration-dependent diffusion timescale of surfactants. Hence, these findings offer compelling evidence that boiling behavior, encompassing both boiling performance and boiling crisis, is governed by the dynamic adsorption of surfactants rather than dictated by the CMC. This becomes evident when quantifying the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) using the logarithm of molar concentration, as predicted by theory. Building upon these findings, we propose insights for controlling when CHF modification occurs in specific scenarios involving any surfactants. These insights hold significant potential for optimizing heat transfer processes and leveraging surfactants in energy-related applications to maximize boiling efficiency.</description>

      <title>A viscous drop in a planar linear flow -- the role of deformation on streamline topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar linear flows are a one-parameter family, with the parameter $\hat{\alpha}\in [-1,1]$ being a measure of the relative magnitudes of extension and vorticity; $\hat{\alpha} = -1$, $0$ and $1$ correspond to solid-body rotation, simple shear flow and planar extension, respectively. For a neutrally buoyant spherical drop in a hyperbolic planar linear flow with $\hat{\alpha}\in(0,1]$, the near-field streamlines are closed for $0 \leq \hat{\alpha} &lt; 1$ and for $\lambda &gt; \lambda_c = 2 \hat{\alpha} / (1 - \hat{\alpha})$, $\lambda$ being the drop-to-medium viscosity ratio; all streamlines are closed for an ambient elliptic linear flow with $\hat{\alpha}\in[-1,0)$. We use both analytical and numerical tools to show that drop deformation, as characterized by a non-zero capillary number ($Ca$), destroys the aforementioned closed-streamline topology. While inertia has previously been shown to transform closed Stokesian streamlines into open spiraling ones that run from upstream to downstream infinity, the streamline topology around a deformed drop, for small but finite $Ca$, is more complicated. Only a subset of the original closed streamlines transforms to open spiraling ones, while the remaining ones densely wind around a configuration of nested invariant tori. Our results contradict previous efforts pointing to the persistence of the closed streamline topology exterior to a deformed drop and have important implications for transport and mixing.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient queue-based algorithm for simulating volume-controlled drainage under the influence of gravity on volumetric images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating non-wetting fluid invasion in volumetric images of porous materials is of broad interest in applications as diverse as electrochemical devices and CO2 sequestration. Among available methods, image-based algorithms offer much lower computational cost compared to direct numerical simulations. Recent work has extended image-based method to incorporate more physics such as gravity and volume-controlled invasion. The present work combines these two developments to develop an image-based invasion percolation algorithm that incorporates the effect of gravity. Additionally, the presented algorithm was developed using a priority queue algorithm to drastically reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The priority queue-based method was validated against previous image-based methods both with and without the effect of gravity, showing identical results. It was also shown that the new method provides a speedup of 20X over the previous image-based methods. Finally, comparison with experimental results at three Bond numbers showed that the model can predict the real invasion process with a high accuracy with and without gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Heavy Particle Clustering in Inertial Subrange of High--Reynolds Number Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence shows pronounced clustering of inertial particles in the inertial subrange at high Reynolds number, in addition to the clustering typically observed in the near dissipation range. The clustering in the inertial subrange is characterized by the bump in the particle number density spectra and is due to modulation of preferential concentration. The number density spectrum can be modeled by a rational function of the scale-dependent Stokes number.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic permeability of heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing a sound appraisal of the nature of the relationship between flow $(Q)$ and pressure drop $(\Delta P)$ for porous media is a long-standing fundamental research challenge. A wide variety of environmental, societal and industrial issues, ranging, e.g., from water-soil system remediation to subsurface energy optimization, is affected by this critical issue. While such dependence is well represented by the Kozeny-Carman formulation for homogeneous media, the fundamental nature of such a relationship ($Q$ vs $\Delta P$) within heterogeneous porous systems characterized by a broad range of pore sizes is still not fully understood. We design a set of controlled and complex porous structures and quantify their intrinsic permeability through detailed high quality microfluidics experiments. We synthesize the results upon deriving an original analytical formulation relating the overall intrinsic permeability of the porous structure and their key features. Our formulation explicitly embeds the spatial variability of pore sizes into the medium permeability through a conceptualization of the system as a collection of smaller scale porous media arranged in series. The resulting analytical formulation yields permeability values matching their experimentally-based counterparts without the need of additional tunable parameters. Our study then documents and supports the strong role played by the micro-structure on the overall medium permeability.</description>

Abstract: The innovative bladeless design of the AirMultiplier, patented by Dyson in 2009, has generated significant interest due to its unique approach to air circulation that leverages the Coanda effect. In this study, we present a comprehensive parametric analysis of a simplified bladeless fan geometry, with a specific focus on the discharge ratio and generated thrust force for small to medium radii (5 to 200mm) and a range of flow rates spanning from 1 to 100g/s. In addition to the radii and mass flow rates, this study also addresses the effect of the slit nozzle thickness on the discharge ratio and thrust force of the AirMultiplier. By exploring the influence of this additional parameter, we aim to provide a more complete understanding of the performance characteristics of the geometry and to offer insights that could inform the design and optimization of similar bladeless geometries.</description>

      <title>EngineBench: Flow Reconstruction in the Transparent Combustion Chamber III Optical Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present EngineBench, the first machine learning (ML) oriented database to use high quality experimental data for the study of turbulent flows inside combustion machinery. Prior datasets for ML in fluid mechanics are synthetic or use overly simplistic geometries. EngineBench is comprised of real-world particle image velocimetry (PIV) data that captures the turbulent airflow patterns in a specially-designed optical engine. However, in PIV data from internal flows, such as from engines, it is often challenging to achieve a full field of view and large occlusions can be present. In order to design optimal combustion systems, insight into the turbulent flows in these obscured areas is needed, which can be provided via inpainting models. Here we propose a novel inpainting task using random edge gaps, a technique that emphasises realism by introducing occlusions at random sizes and orientations at the edges of the PIV images. We test five ML methods on random edge gaps using pixel-wise, vector-based, and multi-scale performance metrics. We find that UNet-based models are more accurate than the industry-norm non-parametric approach and the context encoder at this task on both small and large gap sizes. The dataset and inpainting task presented in this paper support the development of more general-purpose pre-trained ML models for engine design problems. The method comparisons allow for more informed selection of ML models for problems in experimental flow diagnostics. All data and code are publicly available at https://eng.ox.ac.uk/tpsrg/research/enginebench/.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian filtering for wave-mean flow decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geophysical flows are typically composed of wave and mean motions with a wide range of overlapping temporal scales, making separation between the two types of motion in wave-resolving numerical simulations challenging. Lagrangian filtering - whereby a temporal filter is applied in the frame of the flow - is an effective way to overcome this challenge, allowing clean separation of waves from mean flow based on frequency separation in a Lagrangian frame. Previous implementations of Lagrangian filtering have used particle tracking approaches, which are subject to large memory requirements or difficulties with particle clustering. Kafiabad and Vanneste (2023, KV23) recently proposed a novel method for finding Lagrangian means without particle tracking by solving a set of partial differential equations alongside the governing equations of the flow. In this work, we adapt the approach of KV23 to develop a flexible, on-the-fly, PDE-based method for Lagrangian filtering using arbitrary convolutional filters. We present several different wave-mean decompositions, demonstrating that our Lagrangian methods are capable of recovering a clean wave-field from a nonlinear simulation of geostrophic turbulence interacting with Poincar\'e waves.</description>

      <title>Cascades of turbulent kinetic energy and multicomponent scalars in a momentum-scalar coupling turbulence driven by multiscale forces under homogeneous and isotropic hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Momentum-scalar coupling turbulence, a phenomenon observed in both natural and engineering contexts, involves the intricate interaction between multicomponent scalars and multiscale forces (i.e. multiple coupling mechanisms), resulting in a wide array of manifestations. Despite its importance, limited research has been conducted to comprehend the influence of these multicomponent and multiple coupling mechanisms on turbulence cascades. Hence, this study aims to provide a preliminary and theoretical exploration into how these multiple coupling mechanisms govern the cascades of turbulent kinetic energy and multicomponent scalars. The key findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Validation of Quad-cascade processes. (2) Examination of various cases involving single scalar components but multiple coupling mechanisms. Of particular interest is the coexistence of buoyancy-driven turbulence and electrokinetic turbulence, which introduces a new VF subrange resulting from their nonlinear interaction. Another extension considers an exponential modulation function, equivalent to the coexistence of multiple coupling mechanisms acting on a single scalar. The study identifies two new VF subranges. (3) Binary scalar components and coupling mechanisms are investigated, indicating coupling mechanisms with significantly different strengths can also induce complex interactions and new VF subranges. This highlights the challenges inherent in addressing the simultaneous presence of multiple scalar components and coupling mechanisms. This research endeavor illuminates the theoretical understanding of the diverse scaling properties observed in momentum-scalar coupling turbulence across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dual residence time for droplet to coalesce with liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When droplets approach a liquid surface, they have a tendency to merge in order to minimize surface energy. However, under certain conditions, they can exhibit a phenomenon called coalescence delay, where they remain separate for tens of milliseconds. This duration is known as the residence time or the non-coalescence time. Surprisingly, under identical parameters and initial conditions, the residence time for water droplets is not a constant value but exhibits dual peaks in its distribution. In this paper, we present the observation of the dual residence times through rigorous statistical analysis and investigate the quantitative variations in residence time by manipulating parameters such as droplet height, radius, and viscosity. Theoretical models and physical arguments are provided to explain their effects, particularly why a large viscosity or/and a small radius is detrimental to the appearance of the longer residence time peak.</description>

Abstract: The unavailability of accurate boundary treatment methods for compressible Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) severely limits its ability to simulate flows in and around bodies. To this end, challenges specific to compressible flows with SPH are carefully considered. Based on these, robust and widely applicable boundary treatment methods for compressible SPH are proposed. These are accompanied by a novel technique to prevent particle penetration at boundaries. The proposed methods are shown to be significantly better than other recent approaches. A wide variety of test problems, many of which are not shown to be simulated with SPH thus far, are employed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. The implementation is open source and the results are automated in the interest of reproducibility. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of SPH as a viable alternative to mesh-based methods for compressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>DeepLag: Discovering Deep Lagrangian Dynamics for Intuitive Fluid Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as meteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually observed from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for fluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.</description>

      <title>Reliable chaotic transition in incompressible fluid simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder that exhibits chaotic behavior, to examine the behavior of various numerical methods. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior. The key requirements identified are pressure-robustness of the method, high resolution, and appropriate numerical dissipation when the smallest scales are under-resolved.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Hybrid-Spectral Incompressible Navier-Stokes Model For Nonlinear Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new high-order accurate computational fluid dynamics model based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free surface for the accurate simulation of nonlinear and dispersive water waves in the time domain. The spatial discretization is based on Chebyshev polynomials in the vertical direction and a Fourier basis in the horizontal direction, allowing for the use of the fast Chebyshev and Fourier transforms for the efficient computation of spatial derivatives. The temporal discretization is done through a generalized low-storage explicit 4th order Runge-Kutta, and for the scheme to conserve mass and achieve high-order accuracy, a velocity-pressure coupling needs to be satisfied at all Runge-Kutta stages. This result in the emergence of a Poisson pressure problem that constitute a geometric conservation law for mass conservation. The occurring Poisson problem is proposed to be solved efficiently via an accelerated iterative solver based on a geometric $p$-multigrid scheme, which takes advantage of the high-order polynomial basis in the spatial discretization and hence distinguishes itself from conventional low-order numerical schemes. We present numerical experiments for validation of the scheme in the context of numerical wave tanks demonstrating that the $p$-multigrid accelerated numerical scheme can effectively solve the Poisson problem that constitute the computational bottleneck, that the model can achieve the desired spectral convergence, and is capable of simulating wave-propagation over non-flat bottoms with excellent agreement in comparison to experimental results.</description>
