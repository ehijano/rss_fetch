      <description>arXiv:2502.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recently discovered multiple superconducting states in rhombohedral graphene quarter metal. We demonstrate that one of these states features a single-spin, single-valley, single-band, single-Fermi-pocket parent state and is most likely a chiral topological pair-density wave, marked by a threefold symmetry that may not be spontaneously broken, unpaired Majorana zero modes at edges, vortices, and dislocations, and an anomalous intrinsic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Shining light on collective modes in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that collective excitations and optical responses of moir\'e fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) drastically differ from those of standard fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a Landau level. By constructing a variational wavefunction that incorporates the moir\'e lattice effect, we capture the collective modes in FCIs across a range of crystal momenta including the roton minimum. Interestingly, new collective modes -- ``fractional excitons'' -- are found in the long wavelength limit ($\boldsymbol{q} \rightarrow 0$) at low energy below the excitation continuum, distinct from the FQH case. Some of these modes are optically active and manifest as sharp peaks in optical conductivity at THz frequency. We further show that intraband optical absorption and spectral weight in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$ are highly tunable by the displacement field. Our work thus establishes optical spectroscopy as a powerful tool to illuminate the unique collective modes of moir\'e FCIs.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetoroton bands in moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent realizations of the Hofstadter butterfly and fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials have introduced a new ingredient, a periodic lattice potential, to the study of quantum Hall phases. While the fractionalized states in moir\'e systems are expected to be in the same universality class as their counterparts in Landau levels, the periodic potential can have qualitative and quantitative effects on physical observables. Here, we examine how the magnetoroton collective modes of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are altered by external periodic potentials. Employing a single-mode-approximation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the low-energy neutral excitations expressed in terms of three-point density correlation functions, which are computed using Monte Carlo. Our analysis is applicable to FQH states in graphene with a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate and also to fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We predict experimentally testable trends in the THz absorption characteristics of FCI and FQH states and estimate the external potential strength at which a soft-mode phase transition occurs between FQH and charge density wave (CDW) states.</description>

      <title>Developing fractional quantum Hall states at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extreme quantum limit, when the Landau level filling factor $\nu&lt;1$, the dominant electron-electron interaction in low-disorder two-dimensional electron systems leads to exotic many-body phases. The ground states at even-denominator $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4 are typically Fermi seas of composite fermions carrying two and four flux quanta, surrounded by the Jain fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at odd-denominator fillings $\nu=p/(2p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(4p\pm1)$, where $p$ is an integer. For $\nu&lt;$ 1/5, an insulating behavior, which is generally believed to signal the formation of a pinned Wigner crystal, is seen. Our experiments on ultrahigh-quality, dilute, GaAs two-dimensional electron systems reveal developing FQHSs at $\nu=p/(6p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(8p\pm1)$, manifested by magnetoresistance minima superimposed on the insulating background. In stark contrast to $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4, however, we observe a pronounced, sharp minimum in magnetoresistance at $\nu=$ 1/6 and a somewhat weaker minimum at $\nu=$ 1/8, suggesting developing FQHSs, likely stabilized by the pairing of composite fermions that carry six and eight flux quanta. Our results signal the unexpected entry, in ultrahigh-quality samples, of FQHSs at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8, which are likely to harbor non-Abelian anyon excitations.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation and transport behaviors in altermagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) spin-relaxation mechanism has traditionally been associated with either relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which breaks space-inversion symmetry, or inhomogeneous magnetization, which breaks both time-reversal and translational symmetries. Here, we investigate spin relaxation mechanism in altermagnetic systems which possess novel magnetic states characterized by sublattices connected through crystal-rotation symmetries and opposite spins with zero overall net magnetization and absence of spin-orbit coupling. We find that altermagnetic states exhibit DP-type spin relaxations in both strong- and weak-scattering regimes, with the spin relaxation rate decreasing to zero as the temperature approaches the critical temperature of the altermagnetic phase transition. However, the scattering time involved in this spin relaxation mechanism is not the momentum relaxation time, in contrast to the conventional DP spin relaxation. Using a kinetic approach incorporating rigorous microscopic scattering, we demonstrate that the spin Hall current is highly anisotropic and proportional to the degree of altermagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Hole Spin in Direct Bandgap Germanium-Tin Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium (Ge) has emerged as a contender for scalable solid-state spin qubits. This interest stems from the numerous attractive properties of hole spin in Ge low-dimensional systems and their compatibility with the standards of silicon processing. Herein, we show that the controlled incorporation of Sn into the Ge lattice enables hole spin quantum dots that retain the same advantages as those made of Ge while also providing bandgap directness. The latter is essential for a more efficient interaction with light, a key feature in the implementation of photon-spin interfaces and quantum memories. We first map the material properties for a range of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ planar heterostructures to identify the optimal conditions to simultaneously achieve hole spin confinement and bandgap directness. Although compressive strain is necessary for heavy hole confinement, we estimate that an additional 4.5 at.% of Sn is needed for every 1% increase in the absolute value of compressive strain to preserve the direct bandgap. However, a high compressive strain is found to be detrimental to the Rashba coupling. Moreover, a theoretical framework is derived to evaluate the dipole moment $d$ and the relaxation rate $\Gamma$ of electric dipole spin resonance quantum dot devices. We compare the perturbative and effective values of $d$ with the values obtained from the full 3D Hamiltonian. We find $d$ to be around 1 and 0.01 e pm for the out-of-plane and in-plane configurations, respectively, and $\Gamma\propto B^5$, eventually becoming $\propto B^7$ in the out-of-plane configuration.</description>

      <title>Controlling spin currents with magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling spin current lies at the heart of spintronics and its applications. The sign of spin currents is monotonous in ferromagnets once the current direction is determined. Spin currents in antiferromagnets can possess opposite polarization, but requires enormous magnetic fields to lift the degeneracy. Controlling spin currents with different polarization is urgently demanded but remains hitherto elusive. Here, we demonstrate the control of spin currents at room temperature by magnon interference in a canted antiferromagnet, hematite recently also classified as an altermagnet. Magneto-optical characterization by Brillouin light scattering revealed that the spatial periodicity of the beating patterns was tunable via the microwave frequency. The inverse spin-Hall voltage changed sign as the frequency was scanned, i.e., a frequency-controlled switching of polarization in pure spin currents was obtained. Our work marks the use of antiferromagnetic magnon interference to control spin currents, which substantially extends the horizon for the emerging field of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Symplectic-Amoeba formulation of the non-Bloch band theory for one-dimensional two-band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is a topological phenomenon, resulting in the condensation of bulk modes near the boundaries. Due to the localization of bulk modes at the edges, boundary effects remain significant even in the thermodynamic limit. This makes conventional Bloch band theory inapplicable and hinders the accurate computation of the spectrum. The Amoeba formulation addresses this problem by determining the potential from which the spectrum can be derived using the generalized Szeg\"o's limit theorem, reducing the problem to an optimization of the Ronkin function. While this theory provides novel insights into non-Hermitian physics, challenges arise from the multiband nature and symmetry-protected degeneracies, even in one-dimensional cases. In this work, we investigate one-dimensional two-band class AII$^\dagger$ systems, where Kramers pairs invalidate the conventional Amoeba formalism. We find that these challenges can be overcome by optimizing the band-resolved Ronkin functions, which is achieved by extrapolating the total Ronkin function. Finally, we propose a generalized Szeg\"o's limit theorem for class AII$^\dagger$ and numerically demonstrate that our approach correctly computes the potential and localization length.</description>

      <title>Multimode operation of a superconducting nanowire switch in the nanosecond regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are promising candidates for future computational architectures, however, practical applications require fast operation. Here, we demonstrate fast, gate-based switching of an Al nanowire-based superconducting switch in time-domain experiments. We apply voltage pulses on the gate while monitoring the microwave transmission of the device. Utilizing the usual leakage-based operation these measurements yield a fast, 1--2~ns switching time to the normal state, possibly limited by the bandwidth of our setup, and a 10--20~ns delay in the normal to superconducting transition. However, having a significant capacitance between the gate and the device allows for a novel operation, where the displacement current, induced by the fast gate pulses, drives the transition. The switching from superconducting to the normal state yields a similar fast timescale, while in the opposite direction the switching is significantly faster (4--6~ns) than the leakage based operation, which may be further improved by better thermal design. The measured short timescales and novel switching operation open the way for future fast and low-power-consumption applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Current Injection into a 1D Ballistic Edge Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized charge transport through a 1D ballistic channel was famously explained decades ago by Rolf Landauer, by considering local injection of charge carriers from two contacts at the ends of the 1D channel. With the rise of quantum (spin/anomalous) Hall insulators, i.e., 2D material systems with ballistic 1D edge states along their perimeter, a different geometry has become relevant: The distributed injection of charge carriers from a 2D half-plane with residual conductivity into the 1D edge channel. Here, we generalize Landauer's treatment of ballistic transport to such a setup and identify hallmark signatures that distinguish a ballistic channel from a resistive one.</description>

      <title>Surface acoustic wave driven acoustic spin splitter in d-wave altermagnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of spin currents is a key challenge in the field of spintronics. We propose using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to generate spin currents in altermagnetic thin films, thereby realizing an acoustic spin splitter. Altermagnets, characterized by spin-polarized electrons and magnons, provide a versatile platform where SAWs can drive spin currents carried by both charge carriers and magnons. This acoustic spin splitter can be implemented in both metallic and insulating altermagnetic thin films, offering broad material applicability and a novel way to detect the spin splitter effect in insulating altermagnetic thin film. We examine a realistic experimental setup where a heavy metal layer, such as platinum, is used to convert the spin current into a measurable charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect. For representative material parameters, we calculate the expected spin current and the corresponding inverse spin Hall voltage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tuning the SAW frequency allows for precise control over the spin current, highlighting the versatility and potential of the acoustic spin splitter for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Exact Solution for Driven Landau Levels in Two-dimensional Electron Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum systems with time-dependent fields opens avenues for engineering novel states of matter and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. Landau levels in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), with their discrete energy spectrum and characteristic cyclotron dynamics, provide an important platform for realizing and studying such driven quantum systems. While exact solutions for driven Landau levels exist, they have been limited to specific gauges or representations. In this work, we present an algebraic, gauge- and representation-independent exact solution for driven Landau levels in 2DEGs subject to arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our approach, based on a time-dependent unitary transformation via the displacement operator, provides clear physical insights into the driven quantum dynamics. We apply this method to derive the exact Floquet states and quasienergies for periodically driven Landau levels, and we extend our analysis to the resonant driving regime, where the Floquet picture breaks down and the electron wavefunction exhibits unbounded spatial spreading. Furthermore, we calculate the instantaneous energy absorption rate, revealing distinct absorption behaviors between coherent states and Fock or thermal states, stemming from quantum interference effects.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and nontrivial topology can give rise to a wealth of exotic quantum states. A notable example is the formation of Wigner crystals driven by strong electron-electron interactions. When these electronic crystals emerge in a parent band carrying a large Berry curvature, they can exhibit topologically nontrivial properties as anomalous Hall crystals, spontaneously breaking both continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the experimental observation of tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moir\'e superlattices. At filling factors near one electron per moir\'e unit cell (v=1), we identify a series of incommensurate Chern insulators with a Chern number of C=1. Furthermore, we observe spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking spanning the entire filling range from v=1 to v=2, manifesting as anomalous Hall effects with pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Notably, anomalous Hall crystals with a high Chern number C=3 are observed over generic fillings ranging from v=1.5 to v=2. These anomalous Hall crystals are incommensurate with the moir\'e superlattice and exhibit dispersive fan diagrams consistent with the Streda formula, with their positions continuously tunable through displacement fields. Remarkably, these partially filled Chern insulators display Chern numbers distinct from their parent bands. Our findings demonstrate the rich variety of electronic crystalline states in rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices, offering valuable insights into the strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Optics of Anisotropic Exciton Polaritons in Two-Dimensional Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered 2D organic-inorganic perovskite semiconductors support strongly confined excitons that offer significant potential for ultrathin polaritonic devices due to their tunability and huge oscillator strength. The application of a magnetic field has proven to be an invaluable tool for investigating the exciton fine structure observed in these materials. Yet, the combination of an in-plane magnetic field and the strong coupling regime has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we combine microscopic theory with a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations to model the magneto-optics of exciton polaritons in 2D perovskites. We predict that the brightened dark exciton state can enter the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, the magnetic-field-induced mixing of polarization selection rules and the breaking of in-plane symmetry lead to highly anisotropic polariton branches. This study contributes to a better understanding of the exciton fine structure in 2D perovskites and demonstrates the cavity control of highly anisotropic and polarization-sensitive exciton polaritons.</description>

      <title>Diverse dynamics in interacting vortices systems through tunable conservative and non-conservative coupling strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic vortices are highly tunable, nonlinear systems with ideal properties for being applied in spin wave emission, data storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, their technological application is impaired by a limited understanding of non conservative forces, that results in the open challenge of attaining precise control over vortex dynamics in coupled vortex systems. Here, we present an analytical model for the gyrotropic dynamics of coupled magnetic vortices within nano pillar structures, revealing how conservative and non conservative forces dictate their complex behavior. Validated by micromagnetic simulations, our model accurately predicts dynamic states, controllable through external current and magnetic field adjustments. The experimental verification in a fabricated nano pillar device aligns with our predictions, and it showcases the system's adaptability in dynamical coupling. The unique dynamical states, combined with the system's tunability and inherent memory, make it an exemplary foundation for reservoir computing. This positions our discovery at the forefront of utilizing magnetic vortex dynamics for innovative computing solutions, marking a leap towards efficient data processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven Intrinsic Nonlinear Pure Spin Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of pure spin current, spin angular momentum transport without charge flow, is crucial for developing energy-efficient spintronic devices with minimal Joule heating. Here, we introduce the intrinsic nonlinear pure spin Hall effect (NPSHE), where both linear and second-order charge Hall currents vanish. We show intrinsic second-order spin angular momentum transport in metals and insulators through a detailed analysis of the quantum geometric origin of different spin current contributions. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies 39 magnetic point groups that support NPSHE, providing a foundation for material design and experimental realization. We predict significant nonlinear pure spin Hall currents in Kramers-Weyl metals even at room temperature, positioning them as potential candidates for NPSHE-based spin-torque devices. Our work lays a practical pathway for realizing charge-free angular momentum transport for the development of next-generation, energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. I will argue here that the survival of this phase in a crystal implies a complex amplitude for transverse phonons. This modifies three-phonon interference patterns, twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{max}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. Combined with the interatomic distance, $a$ and the magnetic length, $\ell_B$, it yields: $\Theta_H \approx \lambda_{max}^2u_m^2a^{-2}\ell_B^{-2}$. This is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Magnonic Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a magnetically ordered system are spin waves with magnon being their excitation quanta. Magnons are demonstrated to be useful for data processing and communication. To achieve magnon transport across extended distances, it is essential to minimize magnonic dissipation which can be accomplished by material engineering to reduce intrinsic damping or by spin torques that can counteract damping. This study introduces an alternative methodology to effectively reduce magnon dissipation based on magnonic bound states in the continuum (BIC). We demonstrate the approach for two antiferromagnetically coupled magnonic waveguides, with one waveguide being attached to a current carrying metallic layer. The current acts on the attached waveguide with a spin-orbit torque effectively amplifying the magnonic signal. The setup maps on a non-Hermitian system with coupled loss and more loss, enabling the formation of dissipationless magnon BIC. We investigate the necessary criteria for the formation of magnon BIC through electric currents. The influences of interlayer coupling constant, anisotropy constants and applied magnetic field on the current-induced magnon BIC are analyzed. The identified effect can be integrated in the design of magnon delay lines, offering opportunities for the enhancement of magnonic devices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of Non-Hermitian Topological Interface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the hybridization of radiating topological interface states, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi states but in gain media with radiation fields. This hybridization not only modifies energy levels under a strong coupling scheme but also significantly reshapes far-field radiation characteristics. The bonding mode exhibits sub-radiant, omnidirectional emission, while the antibonding mode becomes super-radiant and highly unidirectional. Crucially, this non-Hermitian hybridization is tunable, allowing simultaneous control of energy splitting, quality factor, and far-field radiation by varying the distance between the two topological interfaces. Our findings establish hybridized radiating topological interface states as a robust platform for engineering two-level systems with tailored far-field responses, offering new possibilities for applications in beam shaping, nonlinear optics, quantum technologies, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale is foundational to nanophotonics, with epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials demonstrating significant potential.High-quality (Q) factor resonances maximizing these interactions are typically realized in photonic crystals requiring sub-50 nm precision nanofabrication over large areas, limiting scalability and increasing complexity. Mie resonances offer an alternative but are constrained by low Q factors due to the scarcity of high refractive index materials, necessitating large refractive index changes for effective resonance switching and limiting dynamic reconfigurability. We overcome these limitations by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability. We introduce three resonator-ENZ configurations - voids in AlN, Ge in $SiO_2$, and intrinsic InSb in doped InSb - spanning from low-loss phononic to lossy plasmonic ENZ modes.Using novel epitaxial regrowth techniques, we achieve significant Q-factor improvements over non-embedded resonators. Notably, an air-based Mie resonator embedded in AlN supports resonant Q-factors exceeding 100, with negligible geometric dispersion across sizes from 800 nm to 2,800 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate dynamic reconfigurability of intrinsic InSb resonators by thermally tuning the ENZ wavelength over a 2$\mu$m range in the mid-infrared (11-16 $\mu$m) wavelength regime. These results showcase the potential of Mie resonators embedded in ENZ media for high-fidelity sensors, thermal emitters, and reconfigurable metasurfaces, bridging theoretical predictions with practical applications, advancing the development of dynamic, high-Q optical devices.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as vdWE and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their exceptional capability to continuously produce high-quality free-standing films. The successful implementation of these emerging epitaxial techniques crucially hinges on creating a robust uniform 2D material surface at the wafer-scale and with atomically precise uniformity. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on a SiC wafer is through high-temperature graphitization, which produces epitaxial graphene on the surface of the SiC wafer. However, the extremely high temperature needed for silicon sublimation (&gt; 1500 C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface in addition to the growth of uneven graphene at the edges of the step, leading to multilayer graphene stripes and unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we fully develop a graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures (growth time of less than 1 min and growth temperature of less than 500 C) at wafer-scale by metal-assisted graphitization. We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, which produces single-crystalline graphene while maintaining atomically smooth surface morphology. The thickness of the graphene layer can be precisely controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature. We successfully produce freestanding single-crystalline ultra-wide bandgap (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG represents a promising route for the commercialization of the 2D-based epitaxy technique, enabling the production of large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with extraordinary electrical properties, hold promising for large-scale, flexible electronics. However, their device performance could be hindered due to the excessive defects introduced via traditional electrode integration processes. Transfer printing techniques have been developed for van der Waals contacts integration, while existing techniques encounter limitations in achieving conformal electrode transfer and compatibility with flexible devices. Here we introduce a highly conformal microprinting technique utilizing polypropylene carbonate (PPC)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) copolymer, which enables successful transfer of wafer-scale, micropatterned electrodes onto diverse substrates, including those with complex geometries. This technique, implemented with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), yields 2D field-effect transistors with near-ideal ohmic contacts, and a record-high carrier mobility up to 334 cm2 V-1 s-1 for a WSe2 device. Furthermore, we fabricated transistor arrays on MoS2 thin film, which show uniform device performance. We also present the flexible MoS2 transistors that not only achieve a high electron mobility of up to 111 cm2 V-1 s-1 but also exhibit outstanding mechanical robustness. Our findings represent a significant leap forward in the fabrication of flexible 2D electronics, paving the way for numerous emerging technologies.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a newly identified form of unconventional antiferromagnetism, enables the removal of spin degeneracy in the absence of net magnetization that provides a platform for the low power consumption and ultra-fast device applications. However, the rare attention has been paid to the relationship between stacking, strain and altermagnet, multipiezo effect and topological state. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize the altermagnet, multipiezo effect, and topological state in two-dimensional materials by the stacking and strain engineering. Based on the analysis of symmetry, we find that the spin splitting feature related to the Ut, PTt, MzUt, or MzPTt symmetries in altermagnet multilayers. In addition, we find that the stacking engineering can effectively realize the transform from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism and semiconductor to metal for the Jauns bilayer V2SeTeO. More interestingly, the strain not only induces an intriguing multipiezo effect, encompassing the piezovalley, piezomagnetism and piezoelectric, but also achieves the abundant topological phase. Our findings offer a generalized direction for manipulating the spin splitting, valley polarization, and topological states, promoting practical application of valleytronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Multifield Induced Antiferromagnet Transformation into Altermagnet and Realized Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new category of collinear magnetism distinct from traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, exhibits the spin splitting without net magnetization. Currently, researchers are focus on searching three-dimensional altermagnetism and exploring its novel physical properties. However, there is a lack of understanding of the physical origin of two-dimensional altermagnetic emergent behavior. Here, we propose an approach to realize the transition from Neel antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism in two-dimensional system using an electric field, Janus structure, and ferroelectric substrate. In monolayer VPSe3, we demonstrate that multiple-physical-fields cause the upper and lower Se atoms unequal to break PT symmetry, resulting in altermagnetic spin splitting. Noted that monolayer VPSe3 produces a spontaneous valley splitting of 2.91 meV at the conduction band minimum. The electric field can effectively tune the valley splitting magnitude, while the Janus structure not only changes the valley splitting magnitude, but also alters the direction. More interestingly, when the ferroelectric polarization of Al2S3 is upward, the direction of valley polarization is switched and the magnitude is almost unchanged. However, the valley splitting sigfinicantly increases under the downward. It is worth noting that the ferroelectric polarization can switch altermagnetic effect and realize anomalous valley Hall effect. Besides, we reveal the microscopic mechanism of valley splitting by an effective Hamiltonian. Our findings not only provide a method to designing altermagnet, but also enriches the valley physics.</description>

Abstract: Magnetodielectric (MD) materials are important for their ability to spin-charge conversion, magnetic field control of electric polarization and vice versa. Among these, two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are of particular interest due to the presence of magnetic anisotropy (MA) originating from the interaction between the magnetic moments and the crystal field. Also, these materials indicate a high degree of stability in the long-range spin order and may be described using suitable spin Hamiltonians of the Heisenberg, XY, or Ising type. Recent reports have suggested effective interactions between magnetization and electric polarization in 2D magnets. However, MD coupling studies on layered magnetic materials are still few. This review covers the fundamentals of magnetodielectric coupling by explaining related key terms. It includes the necessary conditions for having this coupling and sheds light on the possible physical mechanisms behind this coupling starting from phenomenological descriptions. Apart from that, this review classifies 2D magnetic materials into several categories for reaching out each and every class of materials. Additionally, this review summarizes recent advancements of some pioneer 2D magnetodielectric materials. Last but not the least, the current review provides possible research directions for enhancing magnetodielectric coupling in those and mentions the possibilities for future developments.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Triferroic and Multiple Types of Valley Polarization by Structural Phase Transition in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiferroic materials, which coexist magnetism, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley, have broad practical application prospects in promoting the miniaturization and integration of spintronic and valleytronic devices. However, it is rare that there are triferroic orders and multiple types of valley polarization in a real material. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize triferroic order coexistence and multiple types of valley polarization by structural phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The 1T and 2H phase OsBr2 monolayers exhibit non-magnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic semiconductor with valley polarization up to 175.49 meV, respectively. Interestingly, the 1T phase OsBr2 bilayer shows the tri-state valley polarization due to lattice symmetry breaking, while the valley polarization of 2H phase bilayer originates from the combined effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the valley polarization and ferroelectric polarization of 1T phase AB stackings and 2H phase AA stackings can be manipulated via interlayer sliding. Importantly, we have verified that the 2H phase can be transformed to 1T phase by Li+ ion intercalation, while the 2H phase can occur the structural phase transition into the 1T phase by infrared laser induction. Our work provides a feasible strategy for manipulating valley polarization and a design idea for nano-devices with nonvolatile multiferroic properties.</description>

      <title>Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magneto-ionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Deployable Nanoelectromechanical Bound States in the Continuum Enabled by GHz Lamb Wave Phononic Crystals on LiNbO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a fascinating class of eigenstates that trap energy within the continuum, enabling breakthroughs in ultra-low-threshold lasing, high-Q sensing, and advanced wave-matter interactions. However, their stringent symmetry requirements hinder practical integration, especially in acoustic and electromechanical systems where efficient mode excitation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate deployable nanoelectromechanical quasi-BICs on suspended lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films, enabled by nanoscale Lamb wave phononic crystals (PnCs) operating at gigahertz frequencies. By exploiting the decoupling of symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) Lamb wave modes, we create a robust framework for BICs. Controlled mirror symmetry breaking induces targeted coupling between the S and A modes, resulting in quasi-BICs that preserve high-Q characteristics and can be excited by traveling waves, eliminating the need for specialized excitation schemes. Our approach enables the multiplexing of quasi-BIC resonators along a single transmission line, each corresponding to a unique frequency and spatial position. This work presents a scalable route for the on-chip integration of BICs, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical nanoelectromechanical devices, and opening new avenues in advanced signal processing, high-precision sensing, and quantum acoustics.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $\nu{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</description>

      <title>Monolithic On-Chip Phononic Chiral Anomalous Bulk States on LiNbO3 Thin-films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phononic materials are crucial for developing efficient, robust mechanical waveguides with strong transport properties, enabling advances in sensing, signal processing, energy harvesting, and microfluidics. A key motivation is their integration into monolithic systems for on-chip applications. While topological phononic materials developed in the past decade offer unidirectional edge states immune to backscattering, their integration requires large volumes to control localized small volumes' transport properties, limiting their efficiency and application in modern phononic circuits. The recently introduced chiral anomalous bulk states (CABSs) combine the advantages of topological materials with innovative boundary designs, overcoming transmission limitations and ensuring full material utilization for superior wave propagation. Here, we present the first on-chip monolithic CABS device integrated on a suspended LiNbO3 thin film. This breakthrough enables the creation of phononic waveguides with unmatched unidirectionality, low loss, and high transmission efficiency, seamlessly integrated with broadband piezoelectric transducers, and showcasing their potential for high-fidelity, broad-bandwidth microwave signal transmission. Additionally, we exploit the slow-wave characteristics of CABSs for delay lines and high-density signal processing. Tailoring wave propagation through boundary engineering opens a new paradigm for phononic/photonic device design, with implications across microelectronics, high-frequency communications, radar, and advanced sensing technologies. The work sets the stage for the future development of highly scalable, multifunctional, and robust phononic systems, unlocking new avenues for integrated acoustic technologies.</description>

      <title>Mastering the growth of antimonene on Bi2Se3: strategies and insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimonene, the two-dimensional phase of antimony, appears in two distinct allotropes when epitaxially grown on Bi2Se3: the puckered asymmetric washboard ({\alpha}) and buckled honeycomb ({\beta}) bilayer structures. As-deposited antimony films exhibit varying proportions of single {\alpha} and {\beta} structures. We identify the conditions necessary for ordered, pure-phase growth of single to triple {\beta}-antimonene bilayers. Additionally, we determine their electronic structure, work function, and characteristic core-level binding energies, offering an explanation for the relatively large chemical shifts observed among the different phases. This study not only establishes a protocol for achieving a single {\beta} phase of antimonene but also provides key signatures for distinguishing between the different allotropes using standard spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, garnering decades of investment in high quality materials and devices. Electron spin systems in semiconductors, including atomic defects and quantum dots, have been demonstrated in the last two decades to host quantum coherent spin qubits, often with coherent spin-photon interfaces and proximal nuclear spins. These systems are at the center of developing quantum technology. However, new material challenges arise when considering the isotopic composition of host and qubit systems. The isotopic composition governs the nature and concentration of nuclear spins, which naturally occur in leading host materials. These spins generate magnetic noise -- detrimental to qubit coherence -- but also show promise as local quantum memories and processors, necessitating careful engineering dependent on the targeted application. Reviewing recent experimental and theoretical progress towards understanding local nuclear spin environments in semiconductors, we show this aspect of material engineering as critical to quantum information technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores heat transfer mechanisms in heat pipes with sub-critical nanopores using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, aiming to enhance thermal management in nanoscale applications. With the increasing need for efficient cooling solutions in microelectronics and high-performance computing, nanoporous heat pipes have gained attention due to their high thermal conductivity and passive operation. This research evaluates the effects of pore size, temperature gradients, and water fill ratios on the heat transfer efficiency of heat pipes with 2 nm and 3 nm diameter nanopores. The results indicate that larger temperature gradients significantly enhance heat transfer rates, while filled heat pipes perform better than medium-filled ones, primarily due to more effective phase change and fluid flow dynamics. Notably, the 2 nm filled models show improved performance over the 3 nm models, suggesting an optimal balance between capillary action and fluid resistance at smaller pore sizes. The study also reveals that in sub-critical nanopores, surface-driven flows are more effective than traditional wicking, underscoring the role of surface interactions in optimizing heat transfer. These findings provide critical insights for designing and optimizing nanoporous heat pipes, offering practical guidance for developing more efficient thermal management systems in electronics cooling and other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heavy-holes in Ge/GeSi heterostructures show highly anisotropic gyromagnetic response with in-plane $g$-factors $g_{x,y}^*\lesssim 0.3$ and out-of-plane $g$-factor $g_z^*\gtrsim 10$. As a consequence, Rabi hot spots and dephasing sweet lines are extremely sharp and call for a careful alignment of the magnetic field in Ge spin qubit devices. We investigate how the $g$-factors can be engineered by strains. We show that uniaxial strains can raise in-plane $g$-factors above unity while leaving $g_z^*$ essentially constant. We discuss how the etching of an elongated mesa in a strained buffer can actually induce uniaxial (but inhomogeneous) strains in the heterostructure. This broadens the operational magnetic field range and enables spin manipulation by shuttling holes between neighboring dots with different $g$-factors.</description>

Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e. a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors with different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defects in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>AC driven fractional quantum Hall systems: Uncovering unexpected features</title>

Abstract: We investigate the challenges of reaching the quantum regime and generating minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) under AC driving. Using the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative (UNEP) approach, we analyze weak backscattering through a quantum point contact (QPC). In both two-terminal geometries and the "anyon collider" setup, the lower bound on photoassisted backscattering noise is set by the photoassisted current rather than the DC noise predicted by Levitov's theorem. This super-Poissonian character is confirmed within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, where Levitov's theorem is violated, challenging the conventional interpretation of "photoassisted" noise.
  In the two-terminal geometry, we show that when the QPC has a low scaling dimension, two challenges arise: first, achieving the expected power-law behavior in the DC regime, and second, maintaining the AC quantum regime, where the drive frequency exceeds the temperature, when the DC voltage component is resonant with that drive frequency. The validity of the UNEP relations imposes a lower bound on temperature and a persisting equilibrium contribution to backscattering noise. This forces us to choose a high enough scaling dimension, for which we find that it is rather the photoconductance, often overlooked, that might exhibit spikes at resonant DC voltages, providing a reliable probe of fractional charge. Moreover, we highlight that the zero-temperature limit, frequently assumed in prior studies, including X. G. Wen's foundational work, is inappropriate in this context.
  Our findings extend beyond the FQHE to coherent conductors and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under AC bias, with broader implications for quantum transport and minimal excitation engineering.</description>

      <title>Parafermions in Moir\'e Minibands</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of bosonic Bogoliubov quasiparticles</title>

Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>On the Entire Structure of the Energy Bands of 1D Moir\'{e} Superchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moir\'{e} pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moir\'{e} superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moir\'{e} superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.</description>
