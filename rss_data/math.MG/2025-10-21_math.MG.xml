      <title>A four-dimensional body of constant width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of bodies of constant width is a classical subject in convex geometry, with the three-dimensional Meissner bodies being canonical examples. This paper presents a novel geometric construction of a body of constant width in $R^4$, addressing the challenge of constructing such bodies in higher dimensions. Our method produces a natural analogue of the second Meissner body, by modifying a 4-dimensional Reuleaux simplex. The resulting body possesses tetrahedral symmetry and has a boundary composed of both smooth surfaces and a non-smooth subset of the Reuleaux 4-simplex. Furthermore, we analyze the orthogonal projection of this body onto the 3-dimensional hyperplane of its base. This "shadow" is a new 3-dimensional body of constant width with tetrahedral symmetry. It has six elliptical edges and we estimate its volume to be only slightly larger than that of the Meissner bodies.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Coarse Homotopy and Ends on Proper Geodesic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-geometric notion of ends in the context of coarse homotopy. We show that, when recontextualized as a functor from an appropriate coarse category of proper geodesic spaces, the set of ends $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$ is a coarse homotopy invariant. Further, we prove the existence of a natural surjection from the coarse path component functor $\pi_0^{\text{Crs}}(-)$ to $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$, and show that in general, this is not an injection (even when restricted to locally finite planar graphs). Finally, we begin to consider when this injection indeed exists by showing that this is the case for locally finite geometric trees, providing a number of useful preliminary lemmas on the behaviour of geodesics in this context.</description>

      <title>Sharp comparisons between sliced and standard $1$-Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein distances are widely used in practice as a computationally efficient alternative to Wasserstein distances in high dimensions. In this paper, motivated by theoretical foundations of this alternative, we prove quantitative estimates between the sliced $1$-Wasserstein distance and the $1$-Wasserstein distance. We construct a concrete example to demonstrate the exponents in the estimate is sharp. We also provide a general analysis for the case where slicing involves projections onto $k$-planes and not just lines.</description>

      <title>Random convex chains through the lens of analytic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$. The lower boundary of the convex hull of $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, together with $n$ independent uniformly distributed random points in $T$, is called a random convex chain and denoted by $T_n$. We study the random variable $f_0(T_n)$, the number of vertices of this chain. Our first result gives an explicit expression for the bivariate generating function of the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$ in terms of the Gaussian hypergeometric function. Building on this analytic representation, we apply a careful singularity analysis to derive a variety of limit theorems for $f_0(T_n)$, including a quantitative central limit theorem, a large deviation principle as well as a precise asymptotics for the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(f_0(T_n)=k+2)$. Conceptually, our results establish a novel bridge between stochastic geometry and methods from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Who Needs Crossings?: Noncrossing Linkages are Universal, and Deciding (Global) Rigidity is Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exactly settle the complexity of graph realization, graph rigidity, and graph global rigidity as applied to three types of graphs: "globally noncrossing" graphs, which avoid crossings in all of their configurations; matchstick graphs, with unit-length edges and where only noncrossing configurations are considered; and unrestricted graphs (crossings allowed) with unit edge lengths (or in the global rigidity case, edge lengths in $\{1,2\}$). We show that all nine of these questions are complete for the class $\exists\mathbb{R}$, defined by the Existential Theory of the Reals, or its complement $\forall\mathbb{R}$; in particular, each problem is (co)NP-hard.
  One of these nine results--that realization of unit-distance graphs is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete--was shown previously by Schaefer (2013), but the other eight are new. We strengthen several prior results. Matchstick graph realization was known to be NP-hard (Eades \&amp; Wormald 1990, or Cabello et al.\ 2007), but its membership in NP remained open; we show it is complete for the (possibly) larger class $\exists\mathbb{R}$. Global rigidity of graphs with edge lengths in $\{1,2\}$ was known to be coNP-hard (Saxe 1979); we show it is $\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete.
  The majority of the paper is devoted to proving an analog of Kempe's Universality Theorem--informally, "there is a linkage to sign your name"--for globally noncrossing linkages. In particular, we show that any polynomial curve $\phi(x,y)=0$ can be traced by a noncrossing linkage, settling an open problem from 2004. More generally, we show that the regions in the plane that may be traced by a noncrossing linkage are precisely the compact semialgebraic regions (plus the trivial case of the entire plane). Thus, no drawing power is lost by restricting to noncrossing linkages. We prove analogous results for matchstick linkages and unit-distance linkages as well.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many points can be placed in an $n\times n$ grid so that every (affine) line contains at most $k$ points? We prove that for $n \ge k \ge 10^{37}$ the maximum number of points is exactly $kn$. Our proof builds on the recent work of Kov\'acs, Nagy, and Szab\'o (who proved an analogous result when $k$ is at least about $\sqrt{n \log n}$), incorporating ideas of Jain and Pham. Using the same approach, we also obtain new bounds for higher-dimensional extensions of this problem.</description>

      <title>Local structure of centred tangent cones in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the geometric tangent cone to a probability measure with finite second moment. It is known that the tangent elements induced by a map belong to the $L^2_{\mu}$ closure of smooth gradients. We show that at the opposite, the elements that have barycenter 0 are characterized by a local condition, i.e. as the barycenter-free measures that are concentrated on a family of vector subspaces attached to any point. Our results rely on a decomposition of a measure into $d+1$ components, each allowing optimal plans to split mass in a fixed number of directions. We conclude by giving some links with Preiss tangent measures and illustrating the difference with Alberti and Marchese's decomposability bundle.</description>

      <title>Escaping a Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose an escaping player ("human") moves continuously at maximum speed $1$ in the interior of a region, while a pursuing player ("zombie") moves continuously at maximum speed $r$ outside the region. For what $r$ can the first player escape the region, that is, reach the boundary a positive distance away from the pursuing player, assuming optimal play by both players? We formalize a model for this infinitesimally alternating 2-player game and prove that it has a unique winner in any locally rectifiable region. Our model thus avoids pathological behaviors (where both players can have "winning strategies") previously identified for pursuit-evasion games such as the Lion and Man problem in certain metric spaces. For some specific regions, including both equilateral triangle and square, we give exact results for the critical speed ratio, above which the pursuing player can win and below which the escaping player can win (and at which the pursuing player can win). For simple polygons, we give a simple formula and polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to give a 10.89898-approximation to the critical speed ratio, and we give a pseudopolynomial-time approximation scheme for approximating the critical speed ratio arbitrarily closely. On the negative side, we prove NP-hardness of the problem for polyhedral domains in 3D, and prove stronger results (PSPACE-hardness and NP-hardness even to approximate) for generalizations to multiple escaping and pursuing players.</description>

      <title>Finding Closed Quasigeodesics on Convex Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed quasigeodesic is a closed curve on the surface of a polyhedron with at most $180^\circ$ of surface on both sides at all points; such curves can be locally unfolded straight. In 1949, Pogorelov proved that every convex polyhedron has at least three (non-self-intersecting) closed quasigeodesics, but the proof relies on a nonconstructive topological argument. We present the first finite algorithm to find a closed quasigeodesic on a given convex polyhedron, which is the first positive progress on a 1990 open problem by O'Rourke and Wyman. The algorithm also establishes a pseudopolynomial upper bound on the total number of visits to faces (number of line segments), namely, $O\left(\frac{n \, L^2}{\epsilon^2 \, \ell^2}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices of the polyhedron, $\epsilon$ is the minimum curvature of a vertex, $L$ is the length of the longest edge, and $\ell$ is the smallest distance within a face between a vertex and a nonincident edge (minimum feature size of any face). On the real RAM, the algorithm's running time is also pseudopolynomial, namely $O\left(\frac{L^2}{\epsilon^2 \, \ell^2} \, n \lg n\right)$. On a word RAM, the running time grows to $O\left(\frac{b^2 \, \Delta^{36} \, L^{146}}{\epsilon^{98} \, \ell^{146}} \, n \lg n \cdot 2^{O(|R|)}\right)$, where $\Delta \leq n$ is the polyhedron's maximum vertex degree, assuming the polyhedron's intrinsic geometry is given by constant-size radical expressions with $b$-bit integers and at most $|R|$ distinct square-roots. Along the way, we introduce the expression RAM model of computation, formalizing a connection between the real RAM and word RAM hinted at by past work on exact geometric computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that if $A$ is a Borel subset of the first Heisenberg group with $2&lt; \dim A &lt; 3$, then vertical projections of $A$ almost surely do not decrease the Hausdorff dimension of $A$, with respect to the Kor\'anyi metric. This resolves the problem in the remaining range $2 &lt; \dim A &lt; 3$. The proof relies on a variable coefficient local smoothing inequality.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Image Retrieval with an Extended b-Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a new approach on how to enhance data storage and retrieval in the Query By Image Content Systems (QBIC) by introducing the ${\rm NEM}_{\sigma}$ distance measure, satisfying the relaxed triangle inequality. By leveraging the concept of extended $b$-metric spaces, we address complex distance relationships, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of image database management. The use of ${\rm NEM}_{\sigma}$ facilitates better scalability and accuracy in large-scale image retrieval systems, optimizing both the storage and retrieval processes. The proposed method represents a significant advancement over traditional distance measures, offering enhanced flexibility and precision in the context of image content-based querying. Additionally, we take inspiration from ice flow models using ${\rm NEM}_{\sigma}$ and ${\rm NEM}_r$, adding dynamic and location-based factors to better capture details in images.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 94(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>
