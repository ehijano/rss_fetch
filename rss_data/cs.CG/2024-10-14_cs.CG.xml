      <title>T\v{r}iVis: Versatile, Reliable, and High-Performance Tool for Computing Visibility in Polygonal Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visibility is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, with numerous applications in robotics, surveillance systems, video games, and other fields. This software paper presents T\v{r}iVis, a C++ library developed by the authors for computing numerous visibility-related queries in highly complex polygonal environments. Adapting the triangular expansion algorithm (TEA), T\v{r}iVis stands out as a versatile, high-performance, more reliable and easy-to-use alternative to current solutions that is also free of heavy dependencies. Through evaluation on a challenging dataset, T\v{r}iVis has been benchmarked against existing visibility libraries. The results demonstrate that T\v{r}iVis outperforms the competing solutions by at least an order of magnitude in query times, while exhibiting more reliable runtime behavior. T\v{r}iVis is freely available for private, research, and institutional use at https://github.com/janmikulacz/trivis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Filtering Heuristic for the Sensor-Placement Problem to Discretize 2D Continuous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sensor-placement problem (SPP) within the context of discretizing large, complex continuous 2D environments into graphs for efficient task-oriented route planning. The SPP aims to minimize the number of sensors required to achieve a user-defined coverage ratio while considering a general visibility model. We propose the hybrid filtering heuristic (HFH) framework, which enhances or combines outputs of existing sensor-placement methods, incorporating a filtering step. This step eliminates redundant sensors or those contributing marginally to the coverage, ensuring the coverage ratio remains within the desired interval. We implement two versions of HFH: the basic version and a variant, HFHB, incorporating a preprocessing technique known as bucketing to accelerate region clipping. We evaluate HFH and HFHB on a dataset of large, complex polygonal environments, comparing them to several baseline methods under both unlimited and limited-range omnidirectional visibility models. The results demonstrate that HFH and HFHB outperform baselines in terms of the number of sensors required to achieve the desired coverage ratio. Additionally, HFHB significantly reduces the runtime of more competitive baseline methods. We also adapt HFHB to a visibility model with localization uncertainty, demonstrating its effectiveness up to a certain level of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks as the Semi-classical Limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks: The problem of generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks miss a principled model of their operation. A novel framework for supervised learning based on Topological Quantum Field Theory that looks particularly well suited for implementation on quantum processors has been recently explored. We propose using this framework to understand the problem of generalisation in Deep Neural Networks. More specifically, in this approach, Deep Neural Networks are viewed as the semi-classical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. A framework of this kind explains the overfitting behavior of Deep Neural Networks during the training step and the corresponding generalisation capabilities. We explore the paradigmatic case of the perceptron, which we implement as the semiclassical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. We apply a novel algorithm we developed, showing that it obtains similar results to standard neural networks, but without the need for training (optimisation).</description>
