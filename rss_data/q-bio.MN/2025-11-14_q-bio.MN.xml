      <title>Stochastic Reaction Networks Within Interacting Compartments with Content-Dependent Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks with mass-action kinetics provide a useful framework for understanding processes -- biochemical and otherwise -- in homogeneous environments. However, cellular reactions are often compartmentalized, either at the cell level or within cells, and hence non-homogeneous. A general framework for compartmentalized chemistry with dynamic compartments was proposed in (Duso and Zechner, PNAS, 2020), and the special case where the compartment dynamics do not depend on their contents was studied mathematically in (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023). In the present paper, we investigate the case in which the rate of fragmentation of a compartment depends on the abundance of some designated species inside that compartment. The main focus of this work is on providing general conditions for (positive) recurrence and non-explosivity of the models. In particular, we demonstrate that the explosivity characterization from (Anderson and Howells, Bull. Math. Biol., 2023) fails in this setting and provide new sufficient conditions for non-explosivity and positive recurrence, under the assumption that the underlying CRN admits a linear Lyapunov function. These results extend the theoretical foundation for modeling content-mediated compartment dynamics, with implications for systems such as cell division and intracellular transport.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Cooperative Biomolecular Machines: Fluctuation Relations and Hidden Detailed Balance Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.</description>

      <title>Multistationarity in semi-open Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistationarity, underlies biochemical switching and cellular decision-making. We study how multistationarity in the sequential n-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is affected when only some species are open, meaning allowed to exchange with the environment (so-called semi-open networks). Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>
