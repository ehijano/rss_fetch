      <title>Categorical generalization of spectral decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give several equivalent characterizations for a category with finite biproducts and the sum operation of arrows, and called categories satisfying these semiadditive $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{Mon}$-categories. This allow us to give equivalent structures without directly confirming the existence of biproducts. Moreover, we define a generalized notion of the spectral decomposition in semiadditive $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{Mon}$-categories. We also define the notion of a semiadditive $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{Mon}$-functor that preserves the spectral decomposition of arrows. Semiadditive $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{Mon}$-categories and semiadditive $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{Mon}$-functors include many examples.</description>

      <title>Tutte's theorem as an educational formalization project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present two results: The first result is the formalization of Tutte's theorem in Lean, a key theorem concerning matchings in graph theory. As this formalization is ready to be integrated in Lean's mathlib, it provides a valuable step in the path towards formalizing research-level mathematics in this area. The second result is a framework for doing educational formalization projects. This framework provides a structure to learn to formalize mathematics with minimal teacher input. This framework applies to both traditional academic settings and independent community-driven environments. We demonstrate the framework's use by connecting it to the process of formalizing Tutte's theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a tight connection between two models of the $\lambda$-calculus, namely Milner's encoding into the $\pi$-calculus (precisely, the Internal $\pi$-calculus), and operational game semantics (OGS). We first investigate the operational correspondence between the behaviours of the encoding provided by $\pi$ and OGS. We do so for various LTSs: the standard LTS for $\pi$ and a new `concurrent' LTS for OGS; an `output-prioritised' LTS for $\pi$ and the standard alternating LTS for OGS. We then show that the equivalences induced on $\lambda$-terms by all these LTSs (for $\pi$ and OGS) coincide. We also prove that when equivalence is based on complete traces, the `concurrent' and `alternating' variants of OGS also coincide with the `well-bracketed' variant.
  These connections allow us to transfer results and techniques between $\pi$ and OGS. In particular: we import up-to techniques from $\pi$ onto OGS; we derive congruence and compositionality results for OGS from those of $\pi$; we transport the notion of complete traces from OGS onto $\pi$, obtaining a new behavioural equivalence that yields a full abstraction result for the encoding of $\lambda$-terms with respect to contexts written in a $\lambda$-calculus extended with store.
  The study is illustrated for both call-by-value and call-by-name.</description>

      <title>Tree Rewriting Calculi for Strictly Positive Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strictly positive logics in the language $\mathscr{L}^+$, which constructs formulas from $\top$, propositional variables, conjunction, and diamond modalities. We begin with the base system $\bf K^+$, the strictly positive fragment of polymodal $\bf K$, and examine its extensions obtained by adding axioms such as monotonicity, transitivity, and the hierarchy-sensitive interaction axiom $(\sf J)$, which governs the interplay between modalities of different strengths. The strongest of these systems is the Reflection Calculus ($\bf RC$), which corresponds to the strictly positive fragment of polymodal $\bf GLP$.
  Our main contribution is a formulation of these logics as tree rewriting systems, establishing both adequacy and completeness through a correspondence between $\mathscr{L}^+$ formulas and inductively defined modal trees. We also provide a normalization of the rewriting process, which has exponential complexity when axiom $(\sf J)$ is absent; otherwise we provide a double-exponential bound. By introducing tree rewriting calculi as practical provability tools for strictly positive logics, we aim to deepen their proof-theoretic analysis and computational applications.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Rewards in Markovian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the expected value of multiplicative rewards, where rewards obtained in each step are multiplied (instead of the usual addition), in Markov chains (MCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). One of the key differences to additive rewards is that the expected value may diverge to infinity not only due to recurrent, but also due to transient states. For MCs, computing the value is shown to be possible in polynomial time given an oracle for the comparison of succinctly represented integers (CSRI), which is only known to be solvable in polynomial time subject to number-theoretic conjectures. Interestingly, distinguishing whether the value is infinite or 0 is at least as hard as CSRI, while determining if it is one of these two can be done in polynomial time. In MDPs, the optimal value can be computed in polynomial space. Further refined complexity results and results on the complexity of optimal schedulers are presented. The techniques developed for MDPs additionally allow to solve the multiplicative variant of the stochastic shortest path problem. Finally, for MCs and MDPs where an absorbing state is reached almost surely, all considered problems are solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Automated Consistency Analysis for Legal Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business contracts, particularly sale and purchase agreements, often contain a large number of clauses and are correspondingly long and complex. In practice, it is therefore a great challenge to keep track of their legal context and to identify and avoid inconsistencies in such contracts. Against this background, we describe a method and tool called ContractCheck which allows for the consistency analysis of legal contracts, in particular Share Purchase Agreements (SPAs). In order to identify the concepts that are relevant for an analysis we define an ontology for SPAs. The analysis is, then, based on an encoding of the preconditions for the execution of the clauses of an SPA, as well as on a set of proposed consistency constraints formalized using decidable fragments of First-Order Logic (FOL). Based on the ontology for SPAs, textual SPAs are first encoded in a structured natural language format that we refer to as ``blocks''. ContractCheck interprets these blocks and constraints and translates them into assertions formulated in FOL. It then invokes a Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver in order to check the executability of a considered contract, either by providing a satisfying model, or by proving the existence of conflicting clauses that prevent the contract from being executed. We illustrate the application of ContractCheck to concrete SPAs, including one example of an SPA of realistic size and complexity, and conclude by suggesting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Expectation-based Analysis of Higher-Order Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper extends the expectation transformer based analysis of higher-order probabilistic programs to the quantum higher-order setting. The quantum language we are considering can be seen as an extension of PCF, featuring unbounded recursion. The language admits classical and quantum data, as well as a tick operator to account for costs. Our quantum expectation transformer translates such programs into a functional, non-quantum language, enriched with a type and operations over so called cost-structures. By specializing the cost-structure, this methodology makes it possible to study several expectation based properties of quantum programs, such as average case cost, probabilities of events or expected values, in terms of the translated non-quantum programs, this way enabling classical reasoning techniques. As a show-case, we adapt a refinement type system, capable of reasoning on upper-bounds.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Dominating Set and Related Problems Using Twin-Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial vertex cover and partial dominating set are two well-investigated optimization problems. While they are $\rm W[1]$-hard on general graphs, they have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on many sparse graph classes, including nowhere-dense classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that these problems are also fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the twin-width of a graph. Indeed, we establish a more general result: every graph property that can be expressed by a logical formula of the form $\phi\equiv\exists x_1\ldots \exists x_k \#y\,\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y)\ge t$, where $\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula, $t$ is an arbitrary number, and $\#y$ is a counting quantifier, can be evaluated in time $f(d,k)n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $d$ is the width of a contraction sequence that is part of the input. Notably, this includes problems such as connected partial dominating set and independent partial dominating set.</description>

      <title>Witnessed Symmetric Choice and Interpretations in Fixed-Point Logic with Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07869v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the core of the quest for a logic for PTime is a mismatch between algorithms making arbitrary choices and isomorphism-invariant logics. One approach to overcome this problem is witnessed symmetric choice. It allows for choices from definable orbits which are certified by definable witnessing automorphisms.
  We consider the extension of fixed-point logic with counting (IFPC) with witnessed symmetric choice (IFPC+WSC) and a further extension with an interpretation operator (IFPC+WSC+I). The latter operator evaluates a subformula in the structure defined by an interpretation. This structure possibly has other automorphisms exploitable by the WSC-operator. For similar extensions of pure fixed-point logic (IFP) it is known that IFP+WSCI simulates counting which IFP+WSC fails to do. For IFPC+WSC it is unknown whether the interpretation operator increases expressiveness and thus allows studying the relation between WSC and interpretations beyond counting.
  We separate IFPC+WSC from IFPC+WSCI by showing that IFPC+WSC is not closed under FO-interpretations. By the same argument, we answer an open question of Dawar and Richerby regarding non-witnessed symmetric choice in IFP. Additionally, we prove that nesting WSC-operators increases the expressiveness using the so-called CFI graphs. We show that if IFPC+WSC+I canonizes a particular class of base graphs, then it also canonizes the corresponding CFI graphs. This differs from various other logics, where CFI graphs provide difficult instances.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>A Fourfold Pathogen Reference Ontology Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infectious diseases remain a critical global health challenge, and the integration of standardized ontologies plays a vital role in managing related data. The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases. We adopt the "hub and spoke" methodology to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO). The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing and analysis.</description>
