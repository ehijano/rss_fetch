      <title>Handle number is not always realized by a minimal genus Seifert surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct genus one knots whose handle number is only realized by Seifert surfaces of non-minimal genus. These are counterexamples to the conjecture that the Seifert genus of a knot is its Morse-Novikov genus. As the Morse-Novikov genus may be greater than the Seifert genus, we define the genus $g$ Morse-Novikov number $MN_g(L)$ as the minimum handle number among Seifert surfaces for $L$ of genus $g$. Since, as we further show, the Morse-Novikov genus and the minimal genus Morse-Novikov number are additive under connected sum of knots, it then follows that there exists examples for which the discrepancies between Seifert genus and Morse-Novikov genus and between the Morse-Novikov number and the minimal genus Morse-Novikov number can be made arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Strongly chiral rational homology spheres with hyperbolic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $m\geq0$ and any prime $p\equiv3\ \mathrm{(mod \ 4)}$, we construct strongly chiral rational homology $(4m+3)$-spheres, which have real hyperbolic fundamental groups and only non-zero integral intermediate homology groups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ in degrees $1,2m+1$ and $4m+1$. This gives group theoretic analogues in high dimensions of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic rational homology $3$-spheres, as well as of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic manifolds of any dimension that are not rational homology spheres, which was shown by Weinberger. One of our tools will be $r$-spins. We thus investigate the relationship between the sets of degrees of self-maps of a given manifold and its $r$-spins, and give classes of manifolds for which the sets are equal.</description>

      <title>Good real images of complex maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several results regarding the homology and homotopy type of images of real maps and their complexification. In particular, we study the local behavior of singular points after deformations. In this context, we prove a restrictive necessary condition for a real perturbation to have the same homology than its complexification, which is known as good real perturbation. We prove the conjecture of Marar and Mond stating that for singularities from $\mathbb{C}^n$ to $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, a good real perturbation is homotopy equivalent to its complexification, and show a generalization in other dimensions. Applications to $M$-deformations and other concepts as well as examples are given.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for hyperbolic string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an analog of Mirzakhani's recursion relation for hyperbolic string vertices and investigate its implications for closed string field theory. Central to our construction are systolic volumes: the Weil-Petersson volumes of regions in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces whose elements have systoles $L \geq 0$. These volumes can be shown to satisfy a recursion relation through a modification of Mirzakhani's recursion as long as $L \leq 2 \sinh^{-1} 1$. Applying the pants decomposition of Riemann surfaces to off-shell string amplitudes, we promote this recursion to hyperbolic string field theory and demonstrate the higher order vertices are determined by the cubic vertex iteratively for any background. Such structure implies the solutions of closed string field theory obey a quadratic integral equation. We illustrate the utility of our approach in an example of a stubbed scalar theory.</description>
