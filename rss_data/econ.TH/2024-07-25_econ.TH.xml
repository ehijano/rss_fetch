      <title>Colonel Blotto Game: An Analysis and Extension to Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colonel Blotto game, introduced by Borel in the 1920s, is often used for modeling various real-life settings, such as elections, lobbying, etc. The game is based on the allocation of limited resources by players to a set of fields. Each field is ``won'' and a corresponding field-specific value is obtained by the player who sends the most resources. In this paper, we formulate a discrete Blotto game played on a general \textit{accessibility network} (i.e., the bipartite graph made of players and the fields they can allocate resources to). The primary goal is to find how the topology of the accessibility network controls the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium allocations, and how it affects the fraction of fields that are entered and the average payoff of players at equilibrium. We establish that, in a 2-regular topology, when the values of fields are close enough and the number of players is not a multiple of 4, then there is a unique equilbrium. We also prove that players are better off and fields are more likely to be entered in a regular topology than a random topology. We find numerically that dispersion of field weights negatively affects average player payoff. The main contribution is a framework for analyzing contests where players are permitted access to some (but not necessarily all) venues of competition.</description>

      <title>Quantity Limits on Addictive Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addiction is a major societal issue leading to billions in healthcare losses per year. Policy makers often introduce ad hoc quantity limits-limits on the consumption or possession of a substance-something which current economic models of addiction have failed to address. This paper enriches Bernheim and Rangel (2004)'s model of addiction driven by cue-triggered decisions by incorporating endogenous choice of how much of the addictive good to consume, instead of just whether or not consumption happens. Stricter quality limits improve welfare as long as they do not preclude the myopically optimal level of consumption.</description>

      <title>Robust Comparative Statics with Misspecified Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel monotone comparative statics results for steady state behavior in a dynamic optimization environment with misspecified Bayesian learning. We consider a generalized framework, based on Esponda and Pouzo (2021), wherein a Bayesian learner facing a dynamic optimization problem has a prior on a set of parameterized transition probability functions (models) but is misspecified in the sense that the true process is not within this set. In the steady state, the learner infers the model that best-fits the data generated by their actions, and in turn, their actions are optimally chosen given their inferred model. We characterize conditions on the primitives of the environment, and in particular, over the set of models under which the steady state distribution over states and actions and inferred models exhibit monotonic behavior. Further, we offer a new theorem on the existence of a steady state on the basis of a monotonicity argument. Lastly, we provide an upper bound on the cost of misspecification, again in terms of the primitives of the environment. We demonstrate the utility of our results for several environments of general interest, including forecasting models, dynamic effort-task, and optimal consumption-savings problems.</description>

      <title>Monotone Equilibrium Design for Matching Markets with Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study monotone equilibrium design by a planner who chooses an interval of reactions that receivers take before senders and receivers move in matching markets with signaling. Given the convex efficiency frontier over sender surplus and receiver surplus generated by the interval delegation, the optimal reaction interval crucially depends on the ripple effect of its lower bound and on the trade-off between matching inefficiency and signaling cost savings in the top pooling region generated by its upper bound. Our analysis generates cohesive market design results that integrate the literature on minimum wage, firm size distribution, and relative risk aversion.</description>
