      <title>Multi-modal Cross-domain Self-supervised Pre-training for fMRI and EEG Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroimaging techniques including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promise in detecting functional abnormalities in various brain disorders. However, existing studies often focus on a single domain or modality, neglecting the valuable complementary information offered by multiple domains from both fMRI and EEG, which is crucial for a comprehensive representation of disorder pathology. This limitation poses a challenge in effectively leveraging the synergistic information derived from these modalities. To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Cross-domain Self-supervised Pre-training Model (MCSP), a novel approach that leverages self-supervised learning to synergize multi-modal information across spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Our model employs cross-domain self-supervised loss that bridges domain differences by implementing domain-specific data augmentation and contrastive loss, enhancing feature discrimination. Furthermore, MCSP introduces cross-modal self-supervised loss to capitalize on the complementary information of fMRI and EEG, facilitating knowledge distillation within domains and maximizing cross-modal feature convergence. We constructed a large-scale pre-training dataset and pretrained MCSP model by leveraging proposed self-supervised paradigms to fully harness multimodal neuroimaging data. Through comprehensive experiments, we have demonstrated the superior performance and generalizability of our model on multiple classification tasks. Our study contributes a significant advancement in the fusion of fMRI and EEG, marking a novel integration of cross-domain features, which enriches the existing landscape of neuroimaging research, particularly within the context of mental disorder studies.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Image Compression for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While learning based compression techniques for images have outperformed traditional methods, they have not been widely adopted in machine learning pipelines. This is largely due to lack of standardization and lack of retention of salient features needed for such tasks. Decompression of images have taken a back seat in recent years while the focus has shifted to an image's utility in performing machine learning based analysis on top of them. Thus the demand for compression pipelines that incorporate such features from images has become ever present. The methods outlined in the report build on the recent work done on learning based image compression techniques to incorporate downstream tasks in them. We propose various methods of finetuning and enhancing different parts of pretrained compression encoding pipeline and present the results of our investigation regarding the performance of vision tasks using compression based pipelines.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Bone Marrow Lesion Detection from Knee MRI Segmentation Using Mask Inpainting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) are critical indicators of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Since they often appear as small, irregular structures with indistinguishable edges in knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs), effective detection of BMLs in MRI is vital for OA diagnosis and treatment. This paper proposes a semi-supervised local anomaly detection method using mask inpainting models for identification of BMLs in high-resolution knee MRI, effectively integrating a 3D femur bone segmentation model, a large mask inpainting model, and a series of post-processing techniques. The method was evaluated using MRIs at various resolutions from a subset of the public Osteoarthritis Initiative database. Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and pixel-level sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy showed an advantage over the multiresolution knowledge distillation method-a state-of-the-art global anomaly detection method. Especially, segmentation performance is enhanced on higher-resolution images, achieving an over two times performance increase on the Dice score and the IoU score at a 448x448 resolution level. We also demonstrate that with increasing size of the BML region, both the Dice and IoU scores improve as the proportion of distinguishable boundary decreases. The identified BML masks can serve as markers for downstream tasks such as segmentation and classification. The proposed method has shown a potential in improving BML detection, laying a foundation for further advances in imaging-based OA research.</description>

      <title>Toward Deep Learning-based Segmentation and Quantitative Analysis of Cervical Spinal Cord Magnetic Resonance Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposal discusses two challenges in the field of medical image analysis: the multi-parametric investigation on microstructural and macrostructural characteristics of the cervical spinal cord and deep learning-based medical image segmentation. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of the cervical spinal cord within a healthy population. Unlike most previous studies, which required medical professionals to perform functional examinations using metrics like the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score or the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale, this research focuses solely on Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord. Second, we employ cutting-edge deep learning-based segmentation methods to achieve highly accurate macrostructural measurements from MR images. To this end, we propose an enhanced UNet-like Transformer-based framework with attentive skip connections. This paper reports on the problem domain, proposed solutions, current status of research, and expected contributions.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Promoting Missing Modality Brain Tumor Segmentation with Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is often based on multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in clinical practice, certain modalities of MRI may be missing, which presents an even more difficult scenario. To cope with this challenge, knowledge distillation has emerged as one promising strategy. However, recent efforts typically overlook the modality gaps and thus fail to learn invariant feature representations across different modalities. Such drawback consequently leads to limited performance for both teachers and students. To ameliorate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that aligns latent features of involved modalities to a well-defined distribution anchor. As a major contribution, we prove that our novel training paradigm ensures a tight evidence lower bound, thus theoretically certifying its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbones validate that the proposed paradigm can enable invariant feature representations and produce a teacher with narrowed modality gaps. This further offers superior guidance for missing modality students, achieving an average improvement of 1.75 on dice score.</description>

      <title>MambaEviScrib: Mamba and Evidence-Guided Consistency Make CNN Work Robustly for Scribble-Based Weakly Supervised Ultrasound Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures and lesions from ultrasound images contributes to disease assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on sparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the potential to reduce annotation costs. However, ultrasound images often suffer from issues such as poor contrast, unclear edges, as well as varying sizes and locations of lesions. This makes it challenging for convolutional networks with local receptive fields to extract global morphological features from the sparse information provided by scribble annotations. Recently, the visual Mamba based on state space sequence models (SSMs) has significantly reduced computational complexity while ensuring long-range dependencies compared to Transformers. Consequently, for the first time, we apply scribble-based WSL to ultrasound image segmentation and propose a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba framework. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of ultrasound images and insufficient supervision signals, existing consistency regularization often filters out predictions near decision boundaries, leading to unstable predictions of edges. Hence, we introduce the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence to devise an Evidence-Guided Consistency (EGC) strategy, which leverages high-evidence predictions more likely to occur near high-density regions to guide low-evidence predictions potentially present near decision boundaries for optimization. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the Mamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based on the EGC strategy. Extensive experiments on four ultrasound public datasets for binary-class and multi-class segmentation demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. The scribble-annotated dataset and code will be made available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/MambaEviScrib.</description>

      <title>Efficient Semantic Diffusion Architectures for Model Training on Synthetic Echocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the utility of diffusion generative models to efficiently synthesise datasets that effectively train deep learning models for image analysis. Specifically, we propose novel $\Gamma$-distribution Latent Denoising Diffusion Models (LDMs) designed to generate semantically guided synthetic cardiac ultrasound images with improved computational efficiency. We also investigate the potential of using these synthetic images as a replacement for real data in training deep networks for left-ventricular segmentation and binary echocardiogram view classification tasks. We compared six diffusion models in terms of the computational cost of generating synthetic 2D echo data, the visual realism of the resulting images, and the performance, on real data, of downstream tasks (segmentation and classification) trained using these synthetic echoes. We compare various diffusion strategies and ODE solvers for their impact on segmentation and classification performance. The results show that our propose architectures significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining or improving downstream task performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. While other diffusion models generated more realistic-looking echo images at higher computational cost, our research suggests that for model training, visual realism is not necessarily related to model performance, and considerable compute costs can be saved by using more efficient models.</description>

      <title>Multi-sensor Learning Enables Information Transfer across Different Sensory Data and Augments Multi-modality Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modality imaging is widely used in clinical practice and biomedical research to gain a comprehensive understanding of an imaging subject. Currently, multi-modality imaging is accomplished by post hoc fusion of independently reconstructed images under the guidance of mutual information or spatially registered hardware, which limits the accuracy and utility of multi-modality imaging. Here, we investigate a data-driven multi-modality imaging (DMI) strategy for synergetic imaging of CT and MRI. We reveal two distinct types of features in multi-modality imaging, namely intra- and inter-modality features, and present a multi-sensor learning (MSL) framework to utilize the crossover inter-modality features for augmented multi-modality imaging. The MSL imaging approach breaks down the boundaries of traditional imaging modalities and allows for optimal hybridization of CT and MRI, which maximizes the use of sensory data. We showcase the effectiveness of our DMI strategy through synergetic CT-MRI brain imaging. The principle of DMI is quite general and holds enormous potential for various DMI applications across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Classification on MRI in Light of Molecular Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quality Control of Whole Slide Pathology Images with Human-in-the-loop Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) are being widely used to develop deep learning-based diagnostic solutions, especially for precision oncology. Most of these diagnostic softwares are vulnerable to biases and impurities in the training and test data which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses. For instance, WSIs contain multiple types of tissue regions, at least some of which might not be relevant to the diagnosis. We introduce HistoROI, a robust yet lightweight deep learning-based classifier to segregate WSI into six broad tissue regions -- epithelium, stroma, lymphocytes, adipose, artifacts, and miscellaneous. HistoROI is trained using a novel human-in-the-loop and active learning paradigm that ensures variations in training data for labeling-efficient generalization. HistoROI consistently performs well across multiple organs, despite being trained on only a single dataset, demonstrating strong generalization. Further, we have examined the utility of HistoROI in improving the performance of downstream deep learning-based tasks using the CAMELYON breast cancer lymph node and TCGA lung cancer datasets. For the former dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for metastasis versus normal tissue of a neural network trained using weakly supervised learning increased from 0.88 to 0.92 by filtering the data using HistoROI. Similarly, the AUC increased from 0.88 to 0.93 for the classification between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma on the lung cancer dataset. We also found that the performance of the HistoROI improves upon HistoQC for artifact detection on a test dataset of 93 annotated WSIs. The limitations of the proposed model are analyzed, and potential extensions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>MCDDPM: Multichannel Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in brain MRI scans using supervised deep learning methods presents challenges due to anatomical diversity and labor-intensive requirement of pixel-level annotations. Generative models like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and their variants like pDDPM, mDDPM, cDDPM have recently emerged to be powerful alternatives to perform unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans. These methods leverage frame-level labels of healthy brains to generate healthy tissues in brain MRI scans. During inference, when an anomalous (or unhealthy) scan image is presented as an input, these models generate a healthy scan image corresponding to the input anomalous scan, and the difference map between the generated healthy scan image and the original anomalous scan image provide the necessary pixel level identification of abnormal tissues. The generated healthy images from the DDPM, pDDPM and mDDPM models however suffer from fidelity issues and contain artifacts that do not have medical significance. While cDDPM achieves slightly better fidelity and artifact suppression, it requires huge memory footprint and is computationally expensive than the other DDPM based models. In this work, we propose an improved version of DDPM called Multichannel Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MCDDPM) for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI scans. Our proposed model achieves high fidelity by making use of additional information from the healthy images during the training process, enriching the representation power of DDPM models, with a computational cost and memory requirements on par with DDPM, pDDPM and mDDPM models. Experimental results on multiple datasets (e.g. BraTS20, BraTS21) demonstrate promising performance of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/vivekkumartri/MCDDPM.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Unmixing of Agricultural Images taken from UAV Using Adapted U-Net Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperspectral unmixing method is an algorithm that extracts material (usually called endmember) data from hyperspectral data cube pixels along with their abundances. Due to a lower spatial resolution of hyperspectral sensors data in each of the pixels may contain mixed information from multiple endmembers. In this paper we create a hyperspectral unmixing dataset, created from blueberry field data gathered by a hyperspectral camera mounted on a UAV. We also propose a hyperspectral unmixing algorithm based on U-Net network architecture to achieve more accurate unmixing results on existing and newly created hyperspectral unmixing datasets.</description>

      <title>One Shot GANs for Long Tail Problem in Skin Lesion Dataset using novel content space assessment metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long tail problems frequently arise in the medical field, particularly due to the scarcity of medical data for rare conditions. This scarcity often leads to models overfitting on such limited samples. Consequently, when training models on datasets with heavily skewed classes, where the number of samples varies significantly, a problem emerges. Training on such imbalanced datasets can result in selective detection, where a model accurately identifies images belonging to the majority classes but disregards those from minority classes. This causes the model to lack generalizability, preventing its use on newer data. This poses a significant challenge in developing image detection and diagnosis models for medical image datasets. To address this challenge, the One Shot GANs model was employed to augment the tail class of HAM10000 dataset by generating additional samples. Furthermore, to enhance accuracy, a novel metric tailored to suit One Shot GANs was utilized.</description>

Abstract: Milk is a highly important consumer for Americans and the health of the cows' teats directly affects the quality of the milk. Traditionally, veterinarians manually assessed teat health by visually inspecting teat-end hyperkeratosis during the milking process which is limited in time, usually only tens of seconds, and weakens the accuracy of the health assessment of cows' teats. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for cows' teat-end health assessment. However, there are challenges in using CNNs for cows' teat-end health assessment, such as complex environments, changing positions and postures of cows' teats, and difficulty in identifying cows' teats from images. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cows' teats self-attention residual convolutional neural network (CTSAR-CNN) model that combines residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms to assist commercial farms in the health assessment of cows' teats by classifying the magnitude of teat-end hyperkeratosis using digital images. The results showed that upon integrating residual connectivity and self-attention mechanisms, the accuracy of CTSAR-CNN has been improved. This research illustrates that CTSAR-CNN can be more adaptable and speedy to assist veterinarians in assessing the health of cows' teats and ultimately benefit the dairy industry.</description>

      <title>Survival Prediction in Lung Cancer through Multi-Modal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival prediction is a crucial task associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. This paper presents a novel approach to survival prediction by harnessing comprehensive information from CT and PET scans, along with associated Genomic data. Current methods rely on either a single modality or the integration of multiple modalities for prediction without adequately addressing associations across patients or modalities. We aim to develop a robust predictive model for survival outcomes by integrating multi-modal imaging data with genetic information while accounting for associations across patients and modalities. We learn representations for each modality via a self-supervised module and harness the semantic similarities across the patients to ensure the embeddings are aligned closely. However, optimizing solely for global relevance is inadequate, as many pairs sharing similar high-level semantics, such as tumor type, are inadvertently pushed apart in the embedding space. To address this issue, we use a cross-patient module (CPM) designed to harness inter-subject correspondences. The CPM module aims to bring together embeddings from patients with similar disease characteristics. Our experimental evaluation of the dataset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in predicting survival outcomes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging CAM Algorithms for Explaining Medical Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve prevailing results in segmentation tasks nowadays and represent the state-of-the-art for image-based analysis. However, the understanding of the accurate decision-making process of a CNN is rather unknown. The research area of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) primarily revolves around understanding and interpreting this black-box behavior. One way of interpreting a CNN is the use of class activation maps (CAMs) that represent heatmaps to indicate the importance of image areas for the prediction of the CNN. For classification tasks, a variety of CAM algorithms exist. But for segmentation tasks, only one CAM algorithm for the interpretation of the output of a CNN exist. We propose a transfer between existing classification- and segmentation-based methods for more detailed, explainable, and consistent results which show salient pixels in semantic segmentation tasks. The resulting Seg-HiRes-Grad CAM is an extension of the segmentation-based Seg-Grad CAM with the transfer to the classification-based HiRes CAM. Our method improves the previously-mentioned existing segmentation-based method by adjusting it to recently published classification-based methods. Especially for medical image segmentation, this transfer solves existing explainability disadvantages.</description>

      <title>Devil is in Details: Locality-Aware 3D Abdominal CT Volume Generation for Self-Supervised Organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of medical image analysis, self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged to alleviate labeling demands, while still facing the challenge of training data scarcity owing to escalating resource requirements and privacy constraints. Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively. These results underscore the potential of synthetic data to advance self-supervised learning in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GANs with Contrastive Learning-Based Multistage Progressive Finetuning SNN and RL-Based External Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep learning in cancer research, particularly in early diagnosis, case understanding, and treatment strategy design, emphasizes the need for high-quality data. Generative AI, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has emerged as a leading solution to challenges like class imbalance, robust learning, and model training, while addressing issues stemming from patient privacy and the scarcity of real data. Despite their promise, GANs face several challenges, both inherent and specific to histopathology data. Inherent issues include training imbalance, mode collapse, linear learning from insufficient discriminator feedback, and hard boundary convergence due to stringent feedback. Histopathology data presents a unique challenge with its complex representation, high spatial resolution, and multiscale features. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of two components. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network (MFT-SNN) for assessing the similarity between histopathology patches. Second, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO) within the GAN training loop, serving as a reward signal generator. The modified discriminator loss function incorporates a weighted reward, guiding the GAN to maximize this reward while minimizing loss. This approach offers an external optimization guide to the discriminator, preventing generator overfitting and ensuring smooth convergence. Our proposed solution has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) GANs and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic model, outperforming previous SOTA across various metrics, including FID score, KID score, Perceptual Path Length, and downstream classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI in Medical Imaging project aims to enhance the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Image Data Commons (IDC) by developing nnU-Net models and providing AI-assisted segmentations for cancer radiology images. We created high-quality, AI-annotated imaging datasets for 11 IDC collections. These datasets include images from various modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), covering the lungs, breast, brain, kidneys, prostate, and liver. The nnU-Net models were trained using open-source datasets. A portion of the AI-generated annotations was reviewed and corrected by radiologists. Both the AI and radiologist annotations were encoded in compliance with the the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard, ensuring seamless integration into the IDC collections. All models, images, and annotations are publicly accessible, facilitating further research and development in cancer imaging. This work supports the advancement of imaging tools and algorithms by providing comprehensive and accurate annotated datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The U-Net model has consistently demonstrated strong performance in the field of medical image segmentation, with various improvements and enhancements made since its introduction. This paper presents a novel architecture that integrates KAN networks with U-Net, leveraging the powerful nonlinear representation capabilities of KAN networks alongside the established strengths of U-Net. We introduce a KAN-convolution dual-channel structure that enables the model to more effectively capture both local and global features. We explore effective methods for fusing features extracted by KAN with those obtained through convolutional layers, utilizing an auxiliary network to facilitate this integration process. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets show that our model performs well in terms of accuracy, indicating that the KAN-convolution dual-channel approach has significant potential in medical image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Reducing Overtreatment of Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules Using a Multimodal Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Molecular testing (MT) classifies cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules as benign or malignant with high sensitivity but low positive predictive value (PPV), only using molecular profiles, ignoring ultrasound (US) imaging and biopsy. We address this limitation by applying attention multiple instance learning (AMIL) to US images.
  Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 333 patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules at UCLA medical center (259 benign, 74 malignant). A multi-modal deep learning AMIL model was developed, combining US images and MT to classify the nodules as benign or malignant and enhance the malignancy risk stratification of MT.
  Results: The final AMIL model matched MT sensitivity (0.946) while significantly improving PPV (0.477 vs 0.448 for MT alone), indicating fewer false positives while maintaining high sensitivity.
  Conclusion: Our approach reduces false positives compared to MT while maintaining the same ability to identify positive cases, potentially reducing unnecessary benign thyroid resections in patients with indeterminate nodules.</description>

      <title>EEPNet: Efficient Edge Pixel-based Matching Network for Cross-Modal Dynamic Registration between LiDAR and Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multisensor fusion is essential for autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive, analyze, and plan their trajectories within complex environments. This typically involves the integration of data from LiDAR sensors and cameras, which necessitates high-precision and real-time registration. Current methods for registering LiDAR point clouds with images face significant challenges due to inherent modality differences and computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose EEPNet, an advanced network that leverages reflectance maps obtained from point cloud projections to enhance registration accuracy. The introduction of point cloud projections substantially mitigates cross-modality differences at the network input level, while the inclusion of reflectance data improves performance in scenarios with limited spatial information of point cloud within the camera's field of view. Furthermore, by employing edge pixels for feature matching and incorporating an efficient matching optimization layer, EEPNet markedly accelerates real-time registration tasks. Experimental validation demonstrates that EEPNet achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions offer significant advancements in autonomous perception systems, paving the way for robust and efficient sensor fusion in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Tri-Cam: Practical Eye Gaze Tracking via Camera Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As human eyes serve as conduits of rich information, unveiling emotions, intentions, and even aspects of an individual's health and overall well-being, gaze tracking also enables various human-computer interaction applications, as well as insights in psychological and medical research. However, existing gaze tracking solutions fall short at handling free user movement, and also require laborious user effort in system calibration. We introduce Tri-Cam, a practical deep learning-based gaze tracking system using three affordable RGB webcams. It features a split network structure for efficient training, as well as designated network designs to handle the separated gaze tracking tasks. Tri-Cam is also equipped with an implicit calibration module, which makes use of mouse click opportunities to reduce calibration overhead on the user's end. We evaluate Tri-Cam against Tobii, the state-of-the-art commercial eye tracker, achieving comparable accuracy, while supporting a wider free movement area. In conclusion, Tri-Cam provides a user-friendly, affordable, and robust gaze tracking solution that could practically enable various applications.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Image Coding for Joint Human-Machine Vision with Multi-Path Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image coding for multi-task applications, catering to both human perception and machine vision, has been extensively investigated. Existing methods often rely on multiple task-specific encoder-decoder pairs, leading to high overhead of parameter and bitrate usage, or face challenges in multi-objective optimization under a unified representation, failing to achieve both performance and efficiency. To this end, we propose Multi-Path Aggregation (MPA) integrated into existing coding models for joint human-machine vision, unifying the feature representation with an all-in-one architecture. MPA employs a predictor to allocate latent features among task-specific paths based on feature importance varied across tasks, maximizing the utility of shared features while preserving task-specific features for subsequent refinement. Leveraging feature correlations, we develop a two-stage optimization strategy to alleviate multi-task performance degradation. Upon the reuse of shared features, as low as 1.89% parameters are further augmented and fine-tuned for a specific task, which completely avoids extensive optimization of the entire model. Experimental results show that MPA achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in both task-specific and multi-objective optimization across human viewing and machine analysis tasks. Moreover, our all-in-one design supports seamless transitions between human- and machine-oriented reconstruction, enabling task-controllable interpretation without altering the unified model.

      <title>GrokLST: Towards High-Resolution Benchmark and Toolkit for Land Surface Temperature Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for environmental studies, but obtaining high-resolution LST data remains challenging due to the spatio-temporal trade-off in satellite remote sensing. Guided LST downscaling has emerged as a solution, but current methods often neglect spatial non-stationarity and lack a open-source ecosystem for deep learning methods. To address these limitations, we propose the Modality-Conditional Large Selective Kernel (MoCoLSK) Networks, a novel architecture that dynamically fuses multi-modal data through modality-conditioned projections. MoCoLSK re-engineers our previous LSKNet to achieve a confluence of dynamic receptive field adjustment and multi-modal feature integration, leading to enhanced LST prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we establish the GrokLST project, a comprehensive open-source ecosystem featuring the GrokLST dataset, a high-resolution benchmark, and the GrokLST toolkit, an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit encapsulating MoCoLSK alongside 40+ state-of-the-art approaches. Extensive experimental results validate MoCoLSK's effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies and subtle variations within multispectral data, outperforming existing methods in LST downscaling. Our code, dataset, and toolkit are available at https://github.com/GrokCV/GrokLST.</description>

      <title>Controlling sharpness, SNR and SAR for 3D FSE at 7T by end-to-end learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To non-heuristically identify dedicated variable flip angle (VFA) schemes optimized for the point-spread function (PSF) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multiple tissues in 3D FSE sequences with very long echo trains at 7T. Methods: The proposed optimization considers predefined SAR constraints and target contrast using an end-to-end learning framework. The cost function integrates components for contrast fidelity (SNR) and a penalty term to minimize image blurring (PSF) for multiple tissues. By adjusting the weights of PSF/SNR cost-function components, PSF- and SNR-optimized VFAs were derived and tested in vivo using both the open-source Pulseq standard on two volunteers as well as vendor protocols on a 7T MRI system with parallel transmit extension on three volunteers. Results: PSF-optimized VFAs resulted in significantly reduced image blurring compared to standard VFAs for T2w while maintaining contrast fidelity. Small white and gray matter structures, as well as blood vessels, are more visible with PSF-optimized VFAs. Quantitative analysis shows that the optimized VFA yields 50% less deviation from a sinc-like reference PSF than the standard VFA. The SNR-optimized VFAs yielded images with significantly improved SNR in a white and gray matter region relative to standard (81.2\pm18.4 vs. 41.2\pm11.5, respectively) as trade-off for elevated image blurring. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of end-to-end learning frameworks to optimize VFA schemes in very long echo trains for 3D FSE acquisition at 7T in terms of PSF and SNR. It paves the way for fast and flexible adjustment of the trade-off between PSF and SNR for 3D FSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific imaging of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies is often accomplished with pushbroom cameras. Craters with elliptical rims are common objects of interest within the images produced by such sensors. This work provides a framework to analyze the appearance of crater rims in pushbroom images. With knowledge of only common ellipse parameters describing the crater rim, explicit formulations are developed and shown to be convenient for drawing the apparent crater in pushbroom images. Implicit forms are also developed and indicate the orbital conditions under which craters form conics in images. Several numerical examples are provided which demonstrate how different forms of crater rim projections can be interpreted and used in practice.</description>

      <title>Dual Encoder GAN Inversion for High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction from Single Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D GAN inversion aims to project a single image into the latent space of a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), thereby achieving 3D geometry reconstruction. While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse viewpoints. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. Experiments reveal that our approach surpasses the existing encoder training methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>MCU-Net: A Multi-prior Collaborative Deep Unfolding Network with Gates-controlled Spatial Attention for Accelerated MR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated significant potential in accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, they often encounter high computational costs and slow convergence rates. Besides, they struggle to fully exploit the complementarity when incorporating multiple priors. In this study, we propose a multi-prior collaborative DUN, termed MCU-Net, to address these limitations. Our method features a parallel structure consisting of different optimization-inspired subnetworks based on low-rank and sparsity, respectively. We design a gates-controlled spatial attention module (GSAM), evaluating the relative confidence (RC) and overall confidence (OC) maps for intermediate reconstructions produced by different subnetworks. RC allocates greater weights to the image regions where each subnetwork excels, enabling precise element-wise collaboration. We design correction modules to enhance the effectiveness in regions where both subnetworks exhibit limited performance, as indicated by low OC values, thereby obviating the need for additional branches. The gate units within GSAMs are designed to preserve necessary information across multiple iterations, improving the accuracy of the learned confidence maps and enhancing robustness against accumulated errors. Experimental results on multiple datasets show significant improvements on PSNR and SSIM results with relatively low FLOPs compared to cutting-edge methods. Additionally, the proposed strategy can be conveniently applied to various DUN structures to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Since the era of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been extensively studied and widely used in medical image classification tasks. Unfortunately, CNN's limitations in modeling long-range dependencies result in poor classification performances. In contrast, ViTs are hampered by the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism, making them difficult to deploy in real-world settings with limited computational resources. Recent studies have shown that state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by it, we proposed MedMamba, the first Vision Mamba for generalized medical image classification. Concretely, we introduced a novel hybrid basic block named SS-Conv-SSM, which purely integrates the convolutional layers for extracting local features with the abilities of SSM to capture long-range dependencies, aiming to model medical images from different image modalities efficiently. By employing the grouped convolution strategy and channel-shuffle operation, MedMamba successfully provides fewer model parameters and a lower computational burden for efficient applications without sacrificing accuracy. We thoroughly evaluated MedMamba using 16 datasets containing ten imaging modalities and 411,007 images. Experimental results show that MedMamba demonstrates competitive performance on most tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This work aims to explore the potential of Vision Mamba and establish a new baseline for medical image classification, thereby providing valuable insights for developing more powerful Mamba-based artificial intelligence algorithms and applications in medicine. The source codes and all pre-trained weights of MedMamba are available at https://github.com/YubiaoYue/MedMamba.</description>

      <title>RSTAR4D: Rotational Streak Artifact Reduction in 4D CBCT using a Separable 4D CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT) provides respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy. However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases, the cone-beam projections become much sparser and the reconstructed 4D CBCT images will be covered by severe streak artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, most algorithms employ 2D network models as backbones, neglecting the intrinsic structural priors within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images. We find that streak artifacts exhibit a unique rotational motion along with the patient's respiration, distinguishable from diaphragm-driven respiratory motion in the spatiotemporal domain. Therefore, we propose a novel 4D neural network model, RSTAR4D-Net, designed to address Rotational STreak Artifact Reduction by integrating the spatial and temporal information within 4D CBCT images. Specifically, we overcome the computational and training difficulties of a 4D neural network. The specially designed model adopts an efficient implementation of 4D convolutions to reduce computational costs and thus can process the whole 4D image in one pass. Additionally, a Tetris training strategy pertinent to the separable 4D convolutions is proposed to effectively train the model using limited 4D training samples. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the RSTAR4D-Net shows superior performance compared to other methods. The source code and dynamic demos are available at https://github.com/ivy9092111111/RSTAR.</description>

      <title>MAMOC: MRI Motion Correction via Masked Autoencoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans poses a significant challenge, where even minor patient movements can lead to artifacts that may compromise the scan's utility.This paper introduces MAsked MOtion Correction (MAMOC), a novel method designed to address the issue of Retrospective Artifact Correction (RAC) in motion-affected MRI brain scans. MAMOC uses masked autoencoding self-supervision, transfer learning and test-time prediction to efficiently remove motion artifacts, producing high-fidelity, native-resolution scans. Until recently, realistic, openly available paired artifact presentations for training and evaluating retrospective motion correction methods did not exist, making it necessary to simulate motion artifacts. Leveraging the MR-ART dataset and bigger unlabeled datasets (ADNI, OASIS-3, IXI), this work is the first to evaluate motion correction in MRI scans using real motion data on a public dataset, showing that MAMOC achieves improved performance over existing motion correction methods.</description>

Abstract: The incidence and mortality rates of malignant tumors, such as acute leukemia, have risen significantly. Clinically, hospitals rely on cytological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears to diagnose malignant tumors, with accurate blood cell counting being crucial. Existing automated methods face challenges such as low feature expression capability, poor interpretability, and redundant feature extraction when processing high-dimensional microimage data. We propose a novel fine-grained classification model, SCKansformer, for bone marrow blood cells, which addresses these challenges and enhances classification accuracy and efficiency. The model integrates the Kansformer Encoder, SCConv Encoder, and Global-Local Attention Encoder. The Kansformer Encoder replaces the traditional MLP layer with the KAN, improving nonlinear feature representation and interpretability. The SCConv Encoder, with its Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Units, enhances feature representation and reduces redundancy. The Global-Local Attention Encoder combines Multi-head Self-Attention with a Local Part module to capture both global and local features. We validated our model using the Bone Marrow Blood Cell Fine-Grained Classification Dataset (BMCD-FGCD), comprising over 10,000 samples and nearly 40 classifications, developed with a partner hospital. Comparative experiments on our private dataset, as well as the publicly available PBC and ALL-IDB datasets, demonstrate that SCKansformer outperforms both typical and advanced microcell classification methods across all datasets. Our source code and private BMCD-FGCD dataset are available at https://github.com/JustlfC03/SCKansformer.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the question, "Can we generate tumors with desired attributes?'' this study leverages radiomics features to explore the feasibility of generating synthetic tumor images. Characterized by its low-dimensional yet biologically meaningful markers, radiomics bridges the gap between complex medical imaging data and actionable clinical insights. We present RadiomicsFill-Mammo, the first of the RadiomicsFill series, an innovative technique that generates realistic mammogram mass images mirroring specific radiomics attributes using masked images and opposite breast images, leveraging a recent stable diffusion model. This approach also allows for the incorporation of essential clinical variables, such as BI-RADS and breast density, alongside radiomics features as conditions for mass generation. Results indicate that RadiomicsFill-Mammo effectively generates diverse and realistic tumor images based on various radiomics conditions. Results also demonstrate a significant improvement in mass detection capabilities, leveraging RadiomicsFill-Mammo as a strategy to generate simulated samples. Furthermore, RadiomicsFill-Mammo not only advances medical imaging research but also opens new avenues for enhancing treatment planning and tumor simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/nainye/RadiomicsFill.</description>

      <title>GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are capable of handling diverse data types such as imaging, text, and physiological signals, and can be applied in various fields. In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 284 datasets across 38 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 53.96%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Medical Image Registration: Magic or Mirage?</title>

Abstract: Classical optimization and learning-based methods are the two reigning paradigms in deformable image registration. While optimization-based methods boast generalizability across modalities and robust performance, learning-based methods promise peak performance, incorporating weak supervision and amortized optimization. However, the exact conditions for either paradigm to perform well over the other are shrouded and not explicitly outlined in the existing literature. In this paper, we make an explicit correspondence between the mutual information of the distribution of per-pixel intensity and labels, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that architectural designs in learning-based methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of learning-based methods. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art classical and learning-based methods. However, learning-based methods with weak supervision can perform high-fidelity intensity and label registration, which is not possible with classical methods. Next, we show that this high-fidelity feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and learning-based methods are sensitive to such changes in the data distribution. Finally, we propose a general recipe to choose the best paradigm for a given registration problem, based on these observations.</description>

      <title>MicroSSIM: Improved Structural Similarity for Comparing Microscopy Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopy is routinely used to image biological structures of interest. Due to imaging constraints, acquired images, also called as micrographs, are typically low-SNR and contain noise. Over the last few years, regression-based tasks like unsupervised denoising and splitting have found utility in working with such noisy micrographs. For evaluation, Structural Similarity (SSIM) is one of the most popular measures used in the field. For such tasks, the best evaluation would be when both low-SNR noisy images and corresponding high-SNR clean images are obtained directly from a microscope. However, due to the following three peculiar properties of the microscopy data, we observe that SSIM is not well suited to this data regime: (a) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels as compared to low-SNR micrographs, (b) high-SNR micrographs have higher intensity pixels than found in natural images, images for which SSIM was developed, and (c) a digitally configurable offset is added by the detector present inside the microscope which affects the SSIM value. We show that SSIM components behave unexpectedly when the prediction generated from low-SNR input is compared with the corresponding high-SNR data. We explain this by introducing the phenomenon of saturation, where SSIM components become less sensitive to (dis)similarity between the images. We propose an intuitive way to quantify this, which explains the observed SSIM behavior. We introduce MicroSSIM, a variant of SSIM, which overcomes the above-discussed issues. We justify the soundness and utility of MicroSSIM using theoretical and empirical arguments and show the utility of MicroSSIM on two tasks: unsupervised denoising and joint image splitting with unsupervised denoising. Since our formulation can be applied to a broad family of SSIM-based measures, we also introduce MicroMS3IM, a microscopy-specific variation of MS-SSIM.</description>

Abstract: The rapid increase of computed tomography (CT) scans and their time-consuming manual analysis have created an urgent need for robust automated analysis techniques in clinical settings. These aim to assist radiologists and help them managing their growing workload. Existing methods typically generate entire reports directly from 3D CT images, without explicitly focusing on observed abnormalities. This unguided approach often results in repetitive content or incomplete reports, failing to prioritize anomaly-specific descriptions. We propose a new anomaly-guided report generation model, which first predicts abnormalities and then generates targeted descriptions for each. Evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates significant improvements in report quality and clinical relevance. We extend our work by conducting an ablation study to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in tumor segmentation within the field of digital pathology. However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

      <title>Large Scale Masked Autoencoding for Reducing Label Requirements on SAR Data</title>

Abstract: Satellite-based remote sensing is instrumental in the monitoring and mitigation of the effects of anthropogenic climate change. Large scale, high resolution data derived from these sensors can be used to inform intervention and policy decision making, but the timeliness and accuracy of these interventions is limited by use of optical data, which cannot operate at night and is affected by adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers a robust alternative to optical data, but its associated complexities limit the scope of labelled data generation for traditional deep learning. In this work, we apply a self-supervised pretraining scheme, masked autoencoding, to SAR amplitude data covering 8.7\% of the Earth's land surface area, and tune the pretrained weights on two downstream tasks crucial to monitoring climate change - vegetation cover prediction and land cover classification. We show that the use of this pretraining scheme reduces labelling requirements for the downstream tasks by more than an order of magnitude, and that this pretraining generalises geographically, with the performance gain increasing when tuned downstream on regions outside the pretraining set. Our findings significantly advance climate change mitigation by facilitating the development of task and region-specific SAR models, allowing local communities and organizations to deploy tailored solutions for rapid, accurate monitoring of climate change effects.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel linear model tailored for semisupervised/library-based unmixing. Our model incorporates considerations for library mismatch while enabling the enforcement of the abundance sum-to-one constraint (ASC). Unlike conventional sparse unmixing methods, this model involves nonconvex optimization, presenting significant computational challenges. We demonstrate the efficacy of Alternating Methods of Multipliers (ADMM) in cyclically solving these intricate problems. We propose two semisupervised unmixing approaches, each relying on distinct priors applied to the new model in addition to the ASC: sparsity prior and convexity constraint. Our experimental results validate that enforcing the convexity constraint outperforms the sparsity prior for the endmember library. These results are corroborated across three simulated datasets (accounting for spectral variability and varying pixel purity levels) and the Cuprite dataset. Additionally, our comparison with conventional sparse unmixing methods showcases considerable advantages of our proposed model, which entails nonconvex optimization. Notably, our implementations of the proposed algorithms-fast semisupervised unmixing (FaSUn) and sparse unmixing using soft-shrinkage (SUnS)-prove considerably more efficient than traditional sparse unmixing methods. SUnS and FaSUn were implemented using PyTorch and provided in a dedicated Python package called Fast Semisupervised Unmixing (FUnmix), which is open-source and available at https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/FUnmix</description>

      <title>A Momentum Accelerated Algorithm for ReLU-based Nonlinear Matrix Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in the exploration of Nonlinear Matrix Decomposition (NMD) due to its close ties with neural networks. NMD aims to find a low-rank matrix from a sparse nonnegative matrix with a per-element nonlinear function. A typical choice is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. To address over-fitting in the existing ReLU-based NMD model (ReLU-NMD), we propose a Tikhonov regularized ReLU-NMD model, referred to as ReLU-NMD-T. Subsequently, we introduce a momentum accelerated algorithm for handling the ReLU-NMD-T model. A distinctive feature, setting our work apart from most existing studies, is the incorporation of both positive and negative momentum parameters in our algorithm. Our numerical experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Moreover, the code is available at https://github.com/nothing2wang/NMD-TM.</description>

      <title>Reflectivity Is All You Need!: Advancing LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation frameworks predominantly use geometry-based features to differentiate objects within a scan. Although these methods excel in scenarios with clear boundaries and distinct shapes, their performance declines in environments where boundaries are indistinct, particularly in off-road contexts. To address this issue, recent advances in 3D segmentation algorithms have aimed to leverage raw LiDAR intensity readings to improve prediction precision. However, despite these advances, existing learning-based models face challenges in linking the complex interactions between raw intensity and variables such as distance, incidence angle, material reflectivity, and atmospheric conditions. Building upon our previous work, this paper explores the advantages of employing calibrated intensity (also referred to as reflectivity) within learning-based LiDAR semantic segmentation frameworks. We start by demonstrating that adding reflectivity as input enhances the LiDAR semantic segmentation model by providing a better data representation. Extensive experimentation with the Rellis-3d off-road dataset shows that replacing intensity with reflectivity results in a 4\% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for off-road scenarios. We demonstrate the potential benefits of using calibrated intensity for semantic segmentation in urban environments (SemanticKITTI) and for cross-sensor domain adaptation. Additionally, we tested the Segment Anything Model (SAM) using reflectivity as input, resulting in improved segmentation masks for LiDAR images.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers for End-to-End Vision-Based Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed vision-based quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional model-based approaches to navigation via independent perception, mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to have great potential for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all tested flight speeds. We assess performance at speeds of up to 7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.</description>
