      <title>Chemical evolution of an evaporating lava pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many known rocky exoplanets are so highly irradiated that their dayside surfaces are molten, and `silicate atmospheres', composed of rock-forming elements, are generated above these lava pools. The compositions of these `lava planet' atmospheres are of great interest because they must be linked to the composition of the underlying rocky interiors. It may be possible to investigate these atmospheres, either by detecting them directly via emission spectroscopy or by observing the dust tails which trail the low mass `catastrophically evaporating planets'. In this work, we develop a simple chemical model of the lava pool--atmosphere system under mass loss, to study its evolution. Mass loss can occur both into space and from the day to the nightside. We show that the system reaches a steady state, where the material in the escaping atmosphere has the same composition as that melted into the lava pool from the mantle. We show that the catastrophically evaporating planets are likely to be in this evolved state. This means that the composition of their dust tails is likely to be a direct trace of the composition of the mantle material that is melted into the lava pool. We further show that, due to the strength of day-to-nightside atmospheric transport, this evolved state may even apply to relatively high-mass planets (&gt;1 Earth Mass). Moreover, the low pressure of evolved atmospheres implies that non-detections may not be due to the total lack of an atmosphere. Both conclusions are important for the interpretation of future observations.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Spectroscopy for Planetary Sciences: A Characterization of Planetary Materials in the Mid-IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding of the formation and evolution of the Solar System requires understanding key and common materials found on and in planetary bodies. Mineral mixing and its implications on planetary body formation is a topic of high interest to the planetary science community. Previous work establishes a case for the use of Optical PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) in planetary science and introduces and demonstrates the technique's capability to study planetary materials. In this paper, we performed a measurement campaign on granular materials relevant to planetary science, such as minerals found in lunar and martian soils. These laboratory measurements serve to start a database of O-PTIR measurements. We also present FTIR absorption measurements of the materials we observed in O-PTIR for comparison purposes. We find that the O-PTIR technique suffers from granular orientation effects similar to other IR techniques, but in most cases, is is directly comparable to commonly used absorption spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that O-PTIR would be an excellent tool for the purpose of planetary material identification during in-situ investigations on regolith and bedrock surfaces.</description>

      <title>Collisional damping in debris discs: Only significant if collision velocities are low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dusty debris discs around main sequence stars are observed to vary widely in terms of their vertical thickness. Their vertical structure may be affected by damping in inelastic collisions. Although kinetic models have often been used to study the collisional evolution of debris discs, these models have not yet been used to study the evolution of their vertical structure. Aims. We extend an existing implementation of a kinetic model of collisional evolution to include the evolution of orbital inclinations and we use this model to study the effects of collisional damping in pre-stirred discs. Methods. We evolved the number of particles of different masses, eccentricities, and inclinations using the kinetic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to calculate collision rates between particles in the disc. We considered all relevant collisional outcomes including fragmentation, cratering, and growth. Results. Collisional damping is inefficient if particles can be destroyed by projectiles that are of much lower mass. If that is the case, catastrophic disruptions shape the distributions of eccentricities and inclinations, and their average values evolve slowly and at the same rate for all particle sizes. Conclusions. The critical projectile-to-target mass ratio (Yc) and the collisional timescale jointly determine the level of collisional damping in debris discs. If Yc is much smaller than unity, a debris disc retains the inclination distribution that it is born with for much longer than the collisional timescale of the largest bodies in the disc. Such a disc should exhibit a vertical thickness that is independent of wavelength even in the absence of other physical processes. Collisional damping is efficient if Yc is of order unity or larger. For millimetre-sized dust grains and common material strength assumptions, this requires collision velocities of lower than ~40 m/s. Abridged</description>

      <title>Reflected-light Phase Curves with PICASO: A Kepler-7b Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the scattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future flagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced capability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations (PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code Virga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and varying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to Kepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected starlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3 clouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our Virga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected from previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern limb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2 clouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled reflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with all three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03 - 0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities approximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better understanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle scattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the modeled and observed reflected light fluxes.</description>

      <title>Observing planetary gaps in the gas of debris disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ALMA observations discovered consequent amounts (i.e., up to a few $10^{-1}\; \rm M_\oplus$) of CO gas in debris disks that were expected to be gas-free. This gas is in general estimated to be mostly composed of CO, C, and O (i.e., $\rm H_2$-poor), unlike the gas present in protoplanetary disks ($\rm H_2$-rich). At this stage, the majority of planet formation already occurred, and giant planets might be evolving in these disks. While planets have been directly observed in debris disks (e.g., $\beta$ Pictoris), their direct observations are challenging due to the weak luminosity of the planets. In this paper, with the help of hydrodynamical simulations (with FARGO3D) coupled with a radiative transfer code (RADMC-3D) and an observing tool (CASA), we show that planet-gas interactions can produce observable substructures in this late debris disk stage. While it is tricky to observe gaps in the CO emission of protoplanetary disks, the unique properties of the gaseous debris disks allow us to observe planetary gaps in the gas. Depending on the total mass of the gaseous debris disk, kinks can also be observed. We derive a simple criterion to estimate in which conditions gaps would be observable and apply it to the known gaseous debris disk surrounding HD138813. In our framework, we find that planets as small as $0.5 \; \rm M_J$ can produce observable gaps and investigate under which conditions (i.e., gas and planets characteristics) the substructure become observable with ALMA. The first observations of planet-gas interactions in debris disks can lead to a new way to indirectly detect exoplanets, reaching a population that could not be probed before, such as giant planets that are too cold to be detected by direct imaging.</description>

      <title>The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) I.: High precision stellar chemical abundance for 17 planet-hosting stars and the condensation temperature trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]$_{\rm solar}$ - [X/Fe]$_{\rm star}$) versus condensation temperature ($T_c$) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative $T_c$ trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant-planet-host stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between $T_c$ trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear internal waves breaking in stellar radiation zones. Parametrisation for the transport of angular momentum: bridging geophysical to stellar fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can play a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along their evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since space-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars, which is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar models ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular momentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they meet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been derived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their radiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along their propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered by their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and robust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and evolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been developed for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and has been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to the case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the modification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which are discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete semi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs, which takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential nonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear instabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the interactions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of realism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: This document compiles results obtained from the test campaign of the European Moon Rover System (EMRS) project. The test campaign, conducted at the Planetary Exploration Lab of DLR in Wessling, aimed to understand the scope of the EMRS breadboard design, its strengths, and the benefits of the modular design. The discussion of test results is based on rover traversal analyses, robustness assessments, wheel deflection analyses, and the overall transportation cost of the rover. This not only enables the comparison of locomotion modes on lunar regolith but also facilitates critical decision-making in the design of future lunar missions.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>

      <title>Streams and Bubbles: Tidal Shaping of Planetary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Jupiter's heating and self-shadowing on the Jovian circumplanetary disk structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deciphering the structure of the circumplanetary disk that surrounded Jupiter at the end of its formation is key to understanding how the Galilean moons formed. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations have shown that this disk was optically thick and significantly heated to very high temperatures due to the intense radiation emitted by the hot, young planet. Analyzing the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing on the structure of the circumplanetary disk can provide valuable insights into the conditions that shaped the formation of the Galilean moons. To assess the impact of Jupiter's radiative heating and shadowing, we have developed a two-dimensional quasi-stationary circumplanetary disk model and used a grey atmosphere radiative transfer method to determine the thermal structure of the disk. We find that the circumplanetary disk self-shadowing has a significant effect, with a temperature drop of approximately 100 K in the shadowed zone compared to the surrounding areas. This shadowed zone, located around 10 Jupiter radii, can act as a cold trap for volatile species such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$S. The existence of these shadows in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk may have influenced the composition of the building blocks of the Galilean moons, potentially shaping their formation and characteristics. Our study suggests that the thermal structure of Jupiter's circumplanetary disk, particularly the presence of cold traps due to self-shadowing, may have played a crucial role in the formation and composition of the Galilean moons.</description>

Abstract: The Simplified General Perturbations 4 (SGP4) orbital propagation method is widely used for predicting the positions and velocities of Earth-orbiting objects rapidly and reliably. Despite continuous refinement, SGP models still lack the precision of numerical propagators, which offer significantly smaller errors. This study presents dSGP4, a novel differentiable version of SGP4 implemented using PyTorch. By making SGP4 differentiable, dSGP4 facilitates various space-related applications, including spacecraft orbit determination, state conversion, covariance transformation, state transition matrix computation, and covariance propagation. Additionally, dSGP4's PyTorch implementation allows for embarrassingly parallel orbital propagation across batches of Two-Line Element Sets (TLEs), leveraging the computational power of CPUs, GPUs, and advanced hardware for distributed prediction of satellite positions at future times. Furthermore, dSGP4's differentiability enables integration with modern machine learning techniques. Thus, we propose a novel orbital propagation paradigm, ML-dSGP4, where neural networks are integrated into the orbital propagator. Through stochastic gradient descent, this combined model's inputs, outputs, and parameters can be iteratively refined, surpassing SGP4's precision. Neural networks act as identity operators by default, adhering to SGP4's behavior. However, dSGP4's differentiability allows fine-tuning with ephemeris data, enhancing precision while maintaining computational speed. This empowers satellite operators and researchers to train the model using specific ephemeris or high-precision numerical propagation data, significantly advancing orbital prediction capabilities.</description>
