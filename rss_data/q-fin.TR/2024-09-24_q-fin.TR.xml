      <title>Price predictability in limit order book with deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the prediction of high-frequency price changes using deep learning models. Although state-of-the-art methods perform well, their complexity impedes the understanding of successful predictions. We found that an inadequately defined target price process may render predictions meaningless by incorporating past information. The commonly used three-class problem in asset price prediction can generally be divided into volatility and directional prediction. When relying solely on the price process, directional prediction performance is not substantial. However, volume imbalance improves directional prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Crisis Alpha: A High-Performance Trading Algorithm Tested in Market Downturns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming quantitative portfolios using statistical risk models presents a significant challenge for hedge funds and portfolio managers. This research investigates three distinct statistical risk models to construct quantitative portfolios of 1,000 floating stocks in the US market. Utilizing five different investment strategies, these models are tested across four periods, encompassing the last three major financial crises: The Dot Com Bubble, Global Financial Crisis, and Covid-19 market downturn. Backtests leverage the CRSP dataset from January 1990 through December 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed models consistently outperformed market excess returns across all periods. These findings suggest that the developed risk models can serve as valuable tools for asset managers, aiding in strategic decision-making and risk management in various economic conditions.</description>

      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Stockagent.</description>
