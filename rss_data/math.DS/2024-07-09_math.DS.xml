      <title>Equidistribution of polynomially bounded o-minimal curves in homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Ratner's theorem on equidistribution of individual orbits of unipotent flows on finite volume homogeneous spaces of Lie groups to trajectories of non-contracting curves definable in polynomially bounded o-minimal structures.
  To be precise, let $\varphi:[0,\infty)\to \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ be a continuous map whose coordinate functions are definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure; for example, rational functions. Suppose that $\varphi$ is non-contracting; that is, for any linearly independent vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ in $\mathbb R^n$, $\varphi(t).(v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k)\not\to0$ as $t\to\infty$. Then, there exists a unique smallest subgroup $H_\varphi$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ generated by unipotent one-parameter subgroups such that $\varphi(t)H_\varphi\to g_0H_\varphi$ in $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)/H_\varphi$ as $t\to\infty$ for some $g_0\in \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$.
  Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ and $\Gamma$ be a lattice in $G$. Suppose that $\varphi([0,\infty))\subset G$. Then $H_\varphi\subset G$, and for any $x\in G/\Gamma$, the trajectory $\{\varphi(t)x:t\in [0,T]\}$ gets equidistributed with respect to the measure $g_0\mu_{Lx}$ as $T\to\infty$, where $L$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ such that $\overline{Hx}=Lx$ and $Lx$ admits a unique $L$-invariant probability measure, denoted by $\mu_{Lx}$.
  A crucial new ingredient in this work is proving that for any finite-dimensional representation $V$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$, there exist $T_0&gt;0$, $C&gt;0$, and $\alpha&gt;0$ such that for any $v\in G$, the map $t\mapsto \|\varphi(t)v\|$ is $(C,\alpha)$-good on $[T_0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Higuchi fractal dimension of invariant measures for countable idempotent iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the set of invariant idempotent probabilities for countable idempotent iterated function systems (IFS) defined in compact metric spaces. We demonstrate that, with constant weights, there exists a unique invariant idempotent probability. Utilizing Secelean's approach to countable IFSs, we introduce partially finite idempotent IFSs and prove that the sequence of invariant idempotent measures for these systems converges to the invariant measure of the original countable IFS. We then apply these results to approximate such measures with discrete systems, producing, in the one-dimensional case, data series whose Higuchi fractal dimension can be calculated. Finally, we provide numerical approximations for two-dimensional cases and discuss the application of generalized Higuchi dimensions in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unfolding a Hopf bifurcation in a linear reaction-diffusion equation with strongly localized impurity existence of breathing pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general framework to derive the weakly nonlinear stability near a Hopf bifurcation in a special class of multi-scale reaction-diffusion equations. The main focus is on how the linearity and nonlinearity of the fast variables in system influence the emergence of the breathing pulses when the slow variables are linear and the bifurcation parameter is around the Hopf bifurcation point. By applying the matching principle to the fast and slow changing quantities and using the relevant theory of singular perturbation, we obtain explicit expressions for the stationary pulses. Then, the normal form theory and the center manifold theory are applied to give Hopf normal form expressions. Finally, one of these expressions is verified by the numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Computation of Domains of analyticity of lower dimensional tori in a weakly dissipative Froeschl\'e map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Froeschl\'e map and we add a weak dissipation of the form $\lambda(\varepsilon) = 1- \varepsilon^3$, where $\varepsilon$ is the parameter of perturbation. We compute formal expansions of lower dimensional tori, both in the conservative and weakly dissipatives cases, and use them to estimate the shape of their domains of analyticity as functions of $\varepsilon$. Our results support conjectures in the literature.</description>

      <title>Insights on Stochastic Dynamics for Transmission of Monkeypox: Biological and Probabilistic Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of monkeypox is studied using a stochastic model taking into account the biological aspects, the contact mechanisms and the demographic factors together with the intrinsic uncertainties. Our results provide insight into the interaction between stochasticity and biological elements in the dynamics of monkeypox transmission. The rigorous mathematical analysis determines threshold parameters for disease persistence. For the proposed model, the existence of a unique global almost sure non-negative solution is proven. Conditions leading to disease extinction are established. Asymptotic properties of the model are investigated such as the speed of transmission.</description>

      <title>Structured quantitative almost reducibility and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish \textit{structured quantitative almost reducibility}, tailored for analytic quasiperiodic $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles, which effectively addresses the challenge of infinitely many \textit{normal frequency} resonances. This method paves the way for optimal arithmetic reducibility results for such cocycles, thereby resolving Jitomirskaya's conjecture. From a spectral perspective, it leads to optimal arithmetic Anderson localization for a class of quasiperiodic long-range operators on higher-dimensional lattices. In particular, using structured quantitative almost reducibility, we establish a sharp quantitative version of Aubry duality, enabling us to uncover new spectral insights for almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequencies. For example, we precisely determine the exponential decay rate of spectral gaps in non-critical cases, thus addressing a question raised by Goldstein. Additionally, we reveal the optimal asymptotic growth of extended eigenfunctions for subcritical almost Mathieu operators.</description>

      <title>Exploring localization in nonlinear oscillator systems through network-based predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized vibrations, arising from nonlinearities or symmetry breaking, pose a challenge in engineering, as the resulting high-amplitude vibrations may result in component failure due to fatigue. During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to predicting an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples. The source code for this work is available.</description>

      <title>Edge Geometry of Regular Polygons -- Part 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple mappings that can be used to generate what we call the 'edge geometry' of a regular N-gon, but they are all based on piecewise isometries acting on the extended edges of N to form a 'singularity' set W. This singularity set is also known as the 'web' because it is connected and consists of rays or line segments, with possible accumulation points in the limit. We will use three such maps here, all of which appear to share the same local geometry of W. These mappings are the outer-billiards map Tau, the digital-filter map Df and the 'dual-center' map Dc. In 'Outer-billiards, digital filters and kicked Hamiltonians' (arXiv:1206.5223) we show that the Df and Dc maps are equivalent to a 'shear and rotation' in a toral space and the complex plane respectively, and in 'First Families of Regular Polygons and their Mutations' (arXiv:1612.09295) we show that the Tau-web W can also be reduced to a shear and rotation. This equivalence of maps supports the premise that this web geometry is inherent in the N-gon. Since the topology of W is complex, we hope to make some progress by studying the region local to N. The edges of every regular N-gon are part of a Tau-invariant region local to N. The emphasis here are the S[1] and S[2] First Family tiles adjacent to N, but we will also study their interaction with neighboring tiles. Since all S[k] tiles evolve in a multi-step fashion, it is possible to make predictions about the 'next-generation' tiles which survive in the web. The Edge Conjecture defines just 8 classes of N-gons so there is an 'Eightfold Way' for regular polygons.</description>

Abstract: This paper is focused on the modified Zakharov-Kusnetsov equation. We prove the associated Cauchy problem is locally (in time) well-posed in $H^s(\R \times \T)$ for $s &gt;1$. The new ingredient in this work is a trilinear estimate in the context of Bourgain spaces which controls the cubic non-linearity of the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the contraction argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a combinatorial tool to help study some topological properties of modular knots. We construct templates for the infinitely many Anosov flows on the trefoil complement, which are lifts of the geodesic flow on the modular surface, by lifting Ghys' modular template using self-covering of the trefoil complement of order $6k+1$, for $k\in \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$. This allows to study the knot properties of closed geodesics in these flows, and an explicit construction of an infinite family of links of two components with one of them being the trefoil, all commensurable to one another.</description>

      <title>The Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture with a moving target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the inhomogeneous generalization of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture in dimension $m \geq 3$. That is, given $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that $\sum (\varphi(q)\psi(q)/q)^m = \infty$, we show that for almost every $\mathbf{x} \in\mathbb{R}^m$ there are infinitely many rational vectors $\mathbf{a}/q$ such that $\vert q\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{y}\vert&lt;\psi(q)$ and such that each component of $\mathbf{a}$ is coprime to $q$. This is an inhomogeneous extension of a homogeneous conjecture of Sprind\v{z}uk which was itself proved in 1990 by Pollington and Vaughan. In fact, our main result generalizes Pollington-Vaughan not only to the inhomogeneous case, but also to the setting of moving targets, where the inhomogeneous parameter $\mathbf{y}$ is free to vary with $q$. In contrast, we show by an explicit construction that the (1-dimensional) inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture fails to hold with a moving target, implying that any successful attack on the one-dimensional problem must use the fact that the inhomogeneous parameter is constant. We also introduce new questions regarding moving targets.</description>

      <title>Global realisation of magnetic fields as 1$\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews the notion of $n+\frac{1}{2}$D non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, portraying their dynamics as the flow of the Reeb field related to a closed two-form of maximal rank on a cosymplectic manifold, and naturally decomposing into time-like and Hamiltonian components. The paper then investigates the conditions under which the field-line dynamics of a (tangential) divergence-free vector field on a connected compact three-manifold (possibly with boundary) diffeomorphic to a trivial fibre bundle over the circle can be conversely identified as a non-autonomous $1\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian system. Under the assumption that the field is transverse to a global compact Poincar\'e section, an adaptation of Moser's trick shows that all such fields are locally-Hamiltonian. A full identification is established upon further assuming that the Poincar\'e sections are planar, which crucially implies (together with Dirichlet boundary conditions) that the cohomology class of the generating closed one-forms on each section is constant. By reviewing the classification of fibre bundles over the circle using the monodromy representation, it is remarked that as soon as the Poincar\'e section of an alleged field is diffeomorphic to a disk or an annulus, the domain is necessarily diffeomorphic to a solid or hollow torus, and thus its field-line dynamics can always be identified as a non-autonomous Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>Data-driven input-to-state stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the class of nonlinear input-affine systems with polynomial dynamics, we consider the problem of designing an input-to-state stabilizing controller with respect to typical exogenous signals in a feedback control system, such as actuator and process disturbances. We address this problem in a data-based setting when we cannot avail ourselves of the dynamics of the actual system, but only of data generated by it under unknown bounded noise. For all dynamics consistent with data, we derive sum-of-squares programs to design an input-to-state stabilizing controller, an input-to-state Lyapunov function and the corresponding comparison functions. This numerical design for input-to-state stabilization seems to be relevant not only in the considered data-based setting, but also in a model-based setting. Illustration of feasibility of the provided sum-of-squares programs is provided on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Symmetric relative equilibria with one dominant and four infinitesimal point vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.08437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the symmetry of point vortices with one dominant vortex and four vortices with infinitesimal circulations in the (1+4)-vortex problem, a subcase of the five-vortex problem. The four infinitesimal vortices inscribe quadrilaterals in the unit circle with the dominant vortex at the origin. We consider symmetric configurations which have one degree of spacial freedom, namely the (1+N)-gon, kites, rectangles, and trapezoids with three equal sides. We show there is only one possible rectangular configuration (up to rotation and ordering of the vortices) and one possible trapezoid with three equal sides (up to rotation and ordering), while there are parametrically defined families of kites. Additionally we consider the (1+4)-gon and show that the infinitesimal vortices must have equal circulations on opposite corners of the square. The proofs are heavily dependent on techniques from algebraic geometry and require the use of a computer to calculate Grobner bases.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of ergodic averages and other stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ergodic map $T$ and a non-constant, real-valued $f \in L^1$, the ergodic averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x) = \frac{1} {N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(T^n x)$ converge a.e., but the convergence is never monotone. Depending on particular properties of the function $f$, the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ may or may not actually fluctuate around the mean value infinitely often a.e. We will prove that a.e. fluctuation around the mean is the generic behavior. That is, for a fixed ergodic $T$, the generic non-constant $f\in L^1$ has the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ fluctuating around the mean infinitely often for almost every $x$. We also consider fluctuation for other stochastic processes like subsequences of the ergodic averages, convolution operators, weighted averages, uniform distribution and martingales. We will show that in general, in these settings fluctuation around the limit infinitely often persists as the generic behavior.</description>

      <title>On the critical regularity of nilpotent groups acting on the interval: the metabelian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a torsion-free, finitely-generated, nilpotent and metabelian group. In this work we show that $G$ embeds into the group of orientation preserving $C^{1+\alpha}$-diffeomorphisms of the compact interval, for all $\alpha&lt; 1/k$ where $k$ is the torsion-free rank of $G/A$ and $A$ is a maximal abelian subgroup. We show that in many situations the corresponding $1/k$ is critical in the sense that there is no embedding of $G$ with higher regularity. A particularly nice family where this happens, is the family of $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg groups, for which we can show that the critical regularity equals $1+1/n$.</description>

      <title>Identifiable specializations for ODE models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parameter identifiability problem for a dynamical system is to determine whether the parameters of the system can be found from data for the outputs of the system. Verifying whether the parameters are identifiable is a necessary first step before a meaningful parameter estimation can take place. Non-identifiability occurs in practical models. To reparametrize a model to achieve identifiability is a challenge. The existing approaches have been shown to be useful for many important examples. However, these approaches are either limited to linear models and scaling parametrizations or are not guaranteed to find a reparametrization even if it exists. In the present paper, we prove that there always exists a locally identifiable model with the same input-output behaviour as the original one obtained from a given one by a partial specialization of the parameters. As an extra feature of our approach, the resulting (at least) locally identifiable reparameterization has the same shape: the monomials in the new state variables in the new model are formed in the same way as in the original model. Furthermore, we give a sufficient observability condition for the existence of a state space transformation from the original model to the new one. Our proof is constructive and can be translated to an algorithm, which we illustrate by several examples.</description>

      <title>Decrypting Nonlinearity: Koopman Interpretation and Analysis of Cryptosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy. Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data samples of the cryptosystems.</description>

      <title>On discrete Routh reduction and structures on the reduced space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we work, first, with forced discrete-time mechanical systems on the configuration space $Q$ and construct closed $2$-forms $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ on $Q \times Q$, that are symplectic if and only if the system is regular. For a special type of discrete force, we prove that $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ are invariant by the flow of the system. We also consider the Lagrangian reduction of a discrete mechanical system by a symmetry group (using an affine discrete connection derived from the discrete momentum) and prove that, under some conditions on the action, the trajectories of the reduced system (with constant discrete momentum $\mu$) can be seen as trajectories of a forced discrete mechanical system, where the discrete force is of the type analyzed before. Therefore, we prove that there is a symplectic structure that is invariant by the flow of the forced reduced system; the symplectic structure can be seen as a pullback of a canonical cotangent structure plus a magnetic term. This discrete reduction process is the (discrete) Routh reduction and the behavior obtained runs parallel to the well known case for (continuous) Routh reduction.</description>

      <title>Minimal model program for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties, we prove the base-point-freeness theorem, the contraction theorem, and the existence of flips. The first result resolves a conjecture of Cascini and Spicer, while the latter two results strengthen a result of Cascini and Spicer by removing their assumption on the termination of flips.
  Moreover, we prove the existence of the minimal model program for lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties and the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces for lc algebraically integrable foliations polarized with ample divisors on klt varieties. As a consequence, we show that $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt varieties with lc algebraically integrable Fano foliation structures are Mori dream spaces. We also show the existence of a Shokurov-type polytope for lc algebraically integrable foliations.</description>
