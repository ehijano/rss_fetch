      <title>On the Nature of Nonthermal Broadening of Spectral Lines Observed by IRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of nonthermal broadening in solar spectra is one of the long-standing questions in solar physics. Various processes have been invoked - including unresolved flows, waves, and turbulent processes - but definitive answers are lacking. To investigate the physical processes responsible for nonthermal broadening, we examine its relation with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in three different closed-field regions above plage regions at different locations on the solar disk. We obtained the nonthermal width of transition-region Si IV 1403 {\AA} spectra observed in active regions by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, after subtraction of the thermal and instrumental line broadening. To investigate the dependence of the measured broadening on the viewing angle between the line of sight and magnetic field direction, we determined the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights using nonlinear force-free extrapolations based on the observed photospheric vector magnetic field taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found that the nonthermal broadening shows a correlation with downward motion (redshifts)and alignment between the magnetic field and the observer's line-of-sight direction. Based on the observed correlations, we suggest that velocity gradients within plasma flowing down along the magnetic field may lead to a significant portion of the observed nonthermal broadening of transition-region spectral lines in closed fields above plage regions.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight: Searching for Dark Companions to Bright Stars with the Large Binocular Telescope and SHARK-VIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results from a pilot study to search for black holes and other dark companions in binary systems using direct imaging with SHARK-VIS and the iLocater pathfinder "Lili" on the Large Binocular Telescope. Starting from known single-lined spectroscopic binaries, we select systems with high mass functions that could host dark companions and whose spectroscopic orbits indicate a projected orbital separation $\geq 30$ mas. For this first exploration, we selected four systems (HD 137909, HD 104438, HD 117044, and HD 176695). In each case, we identify a luminous companion and measure the flux ratio and angular separation. However, two of the systems (HD 104438 and HD 176695) are not consistent with simple binary systems and are most likely hierarchical triples. The observed companions rule out a massive compact object for HD 137909, HD 117044, and HD 176695. HD 104438 requires further study because the identified star cannot be responsible for the RV orbit and is likely a dwarf tertiary companion. The SHARK-VIS observation was taken near pericenter, and a second image near apocenter is needed to discriminate between a closely separated luminous secondary and a compact object. We show how the combination of RVs and direct imaging can be used to constrain the orbital inclination and companion mass, and discuss the potential of high resolution direct imaging surveys to identify and confirm non-interacting compact object candidates.</description>

      <title>OGLE-BLAP-001 and ZGP-BLAP-08: two possible magnetic blue large-amplitude pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a newly discovered group of compact pulsating stars whose origin needs to be explained. Of the existing evolutionary scenarios that could lead to the formation of BLAPs, there are two in which BLAPs are the products of the merger of two stars, either a main sequence star and a helium white dwarf or two low-mass helium white dwarfs. Among over a hundred known BLAPs, three equidistant in frequency modes had been found in one, OGLE-BLAP-001. We show that similar three equidistant in frequency modes exist in yet another BLAP, ZGP-BLAP-08. This perfect separation in frequency is a strong argument to explain the modes in terms of an oblique pulsator model. This model is supported by the character of the changes of the pulsation amplitude and phase with the rotational phase. Consequently, we hypothesize that these two BLAPs are magnetic, as equidistant in frequency pulsation modes should be observed in the presence of a magnetic field whose axis of symmetry does not coincide with the rotation axis. A logical consequence of this hypothesis is to postulate that these two BLAPs could have originated in a merger scenario, just how the origin of magnetic white dwarfs is explained. We also find that period changes in both stars cannot be interpreted by a constant rate of period change and discuss the possible origin of these changes.</description>

      <title>BRITE nascent binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nascent binaries (NBs) are binary systems with very low mass ratios, less than ~0.2, in which the more massive component is an O- or B-type main-sequence star, while the secondary is a star contracting onto the main sequence. NBs are of interest because they can help to understand the formation of small-mass ratio systems and shed light on the origin of low-mass X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars and type Ia supernovae. In photometry, short-period NBs show a strong irradiation effect due to the large difference between the effective temperatures of the components and the strong irradiation of a cool secondary by a hot primary. In spectroscopy, they usually appear as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. In the present paper, we summarize the status of our knowledge of Galactic nascent binaries and characterize two new members of this group, c2 Sco and V390 Pup, for which photometric data were obtained by the BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) nano-satellite mission.</description>

      <title>Presolar Grains As Probes of Supernova Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the isotopic signatures of presolar supernova grains, specifically focusing on 44Ti-containing grains with robustly inferred supernova origins and their implications for nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanisms in supernovae. Recent technique advancements have enabled the differentiation between radiogenic (from 44Ti decay) and nonradiogenic 44Ca excesses in presolar grains, made possible by enhanced spatial resolution of Ca-Ti isotope analyses with the Cameca NanoSIMS (Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. Within the context of presolar supernova grain data, we discuss (i) the production of 44Ti in supernovae and the impact of interstellar medium heterogeneities on the galactic chemical evolution of 44Ca/40Ca, (ii) the nucleosynthesis processes of neutron bursts and explosive H-burning in Type II supernovae, and (iii) challenges in identifying the progenitor supernovae for 54Cr-rich presolar nanospinel grains. Drawing on constraints and insights derived from presolar supernova grain data, we also provide an overview of our current understanding of the roles played by various supernova types - including Type II, Type Ia, and electron capture supernovae - in accounting for the diverse array of nucleosynthetic isotopic variations identified in bulk meteorites and meteoritic components. We briefly overview the potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain these nucleosynthetic variations by describing the transport and distribution of presolar dust carriers in the protoplanetary disk. We highlight existing controversies in the interpretation of presolar grain data and meteoritic nucleosynthetic isotopic variations, while also outlining potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Magnetic massive stars: confirming the merger scenario for the magnetic field generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are considered to be key components of massive stars, with a far-reaching impact on their evolution and ultimate fate. A magnetic mechanism was suggested for the collimated explosion of massive stars, relevant for long-duration gamma-ray bursts, X-ray flashes, and asymmetric core collapse supernovae. However, the origin of the observed stable, globally organized magnetic fields in massive stars is still a matter of debate: it has been argued that they can be fossil, dynamo generated, or generated by strong binary interactions or merging events. Taking into account that multiplicity is a fundamental characteristic of massive stars, observational evidence is accumulating that the magnetism originates through interaction between the system components, both during the initial mass transfer or when the stellar cores merge.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of solar activity on the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) data collected over 10 years. We report the observation of Solar Radio Burst signals in AERA data associated with intense solar flares accompanied by moderate and strong radio blackout levels recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, although in a frequency range different from AERA, the increased level of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation during periods of larger solar activity also impacts the AERA data in a twofold way: (i) causing the atmosphere to bounce terrestrial radio waves emitted by sources far from the AERA site or (ii) causing radio signals to become degraded or completely absorbed (radio blackout) if the solar radiation results in larger ionization of the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere, respectively. We describe the identification of both cases in AERA data with a remarkable correlation between the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), that represents the highest frequency that can be used for radio communication between two points located on the Earth, modulated by the solar cycle, and the broadband noise observed in the frequency range of 30-40 MHz.</description>

      <title>Composition variation of the May 16 2023 Solar Energetic Particle Event observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the combined charged particle measurements from Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO) to study the composition variation of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event occurring on May 16, 2023. During the event, SolO and PSP were located at a similar radial distance of ~0.7 au and were separated by $\sim$60$^\circ$ in longitude. The footpoints of both PSP and SolO were west of the flare region but the former was much closer (18$^\circ$ vs 80$^\circ$). Such a distribution of observers is ideal for studying the longitudinal dependence of the ion composition with the minimum transport effects of particles along the radial direction. We focus on H, He, O, and Fe measured by both spacecraft in sunward and anti-sunward directions. Their spectra are in a double power-law shape, which is fitted best by the Band function. Notably, the event was Fe-rich at PSP, where the mean Fe/O ratio at energies of 0.1 - 10 Mev/nuc was 0.48, higher than the average Fe/O ratio in previous large SEP events. In contrast, the mean Fe/O ratio at SolO over the same energy range was considerable lower at 0.08. The Fe/O ratio between 0.5 and 10 MeV/nuc at both spacecraft is nearly constant. Although the He/H ratio shows energy dependence, decreasing with increasing energy, the He/H ratio at PSP is still about twice as high as that at SolO. Such a strong longitudinal dependence of element abundances and the Fe-rich component in the PSP data could be attributed to the direct flare contribution. Moreover, the temporal profiles indicate that differences in the Fe/O and He/H ratios between PSP and SolO persisted throughout the entire event rather than only at the start.</description>

      <title>A catalog of binary stars from phase modulation in the first four years of TESS Mission photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of binary companions to $\delta$ Scuti stars, detected through phase modulations of their pulsations in TESS data. Pulsation timing has provided orbits for hundreds of pulsating stars in binaries from space-based photometry. We have applied this technique to $\delta$ Sct stars observed in the first four years of TESS Mission photometry. We searched the 2-min cadence light curves of 1161 short-period instability strip pulsators for variations in pulsation phase caused by the dynamical influence of an unseen companion. We discovered 53 new binaries and we present orbital parameters and mass functions for the 24 systems with solvable orbits. For the brightest star in our sample $\alpha$ Pictoris, we perform a joint fit of the pulsation timing and Hipparcos astrometry. We present the first orbit for the $\alpha$ Pictoris system, obtaining an orbital period of 1316$\pm$2 days and a mass for $\alpha$ Pic b of 1.05$\pm$0.05 M$_\odot$. We revisit pulsation timing binaries from Kepler with Gaia kinematics, finding four systems that are members of the Galatic thick disk or halo. This suggests that they have been rejuvenated by mass transfer, and their companions are now white dwarfs. Further follow up of these systems may yield valuable constraints of the galactic blue straggler population.</description>

      <title>Analytic insight into the physics of SASI I. Shock instability in a non-rotating stellar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the core collapse of a massive star just before its supernova explosion, the amplification of asymmetric motions by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) imprints on the neutrino flux and the gravitational waves a frequency signature carrying direct information on the explosion process. The physical interpretation of this multi-messenger signature requires a detailed understanding of the instability mechanism. A perturbative analysis is used to characterize the properties of SASI, and assess the effect of the region of neutronization above the surface of the proto-neutron star. The eigenfrequencies of the most unstable modes are compared to those obtained in an adiabatic approximation where neutrino interactions are neglected above the neutrinosphere. The differential system is solved analytically using a Wronskian method and approximated asymptotically for a large shock radius. The oscillation period of SASI is well fitted with a simple analytic function of the shock radius, the radius of maximum deceleration and the mass of the proto-neutron star. The oscillation period is weakly dependent on the parametrized cooling function which however affects the SASI growth rate. The general properties of SASI eigenmodes are described using an adiabatic model. In this approximation the eigenvalue problem is formulated as a self-forced oscillator. The forcing agent is the radial advection of baroclinic vorticity perturbations and entropy perturbations produced by the shock oscillation. The differential system defining the eigenfrequencies is reduced to a single integral equation. Its analytical approximation sheds light on the radially extended character of the region of advective-acoustic coupling. The simplicity of this adiabatic formalism opens new perspectives to investigate the effect of stellar rotation and non-adiabatic processes on SASI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the new discoveries enabled thanks to the recent space missions, stellar physics is going through a revolution. However, these discoveries opened the door to many new questions that require more observations. The European Space Agency's Human and Robotic Exploration programme provides an excellent opportunity to push forward the limits of our knowledge and better understand stellar structure and dynamics evolution. Long-term observations, Ultra-Violet observations, and a stellar imager are a few highlights of proposed missions for late-type stars that will enhance the already planned space missions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Helical Plasma Turbulence on the Diffusive $\beta$ Effect with Increasing Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for plasma systems with increasing Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. For $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, we used large-scale magnetic data. Additionally, we calculated $\beta$theo using turbulent kinetic data. We reproduced large-scale magnetic fields, B, for each case and compared them with the simulation data. The results show that the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and B in each case are consistent with other approaches, particularly simulation results, as long as the nonlinear effects are not too strong. This indicates that magnetic effects need to be incorporated when nonlinearity becomes significant. Nonetheless, the consistent results between B and turbulent plasma motion suggest a theoretically sound approach. On the other hand, to explain the physical meanings of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduced a field structure model. Although simple, this model effectively clarifies the roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, representing the electrodynamic induction effect and the fluid-like diffusion effect, respectively. The agreement between our method and direct numerical simulations, along with the physical interpretations, indicates that the complex interaction processes between turbulent plasma and magnetic fields can be analyzed using fundamental and conservative physical quantities. Furthermore, $\alpha$semi and $\beta$semi, which successfully reproduce the numerically calculated magnetic field, can serve as benchmarks for more rigorous theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure properties and weak interaction rates of even-even Fe isotopes</title>

Abstract: Nuclear structure properties and weak interaction rates of neutron rich even even iron (Fe) isotopes (A = 50 70) are investigated using the Interacting Boson Model1 (IBM1) and the proton neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pnQRPA) model. The IBM1 is used for the calculation of energy levels and the B(E2) values of neutron rich Fe isotopes. Later their geometry was predicted within the potential energy formalism of the IBM1 model. Weak interaction rates on neutron rich nuclei are needed for the modeling and simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars. In the current study, we investigate the possible effect of nuclear deformation on stellar rates of even even Fe isotopes. The pnQRPA model is applied to calculate the weak interaction rates of selected Fe isotopes using three different values of deformation parameter. It is noted that, in general, bigger deformation values led to smaller total strength and larger centroid values of the resulting Gamow Teller distributions. This later translated to smaller computed weak interaction rates. The current finding warrants further investigation before it may be generalized.The reported stellar rates are up to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than previous calculations and may bear astrophysical significance.</description>

      <title>The LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of Supergiants in M31 and M33</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present systematic identifications of supergiants of M31/M33 based on massive LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Radial velocities of nearly 5000 photometrically selected M31/M33 supergiant candidates have been properly derived from the qualified spectra released in LAMOST DR10. By comparing their radial velocities with those predicted from the rotation curves of M31, as well as utilizing {\it Gaia} astrometric measurements to exclude foreground contaminations, 199 supergiant members in M31, including 168 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2', have been successfully identified. This sample contains 62 blue supergiants (BSGs, all `Rank1'), 134 yellow supergiants (YSGs, 103 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2') and 3 red supergiants (RSGs, all `Rank1'). For M33, we identify 84 supergiant members (56 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2'), which includes 28 BSGs (all `Rank1'), 53 YSGs (25 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2') and 3 RSGs (all `Rank1'). So far, this is one of the largest supergiant sample of M31/M33 with full optical wavelength coverage (3700 \textless $\lambda$ \textless 9100 \AA). This sample is valuable for understanding the star formation and stellar evolution under different environments.</description>

      <title>Combining REBOUND and MESA: Dynamical Evolution of Planets Orbiting Interacting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although planets have been found orbiting binary systems, whether they can survive binary interactions is debated. While the tightest-orbit binaries should host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary systems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass transfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we explore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly integrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA into the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a comprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets orbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the detailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration method to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during the system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in which a $2.21\, M_\odot$ star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through non-conservative mass transfer to the $1.76\, M_\odot$ companion star, creating a $0.38\,M_\odot$ subdwarf. We find the tightest stable orbital separation for circumbinary planets to be $\simeq 2.5$ times the binary separation after mass transfer. Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find that tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and start to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our research provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in interacting binary systems.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. T\.ZOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for T\.ZO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not T\.ZOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of T\.ZOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of T\.ZOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of T\.ZO theory to recent progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Blue straggler stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Formation of Fast-spinning Neutron Stars in Close Binaries and Magnetar-driven Stripped-envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), broad-line Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), are widely believed to harbor a newborn fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (``magnetar''), which can lose its rotational energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable angular momentum (AM) in the cores of massive stars to finally produce such fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate. Popular proposed scenarios in the literature cannot simultaneously explain their event rate density, SN and magnetar parameters, and the observed metallicity. Here, we perform a detailed binary evolution simulation that demonstrates that tidal spin-up helium stars with efficient AM transport mechanism in close binaries can form fast-spinning magnetars at the end of stars' life to naturally reproduce the universal energy-mass correlation of these magnetar-driven SESNe. Our models are consistent with the event rate densities, host environments, ejecta masses, and energetics of these different kinds of magnetar-driven SESNe, supporting that the isolated common-envelope formation channel could be a major common origin of magnetar-driven SESNe. The remnant compact binary systems of magnetar-driven SESNe are progenitors of some gravitational-wave transients and galactic systems.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
