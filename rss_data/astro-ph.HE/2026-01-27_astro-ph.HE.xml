      <title>Thermodynamic Characteristics of a Fermi Gas with an Invariant Energy Scale and its Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a relativistic Fermi gas governed by a modified dispersion relation in the Magueijo Smolin (MS) formulation of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), characterized by the presence of an invariant ultraviolet energy (deformation) scale. We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Single-Pulse Correlations in PSR B0329+54: Implications for Radio Emission Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual radio pulses from a pulsar are directly linked to the underlying emission processes and the associated magnetic field geometry within its magnetosphere. Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>On the hadronic origin of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission surrounding the young massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is the most massive known young star cluster in the Galaxy, and an extended $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1646-458 surrounding it has been detected up to 80 TeV in the very high energy, implying that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated effectively in the region. However, the dominant radiation process contributing to the $\gamma$-ray emission is not well constrained. In the present work, we develop a model of CR acceleration at the termination shock in the superbubble inflated by the interaction of the cluster wind from the Wd 1 with the surrounding interstellar medium. We then calculate the flux and radial profile of $\gamma$ rays produced by the inelastic collisions of the hadronic CRs with the ambient gas. Our results with reasonable parameters can explain well the spectrum and radial profile of the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458, and consequently the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458 is likely to be of hadronic origin.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Remnants of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Reconstructing Progenitor Star Properties and Explosion Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Recent JWST observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A) reveal unprecedented ejecta substructure, including a web of filaments and the enigmatic "Green Monster" (GM), characterized by nearly circular holes and rings. These features provide new constraints on supernova (SN) explosion physics and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions. We present high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a neutrino-driven SN explosion tailored to Cas A, following the system from core collapse to an age of $\sim 1000$ yr. The models include key physical processes such as hydrodynamic instabilities, Ni-bubble effects, radiative cooling, non-equilibrium ionization, and electron-ion temperature equilibration. Our results show that the filamentary ejecta network naturally forms during the early explosion due to the interaction of neutrino-driven bubbles and instabilities, retaining a memory of the initial conditions before being progressively modified by the reverse shock. The GM morphology is reproduced by the interaction of dense ejecta clumps with an asymmetric, forward-shocked CSM shell, with radiative cooling enhancing fragmentation and generating the observed holes and rings. Overall, our study demonstrates that Cas A's complex morphology reflects both the imprint of the explosion mechanism and subsequent ejecta-CSM interactions.</description>

      <title>Energy shift of Fe-K fluorescence lines due to low ionization demonstrated with XRISM in Centaurus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line at 6.4 keV is a powerful probe of cold matter surrounding X-ray sources and has been widely used in various astrophysical contexts. The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$\alpha$ line shifts redward by $\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$\beta$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$\alpha$, K$\beta$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$\alpha$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them.</description>

      <title>Joint constraint on the propagation origin of the cosmic-ray spectral knee from energy spectrum and anisotropy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin mechanism of the cosmic-ray knee region remains an unresolved mystery, with acceleration, interaction, and propagation models drawing significant attention. The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\rm \mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\rm \delta_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure.</description>

      <title>Spectral Evolution and Current Sheet Analysis as Probes of Reconnection-Mediated Decay in Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Gas Kinematics and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in the Gamma-ray SNRs W41 and G22.7-0.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the interstellar medium associated with the two middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) W41 and G22.7-0.2, both detected in TeV gamma-rays. Using high-angular-resolution $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) data from the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and HI data from the VLA, we investigated the spatial and kinematic properties of molecular and atomic gas that interact with the SNRs. We identified associated clouds in the velocity ranges of +50-+80 km s$^{-1}$ for W41 and +76-+110 km s$^{-1}$ for G22.7-0.2. Column density analysis indicates that target protons are dominated by molecular hydrogen, while atomic hydrogen contributes less than $\sim$10-15% even after correction for self-absorption. The mean proton densities are $\sim$1.2$\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for W41 and $\sim$5.3$\times$10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for G22.7-0.2. From the gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total energy of accelerated cosmic-ray protons as $W_\mathrm{p}$ $\sim$3$\times$10$^{47}$~erg for W41 and $\sim$1$\times$10$^{48}$ erg for G22.7-0.2, corresponding to 0.03-0.1% of the canonical supernova explosion energy. hese $W_\mathrm{p}$ values agree with the decreasing trend in $W_\mathrm{p}$ observed in the middle-aged SNRs within the previously reported SNR age-$W_\mathrm{p}$ relation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino opacities in magnetic fields for binary neutron star merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino interactions play a central role in transport and flavor evolution in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. Simulations suggest that neutron star mergers may produce magnetic fields as strong as $10^{17}$ G, but computational difficulties have hampered the inclusion of magnetic field effects in neutrino interaction rates. In this paper we give approximate interaction rates for neutrinos in the presence of strong magnetic fields, including the effects of Landau quantization and anomalous magnetic moments with errors of order $\sqrt{T/M}$. We also comment on a neutrino production channel from individual neutrons that can produce low-energy $\nu \bar{\nu}$ pairs even at low density.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Parametric Spectral Classification of Black Hole and Neutron Star X-ray Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the classification of black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems using deep neural networks applied to archival RXTE X-ray spectral data. We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors. Both models achieve high classification accuracies of ~90-94 %. To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $\chi^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.} %MDPI: Please confirm if the bold formatting is necessary; if not, please remove it.</description>

      <title>Resolution Dependence in Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\mathord{\approx}10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\mathord{\approx}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion shocks in galaxy clusters as sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory has found strong evidence supporting the extragalactic origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations.</description>

      <title>XFit: Global Optimization and Degeneracy Mapping in X-ray Spectral Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to modeling X-ray spectral data relies on local optimization methods, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models.</description>

      <title>Multi-epoch VLBI observations of the blazar 3C 66A: Spatial twisting and temporal oscillation of the parsec-scale jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.</description>

      <title>Radio streaks in the Lighthouse Nebula discovered with MeerKAT -- Particles escaping from the tail and illuminating the ambient magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae are valuable sources to investigate the dynamics of relativistic pulsar winds and the mechanisms by which they are converted into cosmic-ray leptons at the highest energies. The Lighthouse Nebula is one such object, famous for the high velocity of its pulsar and a long misaligned X-ray jet that is understood as a specific escape channel for the most energetic particles. We aim to get a better understanding of how the bulk of non-thermal particles are released into the interstellar medium. We focus on GHz radio observations, which probe lower-energy particles that are dominant in number and long-lived, thus offering a picture of how escape proceeds in the long run. We analyze 10.5h of MeerKAT observations in the 0.9-1.7GHz band. MeerKAT observations reveal a highly structured synchrotron nebula downstream of pulsar PSR J1101-6101. A cometary tail is detected up to beyond 5pc from the pulsar, while a system of multiple transverse two-sided emission streaks is observed for the first time. No radio counterpart of the misaligned X-ray jet is seen. The radio streaks are interpreted as the occasional charge-independent release of energetic leptons from the tail into the surrounding medium, as a result of dynamical instabilities and reconfiguration in the downstream flow. The intensity layout suggests that most of the particle content of the nebula is discharged into the ambient medium within several parsec. Once escaped, particles light up the ambient magnetic field, which appears to have a coherence length of at least a few parsec. The length and persistence of the streaks indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence, possibly slightly enhanced with respect to average cosmic-ray transport conditions in the Galaxy. Such a confinement may result from self-generated turbulence by resonant streaming instability, or be due to past activity of the progenitor star.</description>

      <title>Disk-jet-wind coupling from stellar mass to supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\dot{m}=L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.</description>

      <title>The growing family of gamma-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revision of the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of gamma-ray point sources (rev4FGL) revealed that the gamma-ray sky is populated by emerging populations of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) other than blazars and radio galaxies. Narrow-Line Seyfert 1, Seyfert 1, intermediate, and Seyfert 2 galaxies, changing-look AGN, plus a number of ambiguous or unclassified sources. After a short historical introduction on the gamma-ray observations of Seyfert-type AGN, I explore the main statistical properties of 1477 jetted AGN from the rev4FGL with spectroscopic redshift, and also the cross-match with Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) radio observations at 15~GHz from the Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments (MOJAVE) program. I then discuss the difference between gamma and non-gamma jetted AGN, and the implications on the classification.</description>

      <title>Closure models for the feedback of energetic particles on plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic particles interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood. Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thermal emission of old neutron stars with rotochemical heating and magnetized superconducting protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes induced stochastic axion-photon oscillations in primordial magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04605v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced in the very early Universe due to the large density fluctuations. The cosmic background of axion-like particles (ALPs) could be non-thermally generated by PBHs. In this paper, we investigate the ALPs emitted by ultra-light PBHs with the mass range $10 \, {\rm g} \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^9 \, \rm g$, in which PBHs would have completely evaporated before the start of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and can therefore not be directly constrained. In this case, the minimal scenario that ALPs could interact only with photons is supposed. We study the stochastic oscillations between the ALPs and photons in the cosmic magnetic field in detail. The primordial magnetic field (PMF) can be modelled as the stochastic background field model with the completely non-homogeneous component of the cosmic plasma. Using the latest stringent limits on PMF, we show the numerical results of ALP-photon oscillation probability distributions with the homogeneous and stochastic magnetic field scenarios. The PBH-induced stochastic ALP-photon oscillations in the PMF may have the effects on some further phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), and the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB).</description>

      <title>Tracing the Heliospheric Magnetic Field via Anisotropic Radio-Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical radio sources are embedded in turbulent magnetised environments. In the 1 MHz sky, solar radio bursts are the brightest sources, produced by electrons travelling along magnetic field lines from the Sun through the heliosphere. We demonstrate that the magnetic field not only guides the emitting electrons, but also directs radio waves via anisotropic scattering from density irregularities in the magnetised plasma. Using multi-vantage-point type III solar radio burst observations and anisotropic radio wave propagation simulations, we show that the interplanetary field structure is encoded in the observed radio emission directivity, and that large-scale turbulent channelling of radio waves is present over large distances, even for relatively weak anisotropy in the embedded density fluctuations. Tracing the radio emission at many frequencies (distances), the effects of anisotropic scattering can be disentangled from the electron motion along the interplanetary magnetic field, and the emission source locations are unveiled. Our analysis suggests that magnetic field structures within turbulent media could be reconstructed using radio observations and is found consistent with the Parker field, offering a novel method for remotely diagnosing the large-scale field structure in the heliosphere and other astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Relativistic Core Collapse of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos -- Limits On Seed Black Hole Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts pose challenges to standard seeding mechanisms. Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The optical photometric and spectroscopic periodicities of the cataclysmic variable SRGt 062340.2-265751</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on optical spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the eROSITA discovered transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 and show that it displays the characteristics of a nova-like cataclysmic variable (CV), with possible indications of being a magnetic system. We try to put better constraints on the classification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 using optical time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations to find any periodicities in the system. From these periodicities we can classify the CV sub-type that it belongs to. Spectroscopic observations revealed a very low amplitude, K $\sim$ 14 km s$^{-1}$, in the radial velocity of the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission lines, suggesting that the system is likely observed at a low inclination angle. High-speed photometric observations revealed highly stochastic variability, characteristic of many magnetic cataclysmic variable systems. A probable 3.645 $\pm$ 0.006 hour orbital period was found by applying Lomb-Scargle period analysis to the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission line radial velocities. A 24.905 $\pm$ 0.065 min period was found from photometric observations, which we associate with the white dwarf spin. However, it was also found that the photometry revealed multiple periodicities from night to night. TESS observations in three sectors did not reveal any of the periodicities found from ground-based observations, but did show a prominent period in only one sector, which might be attributed to a positive superhump period. These multiple periodicities as well as the HeII $\lambda$4686 and Bowen blend emission lines seen in the spectra indicate that SRGt 062340.2-265751 is likely a nova-like CV, and might belong to the VY Scl sub-type.</description>

      <title>SiGMa-Net II: Distinguishing Binary Black Holes from Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.</description>

Abstract: In the past few decades, X-ray astronomy satellites equipped with grating spectrometers and microcalorimeters have enabled high-resolution spectroscopic observations of astrophysical objects. The need for accurate atomic data has arose as we attempt detailed analysis of the high-resolution spectra they provide. This is because current spectral models, which heavily rely on theoretical calculations, entail non-negligible uncertainties. We employ a plasma spectroscopy device called electron beam ion trap (EBIT) to experimentally obtain precise atomic data. An EBIT with a design that allows combined operation with synchrotron radiation facilities was developed based on the Heidelberg Compact EBIT and installed at ISAS/JAXA for this purpose. We conducted a spectroscopic experiment using the JAXA-EBIT at the synchrotron radiation facility SPring-8, and successfully obtained high-resolution spectra of the L$\alpha$ resonance transition of Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ ions, 3C, as well as the K$\alpha$ resonance transition of He-like O$^{6+}$ ions. We also measured another Ne-like Fe$^{16+}$ L$\alpha$ resonance transition, 3G, and constrained an upper limit of the oscillator strength ratio of 3G to 3C, using our experimental results. The experimental values obtained in this study will be applied to observational studies of astrophysical objects as a part of the plasma spectral modeling.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: gas distributions inside and around haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.
  We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.
  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We estimate that statistically-robust detection requires sampling $\sim160$ haloes with $\sim20$ sightlines each, a task that can be achieved with current and future facilities like WEAVE, 4MOST, PFS, ELT and WST.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy on hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of the symmetry energy on the properties of compact stars is analyzed considering constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics. A compact star can be a neutron star composed only of nuclear matter or a hybrid star with a quark core. Two typical models (soft and stiff) are considered for the nuclear equation of state, and for the hybrid one, a parameterized first-order phase transition approach, completed with a linear quark matter equation of state, is implemented. We show that the phase transition reduces the tension between GW170817 and NICER observations, and we illustrate the impact of the symmetry energy for the understanding of the nature of the binary system in GW170817. We also confirm our previous findings that the GW170817 waveform is best described as a binary HS with a low-density onset of stiff quark matter. This could also be interpreted as a quarkyonic cross-over.</description>

      <title>Baryonification III: An accurate analytical model for the dispersion measure probability density function of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully analytical framework for predicting the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of dispersion measures (DM) for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the baryonification (BFC) model. BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($\mu$), and outer truncation ($\delta$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.</description>

      <title>Large Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts from Strong 3-body Interactions in Dense Stellar Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves (GWs) can be modulated by the astrophysical environment surrounding the source, which provides a probe for the origin of individual binary black holes (BBHs) using GWs alone. We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidence between magnetars and IceCube detected neutrinos</title>

Abstract: We implement a search for spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector (using the publicly available 10-year muon track data) and 37 magnetars, including six extragalactic sources. We use the unbinned maximum likelihood method for our analysis. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the known magnetars and IceCube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the known galactic or extragalactic magnetars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux observed in IceCube. A stacked analysis also does not show a statistically significant excess.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-Disk Collisions for Quasiperiodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>The environment of TeV halo progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TeV haloes are extended sources of very-high-energy gamma rays found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding the type of medium pulsars probe over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions - where they receive a natal kick - until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; and (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess the medium in which pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derived the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population and then applied the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the interstellar medium at around 300 kyr, significantly later than assumed in the literature. Given our assumptions, all known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. To test this, we provide the probability that known pulsars still reside in their parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</description>

Abstract: DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles. This first paper in a series provides an overview of the analytical framework behind the model, consisting of an integral formulation of the relativistic transport equations (Boltzmann equations) and a discretisation procedure for the particle distribution function (Distribution-In-Plateaux). The latter allows for the evaluation of anisotropic interactions, and generates a conservative numerical scheme for a distribution function's transport through phase space.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in Active Galactic Nuclei Ultrafast Outflow Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A in a High Density Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19132v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50~cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Einstein Probe, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+3\times 10^4$ s (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0 \sim 5\times 10^4$ s, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a collapsar environment.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>A Tidal Disruption Event from an Intermediate-mass Black Hole Revealed by Comprehensive Multi-wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star crosses the tidal radius of a black hole (BH) and is ripped apart, providing a powerful way to probe dormant BHs over a wide mass range. In this study, we present our late-time observations and comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of AT2018cqh, a TDE at the center of a dwarf galaxy that exhibited successive flares in the optical, X-ray, and radio bands. We discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories. The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, from the dynamics of compact object mergers and stellar collapses to the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the common observation even when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, i.e. not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Using data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, including sub-threshold events, we searched for common sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We derive constraints on the rate densities of joint sources. Our results constrain the isotropic neutrino emission from gravitational-wave sources for very high values of the total energy emitted in neutrinos (&gt; $10^{52} - 10^{54}$ erg).</description>

      <title>Rate of Repeating Tidal Disruption Events with 5--19 years interval constrained by CRTS and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistics on tidal disruption events (TDEs) may be contaminated by repeating TDEs (rTDEs), which have been extensively discovered recently. However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $&gt;5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z&lt;0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $&lt;20$ years may account for 25\%--60\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs. If so, the high fraction of rTDEs suggests that the observed optical TDE rate has been overestimated. However, the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations. We also argue that this can possibly be used as another tool to constrain exoticness of compact objects in a binary.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions ($\nu$SI) mediated by light bosonic particles can produce characteristic spectral dips in astrophysical neutrino fluxes, thereby altering the expected energy spectrum. The high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectrum has been extensively used to probe $\nu$SI models through these distinctive features. The recent detection of the ultrahigh-energy event KM3-230213A presents a new opportunity to explore $\nu$SI phenomenology at extreme energies. In this work, we investigate two implications of this observation, assuming the event originates from a diffuse power-law spectrum. First, we find that $\nu$SI-induced spectral distortions can mildly alleviate the tension between the KM3-230213A detection and the previous non-observation of PeV-scale neutrinos in IceCube data. Second, we derive the strongest constraints on the $\tau$-flavored $\nu$SI coupling strength for mediator masses around 100 MeV. Our analysis shows that neutrino telescopes can surpass existing collider bounds in this mass range. In the near future, IceCube-Gen2 is expected to significantly enhance $\nu$SI sensitivity, including regions relevant to alleviating the Hubble and neutrino mass tensions.</description>

      <title>The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 -- I. Presentation of the Data and Detailed Exploration of the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We deem the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios to be physically plausible. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a binary candidate deserving further study. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.</description>

      <title>Cooling of quark stars from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of quark stars with and without a hadronic crust using an equation of state derived from perturbative QCD that incorporates the running of the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Our analysis reveals that bare quark stars cool too rapidly to match the luminosity data, including those of the coldest observed isolated neutron stars, even when the uncertainty from the renormalization scale is taken into account. In contrast, configurations featuring a hadronic crust exhibit slower cooling and improved agreement with observational data. We also observe that the cooling band for bare quark stars narrows significantly after $t \sim 1$ year, whereas the configurations with a crust exhibit a larger uncertainty throughout their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gravitational Effects of Radiation and Cosmological Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the momentarily comoving frame of a cosmological fluid, the determinant of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) is highly sensitive to its pressure. This component is significant during radiation-dominated epochs and becomes naturally negligible as the universe transitions to the matter-dominated era. Here, we investigate the cosmological consequences of gravity sourced by the determinant of the EMT. Unlike Azri and Nasri, Phys. Lett. B 836, 137626 (2023), we consider the most general scenario in which the second order variation of the perfect-fluid Lagrangian does not vanish. We analyze the dynamics of the power-law case and explore the cosmological implications of the scale-free model characterized by dimensionless couplings to photons and neutrinos. We show that, unlike various theories based on the EMT, the present setup, which leads to enhanced gravitational effects of radiation (EGER), does not alter the time evolution of the energy density of particle species. Using current cosmological observations, we constrain the model parameters and show that EGER may offer a viable mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Although it exhibits a phenomenological analogy to tightly-coupled relativistic fluid scenarios, EGER remains purely gravitational in origin and yields distinguishable signatures in the small-scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The radiation-gravity couplings we propose here are expected to yield testable cosmological and astrophysical signatures, probing whether gravity distinguishes between relativistic and nonrelativistic species in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Missing Massive Sector: Massive Boson Stars -- Stability and GW Emission in Head-on Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of $2.14~\mathrm{dex}$ on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of $4.78~\mathrm{dex}$. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>Stimulated radiation from superradiant scalar cloud in scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>
