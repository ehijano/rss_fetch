      <title>On the Interplay of Clustering and Evolution in the Emergence of Epidemic Outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an increasingly interconnected world, a key scientific challenge is to examine mechanisms that lead to the widespread propagation of contagions, such as misinformation and pathogens, and identify risk factors that can trigger large-scale outbreaks. Underlying both the spread of disease and misinformation epidemics is the evolution of the contagion as it propagates, leading to the emergence of different strains, e.g., through genetic mutations in pathogens and alterations in the information content. Recent studies have revealed that models that do not account for heterogeneity in transmission risks associated with different strains of the circulating contagion can lead to inaccurate predictions. However, existing results on multi-strain spreading assume that the network has a vanishingly small clustering coefficient, whereas clustering is widely known to be a fundamental property of real-world social networks. In this work, we investigate spreading processes that entail evolutionary adaptations on random graphs with tunable clustering and arbitrary degree distributions. We derive a mathematical framework to quantify the epidemic characteristics of a contagion that evolves as it spreads, with the structure of the underlying network as given via arbitrary {\em joint} degree distributions of single-edges and triangles. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly analyze the impact of clustering and evolution on the emergence of epidemic outbreaks. We supplement our theoretical finding with numerical simulations and case studies, shedding light on the impact of clustering on contagion spread.</description>

      <title>Intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media: A bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widely distributed misinformation shared across social media channels is a pressing issue that poses a significant threat to many aspects of society's well-being. Inaccurate shared information causes confusion, can adversely affect mental health, and can lead to mis-informed decision-making. Therefore, it is important to implement proactive measures to intervene and curb the spread of misinformation where possible. This has prompted scholars to investigate a variety of intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media. This study explores the typology of intervention strategies for addressing misinformation sharing on social media, identifying 4 important clusters - cognition-based, automated-based, information-based, and hybrid-based. The literature selection process utilized the PRISMA method to ensure a systematic and comprehensive analysis of relevant literature while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. A total of 139 articles published from 2013-2023 were then analyzed. Meanwhile, bibliometric analyses were conducted using performance analysis and science mapping techniques for the typology development. A comparative analysis of the typology was conducted to reveal patterns and evolution in the field. This provides valuable insights for both theory and practical applications. Overall, the study concludes that scholarly contributions to scientific research and publication help to address research gaps and expand knowledge in this field. Understanding the evolution of intervention strategies for misinformation sharing on social media can support future research that contributes to the development of more effective and sustainable solutions to this persistent problem.</description>

      <title>An Art-centric perspective on AI-based content moderation of nudity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a time when the influence of generative Artificial Intelligence on visual arts is a highly debated topic, we raise the attention towards a more subtle phenomenon: the algorithmic censorship of artistic nudity online. We analyze the performance of three "Not-Safe-For-Work'' image classifiers on artistic nudity, and empirically uncover the existence of a gender and a stylistic bias, as well as evident technical limitations, especially when only considering visual information. Hence, we propose a multi-modal zero-shot classification approach that improves artistic nudity classification. From our research, we draw several implications that we hope will inform future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Beyond Redundancy: Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) aims to learn node representations on various edge types without manual labeling. However, existing research overlooks a key factor: the reliability of the graph structure. Real-world data often exhibit a complex nature and contain abundant task-irrelevant noise, severely compromising UMGL's performance. Moreover, existing methods primarily rely on contrastive learning to maximize mutual information across different graphs, limiting them to multiplex graph redundant scenarios and failing to capture view-unique task-relevant information. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly learn a fused graph from multiple graphs that preserve sufficient task-relevant information while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses graph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously maximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby tackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph. Theoretical analyses further guarantee the effectiveness of InfoMGF. Comprehensive experiments against various baselines on different downstream tasks demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. Surprisingly, our unsupervised method even beats the sophisticated supervised approaches. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/zxlearningdeep/InfoMGF.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility Modeling with Limited Information via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility patterns has traditionally been a complex challenge in transportation modeling. Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-quality training datasets across diverse locations, conventional activity-based models and learning-based human mobility modeling algorithms are particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Furthermore, current research mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal travel pattern but lacks an understanding of the semantic information between activities, which is crucial for modeling the interdependence between activities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) empowered human mobility modeling framework. Our proposed approach significantly reduces the reliance on detailed human mobility statistical data, utilizing basic socio-demographic information of individuals to generate their daily mobility patterns. We have validated our results using the NHTS and SCAG-ABM datasets, demonstrating the effective modeling of mobility patterns and the strong adaptability of our framework across various geographic locations.</description>

      <title>Mobility in Age-Based Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a gossiping network where a source forwards updates to a set of $n$ gossiping nodes that are placed in an arbitrary graph structure and gossip with their neighbors. In this paper, we analyze how mobility of nodes affects the freshness of nodes in the gossiping network. To model mobility, we let nodes randomly exchange positions with other nodes in the network. The position of the node determines how the node interacts with the rest of the network. In order to quantify information freshness, we use the version age of information metric. We use the stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework to derive recursive equations to find the version age for a set of positions in the network in terms of the version ages of sets of positions that are one larger or of the same size. We use these recursive equations to find an upper bound for the average version age of a node in two example networks. We show that mobility can decrease the version age of nodes in a disconnected network from linear scaling in $n$ to at most square root scaling and even to constant scaling in some cases. We perform numerical simulations to analyze how mobility affects the version age of different positions in the network and also show that the upper bounds obtained for the example networks are tight.</description>

      <title>Solidago: A Modular Collaborative Scoring Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Solidago, an end-to-end modular pipeline to allow any community of users to collaboratively score any number of entities. Solidago proposes a six-module decomposition. First, it uses pretrust and peer-to-peer vouches to assign trust scores to users. Second, based on participation, trust scores are turned into voting rights per user per entity. Third, for each user, a preference model is learned from the user's evaluation data. Fourth, users' models are put on a similar scale. Fifth, these models are securely aggregated. Sixth, models are post-processed to yield human-readable global scores. We also propose default implementations of the six modules, including a novel trust propagation algorithm, and adaptations of state-of-the-art scaling and aggregation solutions. Our pipeline has been successfully deployed on the open-source platform tournesol.app. We thereby lay an appealing foundation for the collaborative, effective, scalable, fair, interpretable and secure scoring of any set of entities.</description>

      <title>The Susceptibility Paradox in Online Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding susceptibility to online influence is crucial for mitigating the spread of misinformation and protecting vulnerable audiences. This paper investigates susceptibility to influence within social networks, focusing on the differential effects of influence-driven versus spontaneous behaviors on user content adoption. Our analysis reveals that influence-driven adoption exhibits high homophily, indicating that individuals prone to influence often connect with similarly susceptible peers, thereby reinforcing peer influence dynamics, whereas spontaneous adoption shows significant but lower homophily. Additionally, we extend the Generalized Friendship Paradox to influence-driven behaviors, demonstrating that users' friends are generally more susceptible to influence than the users themselves, de facto establishing the notion of Susceptibility Paradox in online social influence. This pattern does not hold for spontaneous behaviors, where friends exhibit fewer spontaneous adoptions. We find that susceptibility to influence can be predicted using friends' susceptibility alone, while predicting spontaneous adoption requires additional features, such as user metadata. These findings highlight the complex interplay between user engagement and characteristics in spontaneous content adoption. Our results provide new insights into social influence mechanisms and offer implications for designing more effective moderation strategies to protect vulnerable audiences.</description>

      <title>MeSH Concept Relevance and Knowledge Evolution: A Data-driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), one of the main knowledge organization systems in the biomedical domain, constantly evolves following the latest scientific discoveries in health and life sciences. Previous research focused on quantifying information in MeSH using its hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on information theory and network analyses to quantify the relevance of MeSH concepts. Our approach leverages article annotations and their citation networks to compute informativeness, usefulness, disruptiveness, and influence of MeSH concepts over time. Using the the citation network and the MeSH hierarchy, different relevance aspects are computed, and an aggregation algorithm is used to propagate the relevance scores to the parent nodes. We evaluated our approach using changes in the terminology and showed that it effectively captures the evolution of MeSH concepts. At the first level of the hierarchy, the most relevant concept - Chemical and Drugs - had a decreasing trend (\textit{p}-value $&lt; 0.01$), while at the second level, the most relevant concept - Neoplasms - had an increasing trend (\textit{p}-value $&lt; 0.01$). We show that the mean relevance of evolving concepts is higher for concepts that remained unchanged (2.09E-03 \textit{vs.} 8.46E-04). Moreover, we validated the ability of our framework to characterize retracted articles and showed that concepts used to annotate retracted articles (mean relevance: 0.17) differ substantially from those used to annotate non-retracted ones (mean relevance: 0.15). The proposed framework provides an effective method to rank concept relevance and can be useful in maintaining evolving knowledge organization systems.</description>

      <title>User Behavior Analysis and Clustering in a MMO Mobile Game: Insights and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of user behavior and clustering in a popular mobile battle royale game, employing temporal and static data mining techniques to uncover distinct player segments. Our methodology encompasses time series K-means clustering, graph-based algorithms (DeepWalk and LINE), and static attribute clustering, visualized through innovative hybrid charts. Key findings reveal significant variations in player engagement, skill levels, and social interactions across five primary user segments, ranging from highly active and skilled players to inactive or new users. We also analyze the impact of external factors on user retention and the network structure within clusters, uncovering correlations between cluster cohesion and player activity levels. This research provides valuable insights for game developers and marketers, offering data-driven recommendations for personalized game experiences, targeted marketing strategies, and improved player retention in online gaming environments.</description>

      <title>A Starting Point for Dynamic Community Detection with Leiden Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs often evolve over time, making community or cluster detection a crucial task. In this technical report, we extend three dynamic approaches - Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) - to our multicore implementation of the Leiden algorithm, known for its high-quality community detection. Our experiments, conducted on a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve average speedups of 1.37x, 1.47x, and 1.98x on large graphs with random batch updates, and 1.07x, 1.10x, and 1.13x on real-world dynamic graphs, compared to the Static Leiden algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm. We hope these early results pave the way for further development of dynamic approaches for evolving graphs.</description>
