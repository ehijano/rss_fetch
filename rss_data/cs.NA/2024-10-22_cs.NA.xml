      <title>Graph Regularized Sparse $L_{2,1}$ Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an effective algorithm for multivariate data analysis, including applications to feature selection, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Its variant, Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNF), extends the ability of NMF to render parts-based data representations to include mixed-sign data. Graph Regularized SNF builds upon this paradigm by adding a graph regularization term to preserve the local geometrical structure of the data space. Despite their successes, SNF-related algorithms to date still suffer from instability caused by the Frobenius norm due to the effects of outliers and noise. In this paper, we present a new $L_{2,1}$ SNF algorithm that utilizes the noise-insensitive $L_{2,1}$ norm. We provide monotonic convergence analysis of the $L_{2,1}$ SNF algorithm. In addition, we conduct numerical experiments on three benchmark mixed-sign datasets as well as several randomized mixed-sign matrices to demonstrate the performance superiority of $L_{2,1}$ SNF over conventional SNF algorithms under the influence of Gaussian noise at different levels.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Exact local conservation of energy in fully implicit PIC algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the issue of strict, fully discrete \emph{local} energy conservation for a whole class of fully implicit local-charge- and global-energy-conserving particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms. Earlier studies demonstrated these algorithms feature strict global energy conservation. However, whether a local energy conservation theorem exists (in which the local energy update is governed by a flux balance equation at every mesh cell) for these schemes is unclear. In this study, we show that a local energy conservation theorem indeed exists. We begin our analysis with the 1D electrostatic PIC model without orbit-averaging, and then generalize our conclusions to account for orbit averaging, multiple dimensions, and electromagnetic models (Darwin). In all cases, a temporally, spatially, and particle-discrete local energy conservation theorem is shown to exist, proving that these formulations (as originally proposed in the literature), in addition to being locally charge conserving, are strictly locally energy conserving as well. In contrast to earlier proofs of local conservation in the literature \citep{xiao2017local}, which only considered continuum time, our result is valid for the fully implicit time-discrete version of all models, including important features such as orbit averaging. We demonstrate the local-energy-conservation property numerically with a paradigmatic numerical example.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Scheme Using Biorthogonal Wavelets on Intervals for 2D Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a wavelet Galerkin method for solving two-dimensional elliptic interface problems of the form in $-\nabla\cdot(a\nabla u)=f$ in $\Omega\backslash \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a smooth interface within $\Omega$. The variable scalar coefficient $a&gt;0$ and source term $f$ may exhibit discontinuities across $\Gamma$. By utilizing a biorthogonal wavelet basis derived from bilinear finite elements, which serves as a Riesz basis for $H^1_0(\Omega)$, we devise a strategy that achieves nearly optimal convergence rates: $O(h^2 |\log(h)|^2)$ in the $L_2(\Omega)$-norm and $O(h |\log(h)|)$ in the $H^1(\Omega)$-norm with respect to the approximation order. To handle the geometry of $\Gamma$ and the singularities of the solution $u$, which has a discontinuous gradient across $\Gamma$, additional wavelet elements are introduced along the interface. The dual part of the biorthogonal wavelet basis plays a crucial role in proving these convergence rates. We develop weighted Bessel properties for wavelets, derive various inequalities in fractional Sobolev spaces, and employ finite element arguments to establish the theoretical convergence results. To achieve higher accuracy and effectively handle high-contrast coefficients $a$, our method, much like meshfree approaches, relies on augmenting the number of wavelet elements throughout the domain and near the interface, eliminating the need for re-meshing as in finite element methods. Unlike all other methods for solving elliptic interface problems, the use of a wavelet Riesz basis for $H^1_0(\Omega)$ ensures that the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices remain small and uniformly bounded, regardless of the matrix size.</description>

      <title>Non-oscillatory entropy stable DG schemes for hyperbolic conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of non-oscillatory, entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin (NOES-DG) schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. By incorporating a specific form of artificial viscosity, our new scheme directly controls entropy production and suppresses spurious oscillations. To address the stiffness introduced by the artificial terms, which can restrict severely time step sizes, we employ the integration factor strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method for time discretization. Furthermore, our method remains compatible with positivity-preserving limiters under suitable CFL conditions in extreme cases. Various numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme, showing that it maintains high-order accuracy in smooth regions and avoids spurious oscillations near discontinuities.</description>

      <title>A Wrinkling Model for General Hyperelastic Materials based on Tension Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wrinkling is the phenomenon of out-of-plane deformation patterns in thin walled structures, as a result of a local compressive (internal) loads in combination with a large membrane stiffness and a small but non-zero bending stiffness. Numerical modelling typically involves thin shell formulations. As the mesh resolution depends on the wrinkle wave lengths, the analysis can become computationally expensive for shorter ones. Implicitly modeling the wrinkles using a modified kinematic or constitutive relationship based on a taut, slack or wrinkled state derived from a so-called tension field, a simplification is introduced in order to reduce computational efforts. However, this model was restricted to linear elastic material models in previous works. Aiming to develop an implicit isogeometric wrinkling model for large strain and hyperelastic material applications, a modified deformation gradient has been assumed, which can be used for any strain energy density formulation. The model is an extension of a previously published model for linear elastic material behaviour and is generalized to other types of discretisation as well. The extension for hyperelastic materials requires the derivative of the material tensor, which can be computed numerically or derived analytically. The presented model relies on a combination of dynamic relaxation and a Newton-Raphson solver, because of divergence in early Newton-Raphson iterations as a result of a changing tension field, which is not included in the stress tensor variation. Using four benchmarks, the model performance is evaluated. Convergence with the expected order for Newton-Raphson iterations has been observed, provided a fixed tension field. The model accurately approximates the mean surface of a wrinkled membrane with a reduced number of degrees of freedom in comparison to a shell solution.</description>

      <title>Randomised methods for dynamical low-rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces new dynamical low-rank (DLR) methods for solving large-scale matrix differential equations, motivated by algorithms from randomised numerical linear algebra.
  The new methods consist essentially of two steps: a range estimation step followed by a post-processing step. The range estimation is done by a newly developed dynamical rangefinder method. Then, we propose two ways to perform the post-processing leading to two time-stepping methods that we respectively call dynamical randomised singular value decomposition (DRSVD) and dynamical generalised Nystr\"om (DGN). The new methods have natural extensions to the rank-adaptive framework.
  The cost of the new methods is comparable to existing DLR techniques, and their numerical performance make them very competitive; the experiments show that the new methods are very accurate and have little variance despite their inherent randomness. Our results suggest moreover that the new methods are robust to stiffness, and critical physical quantities such as the energy and geometry of the solution are numerically preserved. Interestingly, the new methods do not show any step-size restriction and can be used as one-step solvers.</description>

      <title>On The Variance of Schatten $p$-Norm Estimation with Gaussian Sketching Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo matrix trace estimation is a popular randomized technique to estimate the trace of implicitly-defined matrices via averaging quadratic forms across several observations of a random vector. The most common approach to analyze the quality of such estimators is to consider the variance over the total number of observations. In this paper we present a procedure to compute the variance of the estimator proposed by Kong and Valiant [Ann. Statist. 45 (5), pp. 2218 - 2247] for the case of Gaussian random vectors and provide a sharper bound than previously available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the approximation property of ReLU neural networks (NNs) to piecewise constant functions with unknown interfaces in bounded regions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under the assumption that the discontinuity interface $\Gamma$ may be approximated by a connected series of hyperplanes with a prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we show that a three-layer ReLU NN is sufficient to accurately approximate any piecewise constant function and establish its error bound. Moreover, if the discontinuity interface is convex, an analytical formula of the ReLU NN approximation with exact weights and biases is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a universal approximation property of ODENet and ResNet. The ODENet is a map from an initial value to the final value of an ODE system in a finite interval. It is considered a mathematical model of a ResNet-type deep learning system. We consider dynamical systems with vector fields given by a single composition of the activation function and an affine mapping, which is the most common choice of the ODENet or ResNet vector field in actual machine learning systems. We show that such an ODENet and ResNet with a restricted vector field can uniformly approximate ODENet with a general vector field.</description>

      <title>Large-Eddy Simulations of Stochastic Burgers Turbulence Using Fully Conservative Higher-Order Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in turbulent flows continues to be a critical area of research, particularly in understanding the behavior of small-scale turbulence structures and their impact on resolved scales. In this study, we focus on the LES of turbulent flows, particularly the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE), using fully conservative higher-order schemes. The interaction between spatial discretization and SubGrid-Scale (SGS) modeling is explored rigorously by validating these schemes against analytical solutions for both the Linear Advection-Diffusion (LAD) equation and the Non-Linear Burgers (NLB) equation under laminar conditions. This ensures robustness before applying the approach to LES of stochastic turbulence. The study investigates how second-order and fourth-order discretization schemes influence the dynamic coefficients of various SGS models, including Constant Smagorinsky (CS), Dynamic Smagorinsky (DS), Dynamic Wong-Lilly (DWL), 1.5-order Turbulent Kinetic Energy Deardorff (TKED), Equilibrium Heinz (EH), and Dynamic Heinz (DH) models. The second-order scheme was found to amplify fluctuations in dynamic SGS coefficients due to its higher numerical dissipation, contrasting with the more stable behavior observed with the fourth order scheme, which better captures resolved scales and results in smaller dynamic coefficients. Despite inherent differences in SGS models and discretization schemes, the final velocity distributions in one dimensional turbulence simulations were remarkably consistent, suggesting a limited influence of SGS modeling on large-scale structures in simplified turbulence scenarios. However, notable variations in resolved-scale kinetic energy were uncovered, emphasizing the importance of accurately capturing small-scale turbulence structures for precise energy dissipation predictions in LES.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of an Accurate Algebraic Scheme for Sharp Interface Advection in Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an efficient algebraic scheme known as MULES for sharp interface advection, verified against various schemes including first-order upwind, second-order central, van Leer flux limiter, and Geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF). Two problems involving a droplet in a two-dimensional (2D) vortex and a stationary droplet were examined. The model assessed the effects of the Interface Compression (IC) coefficient, ranging from 0 to 2, analyzing parameters such as Interface Advection Error (IAE) and Mass Conservation Error (MCE). Results indicated that increasing IC values enhanced interface tracking accuracy but introduced non-physical instabilities at higher values, compromising mass conservation. Specifically, the IAE decreased from 4.8% to 3.95% as IC increased from 0 to 2, showing a favorable effect until IC surpassed 1.4, where IAE fluctuated around 4%. Conversely, the MCE rose steeply from 0% to 23.19%, driven by parasitic currents and numerical instabilities. Additionally, MULES and van Leer flux limiter schemes evaluated volume fraction smoothing effects. Initial filtering reduced Dimensionless Pressure Difference (DPD) and Capillary Number (Ca), stabilizing the solution, but excessive filtering reintroduced numerical errors and instabilities. With one filtering step, DPD reduced by 0.23 and Ca dropped significantly by 73.31%, improving solution stability. However, further filtering increased DPD and Ca, reflecting the reintroduction of numerical errors. The maximum velocity of parasitic flow around the droplet initially decreased by almost 75% but increased by 30.92% with excessive filtering. IAE increased from 0.7 to 0.9 with initial filtering, then decreased to 0.63 with additional steps, indicating improved solver performance on smoother interfaces.</description>

      <title>Toroidal density-equalizing map for genus-one surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-equalizing map is a shape deformation technique originally developed for cartogram creation and sociological data visualization on planar geographical maps. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing density-equalizing mapping methods for surface and volumetric domains and applying them to various problems in geometry processing and imaging science. However, the existing surface density-equalizing mapping methods are only applicable to surfaces with relatively simple topologies but not surfaces with topological holes. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm for computing density-equalizing maps for toroidal surfaces. In particular, different shape deformation effects can be easily achieved by prescribing different population functions on the torus and performing diffusion-based deformations on a planar domain with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, the proposed toroidal density-equalizing mapping method naturally leads to an effective method for computing toroidal parameterizations of genus-one surfaces with controllable shape changes, with the toroidal area-preserving parameterization being a prime example. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

Traditional numerical methods, such as the Finite Difference Method and the Finite Volume Method, have been widely employed in fluid dynamics but struggle to accurately capture the complexities of turbulence, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes. These methods often require significant computational resources and are prone to errors in nonlinear dynamic systems. The High-Order Dynamic Integration Method addresses these challenges by integrating higher-order interpolation techniques with dynamic adaptation strategies, significantly enhancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Through rigorous numerical analysis, this method demonstrates superior performance over the Finite Difference Method and the Finite Volume Method in handling the nonlinear behaviors characteristic of turbulent flows. Furthermore, the High-Order Dynamic Integration Method achieves this without a substantial increase in computational cost, making it a highly efficient tool for simulations in computational fluid dynamics. The research validates the capabilities of the High-Order Dynamic Integration Method through a series of benchmark tests and case studies. Results indicate a marked improvement in both accuracy and stability, particularly in simulations of high-Reynolds-number flows, where traditional methods often falter. This innovative approach offers a robust and efficient alternative for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, contributing to advances in the field of numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present an open-source CUDA-based package that consists of a compilation of exponential integrators where the action of the matrix exponential or the $\varphi_l$ functions on a vector is approximated using the method of polynomial interpolation at Leja points. Using a couple of test examples on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we show that one can achieve significant speedups using CUDA over the corresponding CPU code. LeXInt, written in a modular format, facilitates easy integration into any existing software package, and can be used for temporal integration of any differential equation.</description>

      <title>Augmented physics informed extreme learning machine to solve the biharmonic equations via Fourier expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the sensitivity of parameter and dissatisfactory precision for physics informed extreme machine learning (called PIELM) with common sigmoid, tangent and gaussian activation functions in solving high order partial differential equations (PDEs) arised from the fields of scientific computation and engineering applications. In this work, a Fourier induced PIELM (dubbed FPIELM) is proposed to approximate the solution for a class of fourth-order biharmonic equations with two types boundary conditions on unitized and non-unitized domains. By calculating carefully the differential operator and boundary operator of biharmonic equation on discretized collections, the solution of this high-order equation is casted into a linear least squares minimization problem. Additionally, we assess our FPIELM method with various hidden nodes and scale factor of uniform distribution initialization, then determine the optimal value range of the two hyperparameters required. Numerical experiments and comparsions for the FPIELM method and the other PIELM methods demonstrate that the proposed FPIELM method is more stable and robust, more high-precious and efficient in addressing biharmonic equations in both regular and irregular domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the library lymph for the finite element numerical discretization of coupled multi-physics problems. lymph is a Matlab library for the discretization of partial differential equations based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids (PolyDG) for spatial discretization coupled with suitable finite-difference time marching schemes. The objective of the paper is to introduce the library by describing it in terms of installation, input/output data, and code structure, highlighting - when necessary - key implementation aspects related to the method. A user guide, proceeding step-by-step in the implementation and solution of a Poisson problem, is also provided. In the last part of the paper, we show the results obtained for several differential problems, namely the Poisson problem, the heat equation, the elastodynamics system, and a multiphysics problem coupling poroelasticity and acoustic equations. Through these examples, we show the convergence properties and highlight some of the main features of the proposed method, i.e. geometric flexibility, high-order accuracy, and robustness with respect to heterogeneous physical parameters.</description>

      <title>High order recovery of geometric interfaces from cell-average data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering characteristic functions $u:=\chi_\Omega$ from cell-average data on a coarse grid, and where $\Omega$ is a compact set of $\mathbb{R}^d$. This task arises in very different contexts such as image processing, inverse problems, and the accurate treatment of interfaces in finite volume schemes. While linear recovery methods are known to perform poorly, nonlinear strategies based on local reconstructions of the jump interface $\Gamma:=\partial\Omega$ by geometrically simpler interfaces may offer significant improvements. We study two main families of local reconstruction schemes, the first one based on nonlinear least-squares fitting, the second one based on the explicit computation of a polynomial-shaped curve fitting the data, which yields simpler numerical computations and high order geometric fitting. For each of them, we derive a general theoretical framework which allows us to control the recovery error by the error of best approximation up to a fixed multiplicative constant. Numerical tests in 2d illustrate the expected approximation order of these strategies. Several extensions are discussed, in particular the treatment of piecewise smooth interfaces with corners.</description>

      <title>Simulating Irregular Symmetry Breaking in Gut Cross Sections Using a Novel Energy-Optimization Approach in Growth-Elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth-elasticity is a powerful model framework for understanding complex shape development in soft biological tissues. At each instant, by mapping how continuum building blocks have grown geometrically and how they respond elastically to the push-and-pull from their neighbors, the shape of the growing structure is determined from a state of mechanical equilibrium. As mechanical loads continue to be added to the system through growth, many interesting shapes, such as smooth wavy wrinkles, sharp creases, and deep folds, can form on the tissue surface from a relatively flatter geometry.
  Previous numerical simulations of growth-elasticity have reproduced many interesting shapes resembling those observed in reality, such as the foldings on mammalian brains and guts. In the case of mammalian guts, it has been shown that wavy wrinkles, deep folds, and sharp creases on the interior organ surface can be simulated even under a simple assumption of isotropic uniform growth in the interior layer of the organ. Interestingly, the simulated patterns are all regular along the tube's circumference, whereas some undulation patterns in reality exhibit irregular patterns and a mixture of sharp creases and smooth indentations.
  In this paper, we have discovered abundant shape solutions with irregular indentation patterns by developing a Rayleigh-Ritz finite-element method. This approach enables the capture of more solutions that cannot be easily reached by previous methods. In addition to the previously found regular smooth and non-smooth configurations, we have identified a new transitional irregular smooth shape, new shapes with a mixture of smooth and non-smooth surface indentations, and a variety of irregular patterns with different numbers of creases. Our numerical results demonstrate that growth-elasticity modeling can match more shape patterns observed in reality than previously thought.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for dispersive solutions of the nonlocal Sine-Gordon equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moved by the need for rigorous and reliable numerical tools for the analysis of peridynamic materials, the authors propose a model able to capture the dispersive features of nonlocal soliton-like solutions obtained by a peridynamic formulation of the Sine-Gordon equation. The analysis of the Cauchy problem associated to the peridynamic Sine-Gordon equation with local Neumann boundary condition is performed in this work through a spectral method on Chebyshev polynomials nodes joined with the Stormer-Verlet scheme for the time evolution. The choice for using the spectral method resides in the resulting reachable numerical accuracy, while, indeed, Chebyshev polynomials allow straightforward implementation of local boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are proposed for thoroughly describe the ability of such scheme. Specifically, dispersive effects of the specific peridynamic kernel are demonstrated, while the internal energy behavior of the specified peridynamic operator is studied.</description>

Abstract: We proved convergence rates of linear sampling recovery of functions in an abstract Bochner space satisfying some weighted $\ell_2$-summability of their generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients, by extended least squares methods. As applications to a problem in Computational Uncertainty Quantification, we derived convergence rates of linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs with log-normal random inputs, and of relevant infinite dimensional holomorphic functions on $\mathbb R^\infty$. These convergence rates significantly improve the known results. From the general results we also received the same convergence rates of linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs with affine random inputs.</description>

      <title>Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attainment of accurate numerical solutions of ill-conditioned linear algebraic problems involving totally positive matrices has been gathering considerable attention among researchers over the last years. In parallel, the interest of $q$-calculus has been steadily growing in the literature. In this work the $q$-analogue of the Abel polynomial basis is studied. The total positivity of the matrix of change of basis between monomial and $q$-Abel bases is characterized, providing its bidiagonal factorization. Moreover, well-known high relative accuracy results of Vandermonde matrices corresponding to increasing positive nodes are extended to the decreasing negative case. This further allows to solve with high relative accuracy several algebraic problems concerning collocation, Wronskian and Gramian matrices of $q$-Abel polynomials. Finally, a series of numerical tests support the presented theoretical results and illustrate the goodness of the method where standard approaches fail to deliver accurate solutions.</description>

      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>New asymptotic expansion formula via Malliavin calculus and its application to rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13405v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Rank-1 Completion Problem for Cubic Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the rank-$1$ tensor completion problem for cubic tensors. First of all, we show that this problem is equivalent to a special rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. When the tensor is strongly rank-$1$ completable, we show that the problem is equivalent to a rank-$1$ matrix completion problem and it can be solved by an iterative formula. For other cases, we propose both nuclear norm relaxation and moment relaxation methods for solving the resulting rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. The nuclear norm relaxation sometimes returns a rank-$1$ tensor completion, while sometimes it does not. When it fails, we apply the moment hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations to solve the rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. The moment hierarchy can always get a rank-$1$ tensor completion, or detect its nonexistence. Numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of these proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [{\it A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes.}, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We validate our numerical method on several canonical problems including the method of manufactured solutions. We also present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>Consistent multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we notice that a pressure-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was established to recover the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE), which serve as the cornerstone of various fluid-solid multiphase models. It decouples the pressure from density and exhibits excellent numerical performance, however, the widely adopted density-based LB scheme still suffers from significant spurious velocities and inconsistency with VANSE. To remedy this issue, a multiple-relaxation-time LB method is devised in this work, which incorporates a provisional equation of state in an adjusted density equilibrium distribution to decouple the void fraction from density. The Galilean invariance of the recovered VANSE is guaranteed by introducing a penalty source term in moment space, effectively eliminating unwanted numerical errors. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis and detailed numerical validations, this novel method is proved to be capable of recovering VANSE with second-order accuracy consistently, and well-suited for handling void fraction fields with large gradients and spatiotemporal distributions.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with applications in numerical approximations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>
