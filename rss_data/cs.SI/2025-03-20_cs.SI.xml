      <title>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior and Information Spreading on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of coordinated users (i.e., users characterized by an unexpected, suspicious, or exceptional similarity) in information spreading on Twitter by quantifying the efficacy of their tactics in deceiving feed algorithms to maximize information outreach. In particular, we investigate the behavior of coordinated accounts within a large set of retweet-based information cascades identifying key differences between coordinated and non-coordinated accounts in terms of position within the cascade, action delay and outreach. On average, coordinated accounts occupy higher positions of the information cascade (i.e., closer to the root), spread messages faster and involve a slightly higher number of users. When considering cascade metrics such as size, number of edges and height, we observe clear differences among information cascades that are associated to a systematically larger proportion of coordinated accounts, as confirmed by comparisons with statistical null models. To further characterize the activity of coordinated accounts we introduce two new measures capturing their infectivity within the information cascade (i.e., their ability to involve other users) and their interaction with non-coordinated accounts. Finally, we find that the interaction pattern between the two classes of users follows a saturation-like process. A larger-scale targeting of non-coordinated users does not require a larger amount of coordinated accounts after a threshold value approximately 50%, after which involving more coordinated accounts within a cascade yields a null marginal effect. Our results contribute to shed light on the role of coordinated accounts and their effect on information diffusion.</description>

      <title>A two-stage model leveraging friendship network for community evolution prediction in interactive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive networks representing user participation and interactions in specific "events" are highly dynamic, with communities reflecting collective behaviors that evolve over time. Predicting these community evolutions is crucial for forecasting the trajectory of the related "event". Some models for community evolution prediction have been witnessed, but they primarily focused on coarse-grained evolution types (e.g., expand, dissolve, merge, split), often neglecting fine-grained evolution extents (e.g., the extent of community expansion). Furthermore, these models typically utilize only one network data (here is interactive network data) for dynamic community featurization, overlooking the more stable friendship network that represents the friendships between people to enrich community representations. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage model that predicts both the type and extent of community evolution. Our model unifies multi-class classification for evolution type and regression for evolution extent within a single framework and fuses data from both interactive and friendship networks for a comprehensive community featurization. We also introduce a hybrid strategy to differentiate between evolution types that are difficult to distinguish. Experimental results on three datasets show the significant superiority of the proposed model over other models, confirming its efficacy in predicting community evolution in interactive networks.</description>

      <title>Affective Polarization Amongst Swedish Politicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates affective polarization among Swedish politicians on Twitter from 2021 to 2023, including the September 2022 parliamentary election. Analyzing over 25,000 tweets and employing large language models (LLMs) for sentiment and political classification, we distinguish between positive partisanship (support of allies) and negative partisanship (criticism of opponents).
  Our findings are contingent on the definition of the in-group. When political in-groups are defined at the ideological bloc level, negative and positive partisanship occur at similar rates. However, when the in-group is defined at the party level, negative partisanship becomes significantly more dominant and is 1.51 times more likely (1.45, 1.58). This effect is even stronger among extreme politicians, who engage in negativity more than their moderate counterparts. Negative partisanship also proves to be a strategic choice for online visibility, attracting 3.18 more likes and 1.69 more retweets on average.
  By adapting methods developed for two-party systems and leveraging LLMs for Swedish-language analysis, we provide novel insights into how multiparty politics shapes polarizing discourse. Our results underscore both the strategic appeal of negativity in digital spaces and the growing potential of LLMs for large-scale, non-English political research.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation Tool for Backbone Extraction Techniques in Weighted Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are essential for analyzing complex systems. However, their growing size necessitates backbone extraction techniques aimed at reducing their size while retaining critical features. In practice, selecting, implementing, and evaluating the most suitable backbone extraction method may be challenging. This paper introduces netbone, a Python package designed for assessing the performance of backbone extraction techniques in weighted networks. Its comparison framework is the standout feature of netbone. Indeed, the tool incorporates state-of-the-art backbone extraction techniques. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics allowing users to evaluate different backbones techniques. We illustrate the flexibility and effectiveness of netbone through the US air transportation network analysis. We compare the performance of different backbone extraction techniques using the evaluation metrics. We also show how users can integrate a new backbone extraction method into the comparison framework. netbone is publicly available as an open-source tool, ensuring its accessibility to researchers and practitioners. Promoting standardized evaluation practices contributes to the advancement of backbone extraction techniques and fosters reproducibility and comparability in research efforts. We anticipate that netbone will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners enabling them to make informed decisions when selecting backbone extraction techniques to gain insights into the structural and functional properties of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Crowd-PrefRL: Preference-Based Reward Learning from Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train AI agents using human feedback through preferences over pairs of behaviors, enabling agents to learn desired behaviors when it is difficult to specify a numerical reward function. While this paradigm leverages human feedback, it typically treats the feedback as given by a single human user. However, different users may desire multiple AI behaviors and modes of interaction. Meanwhile, incorporating preference feedback from crowds (i.e. ensembles of users) in a robust manner remains a challenge, and the problem of training RL agents using feedback from multiple human users remains understudied. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework, Crowd-PrefRL, that integrates preference-based RL approaches with techniques from unsupervised crowdsourcing to enable training of autonomous system behaviors from crowdsourced feedback. We show preliminary results suggesting that Crowd-PrefRL can learn reward functions and agent policies from preference feedback provided by crowds of unknown expertise and reliability. We also show that in most cases, agents trained with Crowd-PrefRL outperform agents trained with majority-vote preferences or preferences from any individual user, especially when the spread of user error rates among the crowd is large. Results further suggest that our method can identify the presence of minority viewpoints within the crowd in an unsupervised manner.</description>

      <title>BicliqueEncoder: An Efficient Method for Link Prediction in Bipartite Networks using Formal Concept Analysis and Transformer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient method for link prediction in bipartite networks, using \textit{formal concept analysis} (FCA) and the Transformer encoder. Link prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains such as product recommendation in online sales, and prediction of chemical-disease interaction in medical science. Since for link prediction, the topological structure of a network contains valuable information, many approaches focus on extracting structural features and then utilizing them for link prediction. Bi-cliques, as a type of structural feature of bipartite graphs, can be utilized for link prediction. Although several link prediction methods utilizing bi-cliques have been proposed and perform well in rather small datasets, all of them face challenges with scalability when dealing with large datasets since they demand substantial computational resources. This limits the practical utility of these approaches in real-world applications. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a novel approach employing iceberg concept lattices and the Transformer encoder. Our method requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale datasets while maintaining high prediction performance. We conduct experiments on five large real-world datasets that exceed the capacity of previous bi-clique-based approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Additionally, we perform supplementary experiments on five small datasets to compare with the previous bi-clique-based methods for bipartite link prediction and demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the previous ones.</description>
