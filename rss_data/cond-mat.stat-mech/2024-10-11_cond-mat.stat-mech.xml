      <title>Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Transition-Path Times, Survival Probability, and First-Passage time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the propagator and the transition path time distribution of a two-dimensional active Brownian particle crossing a parabolic barrier with absorbing boundary conditions at both sides. Using the passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, our solution is expressed in terms of the perturbed eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the associated Fokker-Planck equation once the latter is reduced by taking into account only the coordinate along the direction of the barrier and the self-propulsion angle. We show that transition path times are typically shortened by the self-propulsion of the particle. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage time distribution, which display a strong dependence on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in anti-symmetric Lotka-Volterra doublet chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the emergence of topological phase transition in the minimal model of two dimensional rock-paper-scissors cycle in the form of a doublet chain. The evolutionary dynamics of the doublet chain is obtained by solving the anti-symmetric Lotka-Volterra equation. We show that the mass decays exponentially towards edges and robust against small perturbation in the rate of change of mass transfer, a signature of a topological phase. For one of the configuration of our doublet chain, the mass is transferred towards both edges and the bulk is gaped. Further, we confirm this phase transition within the framework of topological band theory. For this we calculate the winding number which change from zero to one for trivial and a non-trivial topological phases respectively.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Classical Thermodynamics from Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a reformulation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics by replacing the obscure and ambiguous concept of entropy with the clear and intuitive concept of information stored in a thermodynamic system. Specifically, we rewrite the laws of thermodynamics in the mathematical terminology borrowed from information theory with an emphasis on information instead of entropy and on binary logarithm instead of natural one. We also define a modified ideal gas constant denoted as $\mathcal{R}$ that quantifies the energy cost of storing or retrieving a mole of information. Moreover an application to the ideal gas is carried and new insight on the evolution of the system is acquired. This new formulation might serve as a basis to teaching thermodynamics, where one deals with the concept of energy and information both stored in a thermodynamic system and avoids the lack of cognitive representations inherent in the concept of entropy.</description>

      <title>Long-range correlations with finite-size effects from a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with power-law distributed durations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta\in[0,2]$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified. The emergence of the $1/f$ noise signature is motivated for a motion of coherent structures with fixed size and uniformly distributed velocities, which are shown to be equivalent to $P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^2$ distributed durations observed from a single location.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the spectral form factor (SFF) of the resulting circuit ensemble can be computed exactly without numerical sampling. In the case of the circular unitary ensemble (CUE) we report an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for arbitrary system sizes, and show that it grows through a sequence of exponential ramps. Using exact numerical methods, we find that the circular orthogonal and symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively) also lead to exponential growth of the SFF. This exponential growth is characteristic of non-interacting systems with random matrix statistics at the $\textit{single-particle}$ level and, upon introducing interactions, crosses over to a linear ramp consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-conserving dynamics of non-interacting fermions monitored by local charge measurements have been shown to possess in 1D space only an area-law-entangled phase, with no measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This phenomenon was elegantly explained by an effective replica field theory given by a non-linear sigma model featuring large replica symmetries. In this work, we focus on the charge-conserving monitored dynamics of interacting fermions in 1D. Using a unifying replica Keldysh field theory, we show that more dynamical phases and transitions emerge owing to the reduction of replica symmetry when interactions are introduced. The reduced symmetry combines a discrete replica permutation symmetry and the charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT between area-law and volume-law entanglement scalings, which can be described by a separatrix in the weak-coupling renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the Kosterlitz-Thouless type ``charge-sharpening" transition between the two kinds of dynamics where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the local measurements. All the relevant phases and transitions can be understood within the same unifying field theory. Additionally, this field theory provides insight into why the charge-sharpening transition should only happen in the presence of volume-law entanglement scaling. Moreover, we show that our field theory, despite being constructed using the Keldysh formalism, is equivalent to a statistical mechanics model that describes the (replicated) time-evolution of the system's density matrix mapped to a doubled Hilbert space under the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. This equivalence is the result of the trivialization of the fermion distribution function by measurement-induced heating effects.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>On criticality of interface depinning and origin of "bump" in the avalanche distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depinning transition critical point is manifested as power-law distributed avalanches exhibited by slowly driven elastic interfaces in quenched random media. Here we show that since avalanches with different starting heights relative to the mean interface height or different initial local interface curvatures experience different excess driving forces due to elasticity, avalanches close to the "global" critical point of non-mean field systems can be separated into populations of subcritical, critical and supercritical ones. The asymmetric interface height distribution results in an excess of supercritical avalanches, manifested as a "bump" in the avalanche size distribution cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a systematic analysis of the properties of entanglement entropy in curved backgrounds using the replica approach. We explore the analytic $(q-1)$ expansion of R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ and its variations; our setup applies to generic variations, from symmetry transformations to variations of the background metric or entangling region. Our methodology elegantly reproduces and generalises results from the literature on entanglement entropy in different dimensions, backgrounds, and states. We use our analytic expansions to explore the behaviour of entanglement entropy in static black hole backgrounds under specific scaling transformations, and we explain why this behaviour is key to determining whether there are islands of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic toolbox for quantum dynamics with tunable noise strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that allows for the exact analytic treatment of quantum dynamics subject to coherent noise. The noise is modeled via unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian drawn from a random-matrix ensemble for arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension $N$. While the methods we develop apply to generic such ensembles with a notion of rotation invariance, we focus largely on the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). Averaging over the ensemble of ''noisy'' Hamiltonians produces an effective quantum channel, the properties of which are analytically calculable and determined by the spectral form factors of the relevant ensemble. We compute spectral form factors of the GUE exactly for any finite $N$, along with the corresponding GUE quantum channel, and its variance. Key advantages of our approach include the ability to access exact analytic results for any $N$ and the ability to tune to the noise-free limit (in contrast, e.g., to the Haar ensemble), and analytic access to moments beyond the variance. We also highlight some unusual features of the GUE channel, including the nonmonotonicity of the coefficients of various operators as a function of noise strength and the failure to saturate the Haar-random limit, even with infinite noise strength.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics in the Fractional Quantum Hall Regime of Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively. The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 15 exactly solvable inhomogeneous (spinless) fermion systems on one-dimensional lattices are constructed explicitly based on the discrete orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, e.g. the Krawtchouk, Hahn, Racah, Meixner, $q$-Racah polynomials. The Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg equations are solved explicitly, as the entire set of the eigenvalues and eigenstates are known explicitly. The ground state two point correlation functions are derived explicitly. The multi point correlation functions are obtained by Wick's Theorem. Corresponding 15 exactly solvable XX spin systems are also displayed. They all have nearest neighbour interactions. The exact solvability of Schr\"odinger equation means that of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. This leads to 15 exactly solvable Birth and Death fermions and 15 Birth and Death spin models. These provide plenty of materials for calculating interesting quantities, e.g. entanglement entropy, etc.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color laser driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we unifiedly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense laser (non-perturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the spatial symmetry of the laser-field trajectory. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zero-th order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift or injection current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multiple-color laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Phase-Field Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale microstructure evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no bottom-up theory available that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. By introducing a molecular coarse-grained system as an intermediate step, we demonstrate the approach on the example of ice nucleation dynamics, with a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models, systematically bridging the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Body and mind: Decoding the dynamics of pedestrians and the effect of smartphone distraction by coupling mechanical and decisional processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pedestrians are able to anticipate, which gives them an edge in avoiding collisions and navigating in cluttered spaces. However, these capabilities are impaired by digital distraction through smartphones, a growing safety concern. To capture these features, we put forward a continuous agent-based model (dubbed ANDA) hinging on a transparent delineation of a decision-making process, wherein a desired velocity is selected as the optimum of a perceived cost, and a mechanical layer that handles contacts and collisions. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen parameters, many of which are fit using independent experimental data. The versatility of ANDA is demonstrated by numerical simulations that successfully replicate empirical observations in a very wide range of scenarios. These scenarios vary from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents, to collective flow properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings, and to the dynamics of evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible. Remarkably, the model is able to replicate the enhanced chaoticity of the flow observed experimentally in 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, replicating the digital distraction effect. The conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin of its current limitations and to clarify the singular position of pedestrian crowds amid active-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Search with stochastic home-returns can expedite classical first passage under resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical first passage under resetting is a paradigm in the search process. Despite its multitude of applications across interdisciplinary sciences, experimental realizations of such resetting processes posit practical challenges in calibrating these zero time irreversible transitions. Here, we consider a strategy in which resetting is performed using finite time return protocols in lieu of instantaneous returns. These controls could also be accompanied with random fluctuations or errors allowing target detection even during the return phase. To better understand the phenomena, we develop a unified renewal approach that can encapsulate arbitrary search processes centered around home in a fairly general topography containing targets, various resetting times and return mechanisms in arbitrary dimensions. While such finite-time protocols would apparently seem to prolong the overall search time in comparison to the instantaneous resetting process, we show \textit{on the contrary} that a significant speed-up can be gained by leveraging the stochasticity in home-returns. The formalism is then explored to reveal a universal criterion distilling the benefits of this strategy. We demonstrate how this general principle can be utilized to improve overall performance of a one-dimensional diffusive search process reinforced with experimentally feasible parameters. We believe that such strategies designed with inherent randomness can be made optimal with precise controllability in complex search processes.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Profligacy of Searches with Reset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the profligacy of a search process as a competition between its expected cost and the probability of finding the target. The arbiter of the competition is a parameter $\lambda$ that represents how much a searcher invests into increasing the chance of success. Minimizing the profligacy with respect to the search strategy specifies the optimal search. We show that in the case of diffusion with stochastic resetting, the amount of resetting in the optimal strategy has a highly nontrivial dependence on model parameters resulting in classical continuous transitions, discontinuous transitions and tricritical points as well as non-standard discontinuous transitions exhibiting re-entrant behavior and overhangs.</description>

      <title>Exponential growth rate of lattice comb polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a lattice model of comb polymers and derive bounds on the exponential growth rate of the number of embeddings of the comb. A comb is composed of a backbone that is a self-avoiding walk and a set of $t$ teeth, also modelled as mutually and self-avoiding walks, attached to the backbone at vertices or nodes of degree 3. Each tooth of the comb has $m_a$ edges and there are $m_b$ edges in the backbone between adjacent degree 3 vertices and between the first and last nodes of degree 3 and the end vertices of degree 1 of the backbone. We are interested in the exponential growth rate as $t \to \infty$ with $m_a$ and $m_b$ fixed. We prove upper bounds on this growth rate and show that for small values of $m_a$ the growth rate is strictly less than that of self-avoiding walks.</description>

      <title>Robust Finite-Temperature Many-Body Scarring on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanisms for suppressing thermalization in disorder-free many-body systems, such as Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest in foundations of quantum statistical physics and potential quantum information processing applications. However, their sensitivity to realistic effects such as finite temperature remains largely unexplored. Here, we have utilized IBM's Kolkata quantum processor to demonstrate an unexpected robustness of quantum many-body scars at finite temperatures when the system is prepared in a thermal Gibbs ensemble. We identify such robustness in the PXP model, which describes quantum many-body scars in experimental systems of Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold atoms in tilted Bose--Hubbard optical lattices. By contrast, other theoretical models which host exact quantum many-body scars are found to lack such robustness, and their scarring properties quickly decay with temperature. Our study sheds light on the important differences between scarred models in terms of their algebraic structures, which impacts their resilience to finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Learning from higher-order statistics, efficiently: hypothesis tests, random features, and neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks excel at discovering statistical patterns in high-dimensional data sets. In practice, higher-order cumulants, which quantify the non-Gaussian correlations between three or more variables, are particularly important for the performance of neural networks. But how efficient are neural networks at extracting features from higher-order cumulants? We study this question in the spiked cumulant model, where the statistician needs to recover a privileged direction or "spike" from the order-$p\ge 4$ cumulants of $d$-dimensional inputs. Existing literature established the presence of a wide statistical-to-computational gap in this problem. We deepen this line of work by finding an exact formula for the likelihood ratio norm which proves that statistical distinguishability requires $n\gtrsim d$ samples, while distinguishing the two distributions in polynomial time requires $n \gtrsim d^2$ samples for a wide class of algorithms, i.e. those covered by the low-degree conjecture. Numerical experiments show that neural networks do indeed learn to distinguish the two distributions with quadratic sample complexity, while "lazy" methods like random features are not better than random guessing in this regime. Our results show that neural networks extract information from higher-ordercorrelations in the spiked cumulant model efficiently, and reveal a large gap in the amount of data required by neural networks and random features to learn from higher-order cumulants.</description>

Abstract: We study the effective stochastic dynamics of a semiclassical probe induced by linear optomechanical interactions with a quantum oscillator. Quantum fluctuations lead to state-dependent non-equilibrium noise, which is exponentially enhanced by wavepacket delocalization. For the case of nanoparticles coupled by the Coulomb interaction such noise can imprint potentially measurable signatures in multiparticle levitation experiments. Quantum-induced optomechanical fluctuations hold strong analogy to quantum gravitational wave noise and interconnect stochastic thermodynamics, graviton physics and the detection of gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which significantly extends a previous approach in a specific noise model to arbitrary noisy models. In our constructions, it is crucial to use the QSVT-based FPAA, demonstrating for the first time the separation between any other amplitude amplification algorithms and the QSVT-based one in the application. We also show that the proposed decoders have high decoding performance and reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. Specifically, when the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as the unique steady state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of external forcing, all trajectories on the phase plane of the van der Pol oscillator tend to a closed, periodic, trajectory -- the limit cycle -- after infinite time. Here, we drive the van der Pol oscillator with an external time-dependent force to reach the limit cycle in a given finite time. Specifically, we are interested in minimising the non-conservative contribution to the work when driving the system from a given initial point on the phase plane to any final point belonging to the limit cycle. There appears a speed limit inequality, which expresses a trade-off between the connection time and cost -- in terms of the non-conservative work. We show how the above results can be { generalized to the broader family of non-linear oscillators given by} the Li\'enard equation. Finally, we also look into the problem of minimising the total work done by the external force.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and pole/cut structure in retarded correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to discuss the following two questions:
  Q1. Mathematical justification of the model of relaxation time approximation (RTA);
  Q2. Pole/cut structure in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description.
  We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Furthermore, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived non-analytical structures in this case. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenspectrum leads to dominant long-lived branch-cuts. When particles are massive or the perturbations are inhomogeneous, the non-analytical structures become more complex and richer.</description>

Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and highly efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. The algorithm enables orders of magnitude speed up in comparison to other methods. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>
