      <title>Band-unknotting numbers and connected sums of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the band-unknotting number $u_{nb}(K)$ of a knot $K$, and how it behaves with respect to connect sums. We show that this sub-additive function is not additive under connected sums, by finding infinitely many examples of knots $K_1, K_2$ with $u_{nb}(K_1\#K_2) &lt; u_{nb}(K_1) + u_{nb}(K_2)$. Even more surprisingly, there are infinitely many examples of knots $K_1, K_2$ such that $u_{nb}(K_1\#K_2) &lt; u_{nb}(K_i)$, $i=1,2$. Our work is motivated by the recent analogous results for the Gordian unknotting number by Brittenham and Hermiller \cite{BrittenhamHermiller}.
  We also prove new lower and upper bounds on the topological and smooth non-orientable 4-genus of a knot $K$.</description>

      <title>Knots in $S_{g} \times S^{1}$, their essential diagrams and virtual knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Kim} it is shown that knots in $S_{g} \times S^{1}$ can be presented by virtual diagrams with a decoration, so called, {\em double lines}. In this paper, we study the essential diagram for each knot in $S_{g} \times S^{1}$, which has the minimal number of double lines. We prove that virtual knot theory is embedded in the theory of knots in $S_{g}\times S^{1}$. In the same time, one can obtain knots in $S^{2}\times S^{1}$ from 2-component links $L = K\sqcup T$ where $T$ is a trivial knot. By using knots in $S^{2} \times S^{1}$, we study the minimality and separability of such classical links.</description>

      <title>A Simple Construction of Lefschetz Fibrations on Compact Stein Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loi-Piergallini, Akbulut-Ozbagci, and Akbulut-Arikan showed that every compact Stein surface admits a positive allowable Lefschetz fibration over the disk $D^2$ with bounded fibers (PALF in short), and they provided constructions of PALF's corresponding to compact Stein surfaces.
  In this paper, we present a simple method for constructing a PALF from a 2-handlebody decomposition of any given compact Stein surface. Our method yields PALF's whose regular fibers have small genus, and it provides an alternative constructive proof of the above result.
  We also define the minimal genus of a regular fiber of a PALF on the knot trace of a knot $K$ with framing one less than its maximal Thurston-Bennequin number as an invariant of $K$. When the grid number of $K$ is $N$, our construction produces a PALF whose regular fiber has genus at most $(N - 1)/2$, showing that the defined invariant is bounded above by $(N - 1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quadratic $\mathbb{R}$-Algebraic sets in $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The images of a ball under complex linear transformations are complex ellipsoids. So, they are the unit balls of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces over the complex numbers. The analog of segments in the real line, are discs in the complex line. So, the analog of convex bodies in $\mathbb R^n$ should be what we called ``\emph{bombons}'' in $\mathbb C^n$: bodies whose non-trivial sections with complex lines are disks. Clearly, a complex ellipsoid is a bombon in this sense. We first introduced bombons in \cite{ABM1} motivated by our study of the complex Banach conjecture \cite{BM}; A little later, they turned out to be an unexpected characterization of complex ellipsoids with no analog over the real numbers. Namely, if every complex line that intersects a convex body in $\mathbb C^n$ does so in a disk or a point, then the convex body is a complex ellipsoid. This characterization naturally leads to the main question of this paper. What are those closed sets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with the property that any complex line that intersects them does so either at a single point, at the boundary of a complex disk, or along the entire line?</description>

      <title>On $\pi_1$-injectivity of self-maps in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all self-maps of non-zero degree of $3$-manifolds not covered by $S^3$ and of Thurston geometric $4$-manifolds and their connected sums not covered by $N\#(\#_{p\geq0}S^2\times S^2)\#(\#_{q\geq0}\mathbb C P^2)$, where $N$ is an $S^2\times\mathbb X^2$ or $S^3\times\mathbb R$ manifold, are $\pi_1$-injective. We thus determine when these maps induce $\pi_1$-isomorphisms. The results in dimension three were previously established by Shicheng Wang. We give a uniform group theoretic proof in all cases based only on the residual finiteness of the fundamental groups for the $\pi_1$-injectivity and then only on numerical invariants for the $\pi_1$-isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The topology of local quaternionic toric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the topology of manifolds equipped with a local quaternionic toric action modeled on the regular representation of the quaternionic torus $Q^n=(S^3)^n$. Building on our previous work, where the toric, differential and tetraplectic foundations were established, we show that the global topology of such manifolds is determined by the orbit space and its characteristic data. We construct Leray--Serre and Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequences for the orbit projection, yielding explicit descriptions of the cohomology and $K$-theory of manifolds equipped with local quaternionic toric actions. In dimension four, we develop a quaternionic analogue of the Meyer signature formula and we briefly outline an $L$-theoretic interpretation of the resulting signature invariants. These results extend the methods of the classical (complex) toric topology to the quaternionic setting.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for the Hecke representation of the braid group, and applications to the computation of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and the search for interesting braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knot theory is an active field of mathematics, in which combinatorial and computational methods play an important role. One side of computational knot theory, that has gained interest in recent years, both for complexity analysis and practical algorithms, is quantum topology and the computation of topological invariants issued from the theory.
  In this article, we leverage the rigidity brought by the representation-theoretic origins of the quantum invariants for algorithmic purposes. We do so by exploiting braids and the algebraic properties of the braid group to describe, analyze, and implement a fast algorithm to compute the Hecke representation of the braid group. We apply this construction to design a parameterized algorithm to compute the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of knots, and demonstrate its interest experimentally. Finally, we combine our fast Hecke representation algorithm with Garside theory, to implement a reservoir sampling search and find non-trivial braids with trivial Hecke representations with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. We find several such braids, in particular proving that the Hecke representation of $B_5$ with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients is non-faithful, a previously unknown fact.</description>

      <title>Secondary Stiefel-Whitney numbers and corresponding cobordism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every relation $R$ between Stiefel-Whitney numbers of closed $(n+1)$-manifolds we consider an associated invariant $\varkappa_R$ of null-cobordant $n$-manifolds with a certain additional structure. For $n=2k-1$ and $R = w_{n+1}+v_k^2$ the invariant $\varkappa_R$ equals the Kervaire semi-characteristic. In addition, we construct the cobordism group $\Omega_n^R$, which extends the unoriented cobordism group $\Omega_n^O$. We show that $\varkappa_R$ is a complete invariant of $R$-cobordism classes of null-cobordant $n$-manifolds. We prove that our invariant $\varkappa_R$ and $R$-cobordism class of manifold are quadratic in the sense of Gusarov-Vassiliev-Podkorytov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brouwer homeomorphisms are fixed-point-free, orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the plane. In recent years, their dynamics have been mostly studied through two complementary approaches, one introduced by Handel and the other by Le Calvez, each offering a distinct perspective on the behavior of Brouwer homeomorphisms. In this work, we present a unified framework that allows Le Calvez's foliated methods to recover, and in some cases improve, the classical results of Handel's theory.</description>

      <title>Decidability of equations and first-order theory in Seifert 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1405.6274, Question 5.2 &amp; Question 5.3] Aschenbrenner, Friedl and Wilton ask: (1) Is the equation problem solvable for the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold? and (2) Is the first-order theory of the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold decidable? In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry.</description>

      <title>Normal closure of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ and $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $n\geq 3$, let $G$ be a nontrivial finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ with $|G|$ not a power of $2$. We prove that the normal closure $N(G)$ is $\mathrm{SAut}(F_n)$ if $G\subset\mathrm{SAut}(F_n)$ and $N(G)$ is $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ otherwise. When $|G|$ is a power of $2$, we have a partial theorem. Similarly, let $G'$ be a nontrivial finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ with $|G'|$ not a power of $2$. Then the normal closure $N(G')$ is $\mathrm{SOut}(F_n)$ if $G'\subset\mathrm{SOut}(F_n)$ and $N(G')$ is $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ otherwise. When $|G'|$ is a power of $2$, we have a partial theorem as well.</description>

      <title>Geometric universal Jones invariant from configurations on ovals in the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct geometrically a universal Jones invariant as a limit of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. For any fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define a new knot invariant, called ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' globalising topologically all coloured Jones polynomials at levels less than $\mathscr N$. It is defined via the intersection points between {Lagrangian submanifolds} supported on arcs and ovals in the disc. The geometry of these Lagrangians is novel: previous topological models involved immersed submanifolds rather than embedded ones. We do this by defining a new local system that refines the Lawrence representation, and depends of the distribution of multiplicities of points in the configuration space on the ovals.
  On the algebraic side, Habiro's famous invariant for knots \cite{H3} is a universal invariant globalising the family of coloured Jones polynomials. He conjectured that this universal invariant recovers also the ADO invariant divided by the Alexander polynomials, which was proved by Willetts \cite{W} in a version of Habiro's ring (\cite{H2}). The universal Jones invariant that we construct belongs to a different ring that comes with a map to Habiro's ring \cite{H2}.
  We prove that our invariant recovers this version of Habiro's invariant. The difference is that our invariant is given as a limit of new knot invariants, the $\mathscr N^{th}$ unified Jones invariants. These invariants in turn provide a geometrical understanding of sets of all coloured Jones polynomials of bounded colour, collecting more information as we increase the colour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the first known topological model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial constructed directly from link diagrams. More precisely, we prove that this invariant is given by graded intersections between explicit Lagrangian submanifolds in a fixed configuration space on a Heegaard surface for the link exterior. The submanifolds are supported on a collection of arcs and ovals on the Heegaard surface. We also obtain two topological models for the Jones polynomial via a Heegaard surface associated to a link diagram. This opens up new avenues for constructing categorifications for the Jones and the HOMFLY-PT polynomials of a geometric nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two main approaches to building locally flat embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds: direct methods which geometrically manipulate a given map of a surface, and more indirect methods using surgery theory. Both rely on Freedman-Quinn's disc embedding theorem. In this expository article, we give an introduction to these methods by sketching proofs of the following results: every primitive second homology class in a closed, simply connected 4-manifold is represented by a locally flat embedded torus (Lee-Wilczynski); and every Alexander polynomial one knot in $S^3$ is topologically slice (Freedman-Quinn).</description>

Abstract: We construct geometrically two universal link invariants: universal ADO invariant and universal Jones invariant, as limits of invariants given by graded intersections in configuration spaces. More specifically, for a fixed level $\mathscr N$, we define new link invariants: ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Jones invariant'' and ``$\mathscr N^{th}$ Unified Alexander invariant''. They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc.
  The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non semi-simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants.</description>

      <title>Topology and Algebra of Bonded Knots and Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed study of \emph{bonded knots} and their related structures, integrating recent developments into a single framework. Bonded knots are classical knots endowed with embedded bonding arcs modeling physical or chemical bonds. We consider bonded knots in three categories (long, standard, and tight) according to the type of bonds, and in two categories, topological vertex and rigid vertex, according to the allowed isotopy moves, and we define invariants for each category. We then develop the theory of \emph{bonded braids}, the algebraic counterpart of bonded knots. We define the {\it bonded braid monoid}, with its generators and relations, and formulate the analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems for bonded braids, including an $L$-equivalence for bonded braids. Next, we introduce \emph{enhanced bonded knots and braids}, incorporating two types of bonds (attracting and repelling) corresponding to different interactions. We define the enhanced bonded braid group and show how the bonded braid monoid embeds into this group. Finally, we study \emph{bonded knotoids}, which are open knot diagrams with bonds, and their closure operations, and we define the \emph{bonded closure}. We introduce \emph{bonded braidoids} as the algebraic counterpart of bonded knotoids. These models capture the topology of open chains with inter and intra-chain bonds and suggest new invariants for classifying biological macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>On Fico's Lemmata and the Homotopy Type of Certain Gyrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake to determine the homotopy type of gyrations of sphere products and of connected sums, thereby generalising results known in earlier literature as ''Fico's Lemmata'' which underpin gyrations in their original formulation from geometric topology. We provide applications arising from recasting these results into the modern homotopy theoretic setting.</description>
