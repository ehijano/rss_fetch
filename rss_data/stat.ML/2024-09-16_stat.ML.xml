      <title>Towards Definition of Higher Order Causality in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical guarantees in KL for Diffusion Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) (also referred to as stochastic interpolants or rectified flows) stands out as a class of generative models that aims to bridge in finite time the target distribution $\nu^\star$ with an auxiliary distribution $\mu$, leveraging a fixed coupling $\pi$ and a bridge which can either be deterministic or stochastic. These two ingredients define a path measure which can then be approximated by learning the drift of its Markovian projection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide relatively mild assumptions on $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$ to obtain non-asymptotics guarantees for Diffusion Flow Matching (DFM) models using as bridge the conditional distribution associated with the Brownian motion. More precisely, we establish bounds on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the one generated by such DFM models under moment conditions on the score of $\nu^\star$, $\mu$ and $\pi$, and a standard $L^2$-drift-approximation error assumption.</description>

      <title>Federated One-Shot Ensemble Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster analysis across multiple institutions poses significant challenges due to data-sharing restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Federated One-shot Ensemble Clustering (FONT) algorithm, a novel solution tailored for multi-site analyses under such constraints. FONT requires only a single round of communication between sites and ensures privacy by exchanging only fitted model parameters and class labels. The algorithm combines locally fitted clustering models into a data-adaptive ensemble, making it broadly applicable to various clustering techniques and robust to differences in cluster proportions across sites. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of the data-adaptive weights learned by FONT, and simulation studies demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmark methods. We applied FONT to identify subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis across two health systems, revealing improved consistency of patient clusters across sites, while locally fitted clusters proved less transferable. FONT is particularly well-suited for real-world applications with stringent communication and privacy constraints, offering a scalable and practical solution for multi-site clustering.</description>

      <title>Optimal Classification-based Anomaly Detection with Neural Networks: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem in many application areas, such as network security. Many deep learning methods for unsupervised anomaly detection produce good empirical performance but lack theoretical guarantees. By casting anomaly detection into a binary classification problem, we establish non-asymptotic upper bounds and a convergence rate on the excess risk on rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks trained on synthetic anomalies. Our convergence rate on the excess risk matches the minimax optimal rate in the literature. Furthermore, we provide lower and upper bounds on the number of synthetic anomalies that can attain this optimality. For practical implementation, we relax some conditions to improve the search for the empirical risk minimizer, which leads to competitive performance to other classification-based methods for anomaly detection. Overall, our work provides the first theoretical guarantees of unsupervised neural network-based anomaly detectors and empirical insights on how to design them well.</description>

      <title>Think Twice Before You Act: Improving Inverse Problem Solving With MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as a strong prior for solving inverse problems. A prominent example is Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), which approximates the posterior distribution of data given the measure using Tweedie's formula. Despite the merits of being versatile in solving various inverse problems without re-training, the performance of DPS is hindered by the fact that this posterior approximation can be inaccurate especially for high noise levels. Therefore, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}osterior \textbf{MC}MC (\textbf{DPMC}), a novel inference algorithm based on Annealed MCMC to solve inverse problems with pretrained diffusion models. We define a series of intermediate distributions inspired by the approximated conditional distributions used by DPS. Through annealed MCMC sampling, we encourage the samples to follow each intermediate distribution more closely before moving to the next distribution at a lower noise level, and therefore reduce the accumulated error along the path. We test our algorithm in various inverse problems, including super resolution, Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, inpainting, and phase retrieval. Our algorithm outperforms DPS with less number of evaluations across nearly all tasks, and is competitive among existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi forests: Variable importance for multi-class outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prediction tasks with multi-class outcomes, identifying covariates specifically associated with one or more outcome classes can be important. Conventional variable importance measures (VIMs) from random forests (RFs), like permutation and Gini importance, focus on overall predictive performance or node purity, without differentiating between the classes. Therefore, they can be expected to fail to distinguish class-associated covariates from covariates that only distinguish between groups of classes. We introduce a VIM called multi-class VIM, tailored for identifying exclusively class-associated covariates, via a novel RF variant called multi forests (MuFs). The trees in MuFs use both multi-way and binary splitting. The multi-way splits generate child nodes for each class, using a split criterion that evaluates how well these nodes represent their respective classes. This setup forms the basis of the multi-class VIM, which measures the discriminatory ability of the splits performed in the respective covariates with regard to this split criterion. Alongside the multi-class VIM, we introduce a second VIM, the discriminatory VIM. This measure, based on the binary splits, assesses the strength of the general influence of the covariates, irrespective of their class-associatedness. Simulation studies demonstrate that the multi-class VIM specifically ranks class-associated covariates highly, unlike conventional VIMs which also rank other types of covariates highly. Analyses of 121 datasets reveal that MuFs often have slightly lower predictive performance compared to conventional RFs. This is, however, not a limiting factor given the algorithm's primary purpose of calculating the multi-class VIM.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Clustering via the Proper Bayesian Bootstrap: the Bayesian Bagged Clustering (BBC) algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised techniques in the field of clustering. A new method is proposed to enhance existing literature models using the proper Bayesian bootstrap to improve results in terms of robustness and interpretability. Our approach is organized in two steps: k-means clustering is used for prior elicitation, then proper Bayesian bootstrap is applied as resampling method in an ensemble clustering approach. Results are analyzed introducing measures of uncertainty based on Shannon entropy. The proposal provides clear indication on the optimal number of clusters, as well as a better representation of the clustered data. Empirical results are provided on simulated data showing the methodological and empirical advances obtained.</description>

      <title>Model-independent variable selection via the rule-based variable priorit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While achieving high prediction accuracy is a fundamental goal in machine learning, an equally important task is finding a small number of features with high explanatory power. One popular selection technique is permutation importance, which assesses a variable's impact by measuring the change in prediction error after permuting the variable. However, this can be problematic due to the need to create artificial data, a problem shared by other methods as well. Another problem is that variable selection methods can be limited by being model-specific. We introduce a new model-independent approach, Variable Priority (VarPro), which works by utilizing rules without the need to generate artificial data or evaluate prediction error. The method is relatively easy to use, requiring only the calculation of sample averages of simple statistics, and can be applied to many data settings, including regression, classification, and survival. We investigate the asymptotic properties of VarPro and show, among other things, that VarPro has a consistent filtering property for noise variables. Empirical studies using synthetic and real-world data show the method achieves a balanced performance and compares favorably to many state-of-the-art procedures currently used for variable selection.</description>

      <title>Foundation of Calculating Normalized Maximum Likelihood for Continuous Probability Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code length is widely used as a model selection criterion based on the minimum description length principle, where the model with the shortest NML code length is selected. A common method to calculate the NML code length is to use the sum (for a discrete model) or integral (for a continuous model) of a function defined by the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator. While this method has been proven to correctly calculate the NML code length of discrete models, no proof has been provided for continuous cases. Consequently, it has remained unclear whether the method can accurately calculate the NML code length of continuous models. In this paper, we solve this problem affirmatively, proving that the method is also correct for continuous cases. Remarkably, completing the proof for continuous cases is non-trivial in that it cannot be achieved by merely replacing the sums in discrete cases with integrals, as the decomposition trick applied to sums in the discrete model case proof is not applicable to integrals in the continuous model case proof. To overcome this, we introduce a novel decomposition approach based on the coarea formula from geometric measure theory, which is essential to establishing our proof for continuous cases.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Multiclass Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multiclass classification for settings where data features $\mathbf{x}$ and their labels $\mathbf{y}$ are uncertain. We identify that distributionally robust one-vs-all (OVA) classifiers often struggle in settings with imbalanced data. To address this issue, we use Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization to develop a robust version of the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) characterized by the Crammer-Singer (CS) loss. First, we prove that the CS loss is bounded from above by a Lipschitz continuous function for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}$ and $\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}$, then we exploit strong duality results to express the dual of the worst-case risk problem, and we show that the worst-case risk minimization problem admits a tractable convex reformulation due to the regularity of the CS loss. Moreover, we develop a kernel version of our proposed model to account for nonlinear class separation, and we show that it admits a tractable convex upper bound. We also propose a projected subgradient method algorithm for a special case of our proposed linear model to improve scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the art OVA models in settings where the training data is highly imbalanced. We also show through experiments on popular real-world datasets that our proposed model often outperforms its regularized counterpart as the first accounts for uncertain labels unlike the latter.</description>

      <title>Introducing CausalBench: A Flexible Benchmark Framework for Causal Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While witnessing the exceptional success of machine learning (ML) technologies in many applications, users are starting to notice a critical shortcoming of ML: correlation is a poor substitute for causation. The conventional way to discover causal relationships is to use randomized controlled experiments (RCT); in many situations, however, these are impractical or sometimes unethical. Causal learning from observational data offers a promising alternative. While being relatively recent, causal learning aims to go far beyond conventional machine learning, yet several major challenges remain. Unfortunately, advances are hampered due to the lack of unified benchmark datasets, algorithms, metrics, and evaluation service interfaces for causal learning. In this paper, we introduce {\em CausalBench}, a transparent, fair, and easy-to-use evaluation platform, aiming to (a) enable the advancement of research in causal learning by facilitating scientific collaboration in novel algorithms, datasets, and metrics and (b) promote scientific objectivity, reproducibility, fairness, and awareness of bias in causal learning research. CausalBench provides services for benchmarking data, algorithms, models, and metrics, impacting the needs of a broad of scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-Based Test and Development Framework for Uncertainty Modeling in Level-Set Visualizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple comparative framework for testing and developing uncertainty modeling in uncertain marching cubes implementations. The selection of a model to represent the probability distribution of uncertain values directly influences the memory use, run time, and accuracy of an uncertainty visualization algorithm. We use an entropy calculation directly on ensemble data to establish an expected result and then compare the entropy from various probability models, including uniform, Gaussian, histogram, and quantile models. Our results verify that models matching the distribution of the ensemble indeed match the entropy. We further show that fewer bins in nonparametric histogram models are more effective whereas large numbers of bins in quantile models approach data accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improved Finite-Particle Convergence Rates for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernel Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is the observation that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, providing a near optimal double exponential improvement over the recent result by~\cite{shi2024finite}. Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow linearly in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws.</description>

      <title>Sub-graph Based Diffusion Model for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent a contemporary class of generative models with exceptional qualities in both synthesis and maximizing the data likelihood. These models work by traversing a forward Markov Chain where data is perturbed, followed by a reverse process where a neural network learns to undo the perturbations and recover the original data. There have been increasing efforts exploring the applications of DDPMs in the graph domain. However, most of them have focused on the generative perspective. In this paper, we aim to build a novel generative model for link prediction. In particular, we treat link prediction between a pair of nodes as a conditional likelihood estimation of its enclosing sub-graph. With a dedicated design to decompose the likelihood estimation process via the Bayesian formula, we are able to separate the estimation of sub-graph structure and its node features. Such designs allow our model to simultaneously enjoy the advantages of inductive learning and the strong generalization capability. Remarkably, comprehensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed method presents numerous advantages: (1) transferability across datasets without retraining, (2) promising generalization on limited training data, and (3) robustness against graph adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Causal GNNs: A GNN-Driven Instrumental Variable Approach for Causal Inference in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As network data applications continue to expand, causal inference within networks has garnered increasing attention. However, hidden confounders complicate the estimation of causal effects. Most methods rely on the strong ignorability assumption, which presumes the absence of hidden confounders-an assumption that is both difficult to validate and often unrealistic in practice. To address this issue, we propose CgNN, a novel approach that leverages network structure as instrumental variables (IVs), combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to mitigate hidden confounder bias and improve causal effect estimation. By utilizing network structure as IVs, we reduce confounder bias while preserving the correlation with treatment. Our integration of attention mechanisms enhances robustness and improves the identification of important nodes. Validated on two real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that CgNN effectively mitigates hidden confounder bias and offers a robust GNN-driven IV framework for causal inference in complex network data.</description>

      <title>Fair CoVariance Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariance-based data processing is widespread across signal processing and machine learning applications due to its ability to model data interconnectivities and dependencies. However, harmful biases in the data may become encoded in the sample covariance matrix and cause data-driven methods to treat different subpopulations unfairly. Existing works such as fair principal component analysis (PCA) mitigate these effects, but remain unstable in low sample regimes, which in turn may jeopardize the fairness goal. To address both biases and instability, we propose Fair coVariance Neural Networks (FVNNs), which perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix for both fair and accurate predictions. Our FVNNs provide a flexible model compatible with several existing bias mitigation techniques. In particular, FVNNs allow for mitigating the bias in two ways: first, they operate on fair covariance estimates that remove biases from their principal components; second, they are trained in an end-to-end fashion via a fairness regularizer in the loss function so that the model parameters are tailored to solve the task directly in a fair manner. We prove that FVNNs are intrinsically fairer than analogous PCA approaches thanks to their stability in low sample regimes. We validate the robustness and fairness of our model on synthetic and real-world data, showcasing the flexibility of FVNNs along with the tradeoff between fair and accurate performance.</description>

      <title>Batch Ensemble for Variance Dependent Regret in Stochastic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently trading off exploration and exploitation is one of the key challenges in online Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most works achieve this by carefully estimating the model uncertainty and following the so-called optimistic model. Inspired by practical ensemble methods, in this work we propose a simple and novel batch ensemble scheme that provably achieves near-optimal regret for stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB). Crucially, our algorithm has just a single parameter, namely the number of batches, and its value does not depend on distributional properties such as the scale and variance of the losses. We complement our theoretical results by demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation by Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) has shown remarkable success in uncertainty estimation. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and classification tasks. The limited OOD detection performance of EDL arises from its inability to reflect the distance between the testing example and training data when quantifying uncertainty, while its limited classification performance stems from its parameterization of the concentration parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning (DAEDL). DAEDL integrates the feature space density of the testing example with the output of EDL during the prediction stage, while using a novel parameterization that resolves the issues in the conventional parameterization. We prove that DAEDL enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties. DAEDL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks related to uncertainty estimation and classification</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The least squares (LS) estimate is the archetypical solution of linear regression problems. The asymptotic Gaussianity of the scaled LS error is often used to construct approximate confidence ellipsoids around the LS estimate, however, for finite samples these ellipsoids do not come with strict guarantees, unless some strong assumptions are made on the noise distributions. The paper studies the distribution-free Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm which can construct non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence ellipsoids under mild assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. These ellipsoids have the same center and orientation as the classical asymptotic ellipsoids, only their radii are different, which radii can be computed by convex optimization. Here, we establish high probability non-asymptotic upper bounds for the sizes of SPS outer ellipsoids for linear regression problems and show that the volumes of these ellipsoids decrease at the optimal rate. Finally, the difference between our theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of the regions are investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Matching: Fine-tuning Flow and Diffusion Generative Models with Memoryless Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there has not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism.

      <title>Event Detection in Time Series: Universal Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event detection in time series is a challenging task due to the prevalence of imbalanced datasets, rare events, and time interval-defined events. Traditional supervised deep learning methods primarily employ binary classification, where each time step is assigned a binary label indicating the presence or absence of an event. However, these methods struggle to handle these specific scenarios effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel supervised regression-based deep learning approach that offers several advantages over classification-based methods. Our approach, with a limited number of parameters, can effectively handle various types of events within a unified framework, including rare events and imbalanced datasets. We provide theoretical justifications for its universality and precision and demonstrate its superior performance across diverse domains, particularly for rare events and imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of the Central Mean Subspace via Smoothed Gradient Outer Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) for multi-index models. The estimators of the central mean subspace in prior works either have slow (non-parametric) convergence rates, or rely on stringent distributional conditions (e.g., the covariate distribution $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ being elliptical symmetric). In this paper, we show that a fast parametric convergence rate of form $C_d \cdot n^{-1/2}$ is achievable via estimating the \emph{expected smoothed gradient outer product}, for a general class of distribution $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ admitting Gaussian or heavier distributions. When the link function is a polynomial with a degree of at most $r$ and $P_{\mathbf{X}}$ is the standard Gaussian, we show that the prefactor depends on the ambient dimension $d$ as $C_d \propto d^r$.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Fair Federated Learning with Small Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As federated learning gains increasing importance in real-world applications due to its capacity for decentralized data training, addressing fairness concerns across demographic groups becomes critically important. However, most existing machine learning algorithms for ensuring fairness are designed for centralized data environments and generally require large-sample and distributional assumptions, underscoring the urgent need for fairness techniques adapted for decentralized and heterogeneous systems with finite-sample and distribution-free guarantees. To address this issue, this paper introduces FedFaiREE, a post-processing algorithm developed specifically for distribution-free fair learning in decentralized settings with small samples. Our approach accounts for unique challenges in decentralized environments, such as client heterogeneity, communication costs, and small sample sizes. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for both fairness and accuracy, and our experimental results further provide robust empirical validation for our proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Regression Problems with Tensor Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a tensor neural network (TNN) to address nonparametric regression problems, leveraging its distinct sub-network structure to effectively facilitate variable separation and enhance the approximation of complex, high-dimensional functions. The TNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBN) in terms of both approximation accuracy and generalization capacity, even with a comparable number of parameters. A significant innovation in our approach is the integration of statistical regression and numerical integration within the TNN framework. This allows for efficient computation of high-dimensional integrals associated with the regression function and provides detailed insights into the underlying data structure. Furthermore, we employ gradient and Laplacian analysis on the regression outputs to identify key dimensions influencing the predictions, thereby guiding the design of subsequent experiments. These advancements make TNN a powerful tool for applications requiring precise high-dimensional data analysis and predictive modeling.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian processes are arguably the most important class of spatiotemporal models within machine learning. They encode prior information about the modeled function and can be used for exact or approximate Bayesian learning. In many applications, particularly in physical sciences and engineering, but also in areas such as geostatistics and neuroscience, invariance to symmetries is one of the most fundamental forms of prior information one can consider. The invariance of a Gaussian process' covariance to such symmetries gives rise to the most natural generalization of the concept of stationarity to such spaces. In this work, we develop constructive and practical techniques for building stationary Gaussian processes on a very large class of non-Euclidean spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our techniques make it possible to (i) calculate covariance kernels and (ii) sample from prior and posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces, both in a practical manner. This work is split into two parts, each involving different technical considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while part II studies non-compact spaces possessing certain structure. Our contributions make the non-Euclidean Gaussian process models we study compatible with well-understood computational techniques available in standard Gaussian process software packages, thereby making them accessible to practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction in Wasserstein 1-distance with explicit rates is established for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with stochastic gradients under possibly nonconvex conditions. The algorithms considered include splitting schemes of kinetic Langevin diffusion commonly used in molecular dynamics simulations. To accommodate the degenerate noise structure corresponding to inertia existing in the chain, a characteristically discrete-in-time coupling and contraction proof is devised. As consequence, quantitative Gaussian concentration bounds are provided for empirical averages. Convergence in Wasserstein 2-distance and total variation are also given, together with numerical bias estimates.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>Four Facets of Forecast Felicity: Calibration, Predictiveness, Randomness and Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14483</link>

Abstract: Machine learning is about forecasting. Forecasts, however, obtain their usefulness only through their evaluation. Machine learning has traditionally focused on types of losses and their corresponding regret. Currently, the machine learning community regained interest in calibration. In this work, we show the conceptual equivalence of calibration and regret in evaluating forecasts. We frame the evaluation problem as a game between a forecaster, a gambler and nature. Putting intuitive restrictions on gambler and forecaster, calibration and regret naturally fall out of the framework. In addition, this game links evaluation of forecasts to randomness of outcomes. Random outcomes with respect to forecasts are equivalent to good forecasts with respect to outcomes. We call those dual aspects, calibration and regret, predictiveness and randomness, the four facets of forecast felicity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Convergence of AdaGrad with Relaxed Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the convergence of AdaGrad with momentum (covering AdaGrad as a special case) on non-convex smooth optimization problems. We consider a general noise model where the noise magnitude is controlled by the function value gap together with the gradient magnitude. This model encompasses a broad range of noises including bounded noise, sub-Gaussian noise, affine variance noise and the expected smoothness, and it has been shown to be more realistic in many practical applications. Our analysis yields a probabilistic convergence rate which, under the general noise, could reach at (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})). This rate does not rely on prior knowledge of problem-parameters and could accelerate to (\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T)) where (T) denotes the total number iterations, when the noise parameters related to the function value gap and noise level are sufficiently small. The convergence rate thus matches the lower rate for stochastic first-order methods over non-convex smooth landscape up to logarithm terms [Arjevani et al., 2023]. We further derive a convergence bound for AdaGrad with mometum, considering the generalized smoothness where the local smoothness is controlled by a first-order function of the gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Concentration of a sparse Bayesian model with Horseshoe prior in estimating high-dimensional precision matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision matrices are crucial in many fields such as social networks, neuroscience, and economics, representing the edge structure of Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), where a zero in an off-diagonal position of the precision matrix indicates conditional independence between nodes. In high-dimensional settings where the dimension of the precision matrix \( p \) exceeds the sample size \( n \) and the matrix is sparse, methods like graphical Lasso, graphical SCAD, and CLIME are popular for estimating GGMs. While frequentist methods are well-studied, Bayesian approaches for (unstructured) sparse precision matrices are less explored. The graphical horseshoe estimate by \cite{li2019graphical}, applying the global-local horseshoe prior, shows superior empirical performance, but theoretical work for sparse precision matrix estimations using shrinkage priors is limited. This paper addresses these gaps by providing concentration results for the tempered posterior with the fully specified horseshoe prior in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, we also provide novel theoretical results for model misspecification, offering a general oracle inequality for the posterior. A concise set of simulations is performed to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Multivariate Extremes via a Geometric Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of geometric extremes, where extremal dependence properties are inferred from the deterministic limiting shapes of scaled sample clouds, provides an exciting approach to modelling the extremes of multivariate data. These shapes, termed limit sets, link together several popular extremal dependence modelling frameworks. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool, current inference techniques are limited to a low dimensional setting (d &lt; 5), and generally require rigid modelling assumptions. In this work, we propose a range of novel theoretical results to aid with the implementation of the geometric extremes framework and introduce the first approach to modelling limit sets using deep learning. By leveraging neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependencies between meteorological and oceanographic variables in the North Sea off the coast of the UK.</description>

      <title>MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</description>

      <title>NGD converges to less degenerate solutions than SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of free parameters, or dimension, of a model is a straightforward way to measure its complexity: a model with more parameters can encode more information. However, this is not an accurate measure of complexity: models capable of memorizing their training data often generalize well despite their high dimension. Effective dimension aims to more directly capture the complexity of a model by counting only the number of parameters required to represent the functionality of the model. Singular learning theory (SLT) proposes the learning coefficient $ \lambda $ as a more accurate measure of effective dimension. By describing the rate of increase of the volume of the region of parameter space around a local minimum with respect to loss, $ \lambda $ incorporates information from higher-order terms. We compare $ \lambda $ of models trained using natural gradient descent (NGD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and find that those trained with NGD consistently have a higher effective dimension for both of our methods: the Hessian trace $ \text{Tr}(\mathbf{H}) $, and the estimate of the local learning coefficient (LLC) $ \hat{\lambda}(w^*) $.</description>
