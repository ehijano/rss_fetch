      <title>Reinforcement learning framework for the mechanical design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.</description>

      <title>Implicit Sub-stepping Scheme for Critical State Soil Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stress integration of critical soil model is usually based on implicit Euler algorithm, where the stress predictor is corrected by employing a return mapping algorithm. In the case of large load step, the solution of local nonlinear system to compute the plastic multiplier may not be attained. To overcome this problem, a sub-stepping scheme shall be used to improve the convergence of the local nonlin- ear system solution strategy. Nevertheless, the complexity of the tangent operator of the sub-stepping scheme is high. This complicates the use of Newton-Raphson algorithm to obtain global quadratic convergence. In this paper, a formulation for consistent tangent operator is developed for implicit sub-stepping integration for the modified Cam-Clay model and unified Clay and Sand model. This formulation is highly efficient and can be used with problem involving large load step, such as tun- nel simulation.</description>

      <title>Optical to infrared mapping of vapor-to-liquid phase change dynamics using generative machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared thermography is a powerful tool for studying liquid-to-vapor phase change processes. However, its application has been limited in the study of vapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid dynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental difficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to studying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise condensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic two-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and departure, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and nanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature measurements with both spatial (12 $\mu$m) and temporal (5 ms) precision, leading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using conventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to droplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local condensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local thermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map visual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical parameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional parameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local temperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by developing a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local thermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided and fabrication-aware inverse design of photonic devices using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing free-form photonic devices is fundamentally challenging due to the vast number of possible geometries and the complex requirements of fabrication constraints. Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.</description>

      <title>Lattice Dynamics of Energy Materials Investigated by Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, I discuss several basic science studies in the field of energy materials using neutron scattering as a probe for the lattice dynamics. To enable understanding of neutron scattering spectra, I also use computational and theoretical methods. These methods and neutron scattering in general are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic quantum mechanics as well as with solid state physics topics including the band theory of electrons, harmonic lattice dynamics, and molecular dynamics. For the unfamiliar reader, the details of electronic structure theory and lattice dynamics that are needed to understand the methods in Chapter 2 are provided in Chapters 3 and 4. In the remaining chapters, these methods are applied to the study of several energy materials: cuprate La2CuO4,(hybrid) solar perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, and thermoelectric clathrate Ba8Ga16Ge30.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Metasurfaces for Wavefront Restoration in Under-Display Camera Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under-display camera (UDC) systems enable full-screen displays in smartphones by embedding the camera beneath the display panel, eliminating the need for notches or punch holes. However, the periodic pixel structures of display panels introduce significant optical diffraction effects, leading to imaging artifacts and degraded visual quality. Conventional approaches to mitigate these distortions, such as deep learning-based image reconstruction, are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications in consumer electronics. This work introduces an inverse-designed metasurface for wavefront restoration, addressing diffraction-induced distortions without relying on external software processing. The proposed metasurface effectively suppresses higher-order diffraction modes caused by the metallic pixel structures, restores the optical wavefront, and enhances imaging quality across multiple wavelengths. By eliminating the need for software-based post-processing, our approach establishes a scalable, real-time optical solution for diffraction management in UDC systems. This advancement paves the way to achieve software-free real-time image restoration frameworks for many industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent GW via conservation of spectral moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on a recently introduced alternate framework for $GW$ simulation of charged excitations [Scott et. al., J. Chem. Phys., 158, 124102 (2023)], based around the conservation of directly computed spectral moments of the GW self-energy. Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases. Finally, we consider the Chlorophyll A molecule, finding agreement with experiment within the experimental uncertainty, and a description of the full-frequency spectrum of charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the problem to finding a substitution for the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated in a parameter-free way.</description>

      <title>Matsubara-Frequency-Resolved Spin Exchange-Correlation Kernel for the Three-Dimensional Uniform Electron Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate and Extremely High Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+ and 6- - 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential Learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm which learns with focusing the input parameter with the highest variance and can extract the most significant input parameter to the outputs, based on a computed value of "potentiality". It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the OMNI solar wind database, corresponding from solar cycle 23 to beginning of cycle 25, were used as the PL input parameters. PL selected the solar wind velocity as the most significant solar wind parameter for the moderate and extremely high Kp levels. The value of potentiality of solar wind density was, however, could not ignore an impact on geomagnetic activity. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as the PL input data under all Kp levels. At higher than the moderate Kp level, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind velocity, if the plasma density is large, suggesting that not only solar wind velocity but also density might significantly contribute to geomagnetic activity. These PL and statistical investigations show that the solar wind density begins to regulate Kp higher than moderate geomagnetic activity level under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centres of mass. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this is computationally expensive and complex. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>
