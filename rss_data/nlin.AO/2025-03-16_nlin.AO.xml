      <title>Master Stability Functions in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is an emergent and fundamental phenomenon in nature and engineered systems. Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Untapped Potential in Self-Optimization of Hopfield Networks: The Creativity of Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network, leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, it has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency, which renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on creativity studies, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we show that learning is needed to find creative outcomes above chance probability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modifying the learning parameters in the SO model gives rise to four different regimes that can account for both creative products and inconclusive outcomes, thus providing a framework for studying and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>
