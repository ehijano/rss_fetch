      <title>The Power in Communication: Power Regularization of Communication for Autonomy in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication plays a vital role for coordination in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. However, misaligned agents can exploit other agents' trust and delegated power to the communication medium. In this paper, we propose power regularization as a method to limit the adverse effects of communication by misaligned agents, specifically communication which impairs the performance of cooperative agents. Power is a measure of the influence one agent's actions have over another agent's policy. By introducing power regularization, we aim to allow designers to control or reduce agents' dependency on communication when appropriate, and make them more resilient to performance deterioration due to misuses of communication. We investigate several environments in which power regularization can be a valuable capability for learning different policies that reduce the effect of power dynamics between agents during communication.</description>

      <title>Attention-Driven Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Enhancing Decisions with Expertise-Informed Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach to enhancing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) through the integration of domain knowledge and attention-based policy mechanisms. Our methodology focuses on the incorporation of domain-specific expertise into the learning process, which simplifies the development of collaborative behaviors. This approach aims to reduce the complexity and learning overhead typically associated with MARL by enabling agents to concentrate on essential aspects of complex tasks, thus optimizing the learning curve. The utilization of attention mechanisms plays a key role in our model. It allows for the effective processing of dynamic context data and nuanced agent interactions, leading to more refined decision-making. Applied in standard MARL scenarios, such as the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL) Pursuit and Multi-Particle Environments (MPE) Simple Spread, our method has been shown to improve both learning efficiency and the effectiveness of collaborative behaviors. The results indicate that our attention-based approach can be a viable approach for improving the efficiency of MARL training process, integrating domain-specific knowledge at the action level.</description>

      <title>NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-Based Algorithm-Level Privacy Preservation for Push-Sum Average Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average consensus is essential for multi-agent systems to achieve specific functions and is widely used in network control, information fusion, etc. In conventional average consensus algorithms, all agents reach an agreement by individual calculations and sharing information with their respective neighbors. Nevertheless, the information interactions that occur in the communication network may make sensitive information be revealed. In this paper, we develop a new privacy-preserving average consensus method for unbalanced digraphs. Specifically, we ensure privacy preservation by carefully embedding randomness in mixing weights to confuse communications and introducing an extra auxiliary parameter to mask the state-updated rule in the initial several iterations. In parallel, we exploit the intrinsic robustness of consensus dynamics to guarantee that the average consensus is precisely achieved. Theoretical results demonstrate that the designed algorithms can converge linearly to the exact average consensus value and can guarantee privacy preservation of agents against both honest-but-curious and eavesdropping attacks. The designed algorithms are fundamentally different compared to differential privacy based algorithms that enable privacy preservation via sacrificing consensus performance. Finally, numerical experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Leadership Inference for Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively predicting intent and behavior requires inferring leadership in multi-agent interactions. Dynamic games provide an expressive theoretical framework for modeling these interactions. Employing this framework, we propose a novel method to infer the leader in a two-agent game by observing the agents' behavior in complex, long-horizon interactions. We make two contributions. First, we introduce an iterative algorithm that solves dynamic two-agent Stackelberg games with nonlinear dynamics and nonquadratic costs, and demonstrate that it consistently converges. Second, we propose the Stackelberg Leadership Filter (SLF), an online method for identifying the leading agent in interactive scenarios based on observations of the game interactions. We validate the leadership filter's efficacy on simulated driving scenarios to demonstrate that the SLF can draw conclusions about leadership that match right-of-way expectations.</description>

      <title>EnergAIze: Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Vehicle to Grid Energy Management</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the increasing roles of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). While indicating a new era of sustainable energy, these also introduce complex challenges, including the need to balance supply and demand and smooth peak consumptions amidst rising EV adoption rates. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions such as Demand Response (DR), energy flexibility management, Renewable Energy Communities (RECs), and more specifically for EVs, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). However, existing V2G approaches often fall short in real-world adaptability, global REC optimization with other flexible assets, scalability, and user engagement. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces EnergAIze, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) energy management framework, leveraging the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. EnergAIze enables user-centric and multi-objective energy management by allowing each prosumer to select from a range of personal management objectives, thus encouraging engagement. Additionally, it architects' data protection and ownership through decentralized computing, where each prosumer can situate an energy management optimization node directly at their own dwelling. The local node not only manages local energy assets but also fosters REC wide optimization. The efficacy of EnergAIze was evaluated through case studies employing the CityLearn simulation framework. These simulations were instrumental in demonstrating EnergAIze's adeptness at implementing V2G technology within a REC and other energy assets. The results show reduction in peak loads, ramping, carbon emissions, and electricity costs at the REC level while optimizing for individual prosumers objectives.</description>

      <title>Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</description>
