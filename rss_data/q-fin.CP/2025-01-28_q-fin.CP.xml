      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>In-Context Operator Learning for Linear Propagator Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator learning in the context of linear propagator models for optimal order execution problems with transient price impact \`a la Bouchaud et al. (2004) and Gatheral (2010). Transient price impact persists and decays over time according to some propagator kernel. Specifically, we propose to use In-Context Operator Networks (ICON), a novel transformer-based neural network architecture introduced by Yang et al. (2023), which facilitates data-driven learning of operators by merging offline pre-training with an online few-shot prompting inference. First, we train ICON to learn the operator from various propagator models that maps the trading rate to the induced transient price impact. The inference step is then based on in-context prediction, where ICON is presented only with a few examples. We illustrate that ICON is capable of accurately inferring the underlying price impact model from the data prompts, even with propagator kernels not seen in the training data. In a second step, we employ the pre-trained ICON model provided with context as a surrogate operator in solving an optimal order execution problem via a neural network control policy, and demonstrate that the exact optimal execution strategies from Abi Jaber and Neuman (2022) for the models generating the context are correctly retrieved. Our introduced methodology is very general, offering a new approach to solving optimal stochastic control problems with unknown state dynamics, inferred data-efficiently from a limited number of examples by leveraging the few-shot and transfer learning capabilities of transformer networks.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo simulation for VIX options in the rough Bergomi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the pricing of VIX options in the rough Bergomi model. In this setting, the VIX random variable is defined by the one-dimensional integral of the exponential of a Gaussian process with correlated increments, hence approximate samples of the VIX can be constructed via discretization of the integral and simulation of a correlated Gaussian vector. A Monte-Carlo estimator of VIX options based on a rectangle discretization scheme and exact Gaussian sampling via the Cholesky method has a computational complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ when the mean-squared error is set to $\varepsilon^2$. We demonstrate that this cost can be reduced to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \log^2(\varepsilon))$ combining the scheme above with the multilevel method, and further reduced to the asymptotically optimal cost $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ when using a trapezoidal discretization. We provide numerical experiments highlighting the efficiency of the multilevel approach in the pricing of VIX options in such a rough forward variance setting.</description>
