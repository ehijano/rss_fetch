      <title>Higher-Order Spectra and their Unbiased Estimation in the GPU-accelerated SignalSnap Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of time-dependent data poses a fundamental challenge in many fields of science and engineering. While concepts for higher-order spectral analysis like Brillinger's polyspectra for stationary processes have long been introduced, their applications have been limited probably due to high computational cost and complexity of implementation. Here we discuss the theoretical background of estimating polyspectra with our open-source GPU-accelerated SignaSnap library and highlight its advantages over previous implementations: (i) The calculation of spectra is unprecedentedly based on unbiased and consistent estimators that suppress the appearance of false structures in fourth-order spectra. (ii) SignalSnap implements cross-correlation spectra for up to four channels. (iii) The spectral estimates of SignalSnap have a clear relation to Brillinger's definition of ideal spectra of continuous stochastic processes in terms of amplitude and spectral resolution. (iv) SignalSnap estimates the variance of each spectral value. We show how polyspectra reveal, e.g., the correlations between different channels or the breaking of time-inversion symmetry and discuss how quasi-polyspectra uncover the non-stationarity of signals.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional representation of brain networks for seizure risk forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <title>Family-Vicsek universality of the binary intrinsic dimension of nonequilibrium data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium. Yet, its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanical Analysis of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze Gaussian processes using statistical mechanics. Although the input is originally multidimensional, we simplify our model by considering the input as one-dimensional for statistical mechanical analysis. Furthermore, we employ periodic boundary conditions as an additional modeling approach. By using periodic boundary conditions, we can diagonalize the covariance matrix. The diagonalized covariance matrix is then applied to Gaussian processes. This allows for a statistical mechanical analysis of Gaussian processes using the derived diagonalized matrix. We indicate that the analytical solutions obtained in this method closely match the results from simulations.</description>

      <title>Substantial precision enhancements via adaptive symmetry-informed Bayesian metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements are essential for addressing major challenges, ranging from gravitational wave detection to healthcare diagnostics. While quantum sensing experiments are constantly improving to deliver greater precision, the in-depth optimisation of measurement procedures beyond phase estimation has been overlooked. Here we present a systematic strategy for parameter estimation that can be applied across a wide range of experimental platforms operating in the low data limit. Its strength is the inclusion of experimental control parameters, which allows optimisation within a Bayesian procedure and adaptive repetition. We provide general expressions for the optimal estimator and error for any parameter amenable to symmetry-informed strategies. We demonstrate the power of this strategy by applying it to atom number estimation in a quantum technology experiment. Our protocol results in a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the atom number estimate compared to a standard, unoptimized protocol. Equivalently, it achieves the target precision with a third of the data points previously required. The enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection achieved with this Bayesian optimised strategy will be essential for applications in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>
