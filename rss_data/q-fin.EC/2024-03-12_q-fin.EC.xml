      <title>Investigating Changes of Water Quality in Reservoirs based on Flood and Inflow Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water temperature and dissolved oxygen are essential indicators of water quality and ecosystem sustainability. Lately, heavy rainfalls are happening frequently and forcefully affecting the thermal structure and mixing layers in depth by sharply increasing the volume of inflow entitled flash flood. It can occur by sudden intense precipitation and develop within minutes or hours. Because of heavy debris load and speedy water, this phenomenon has remarkable effects on water quality. A higher flow during floods may worsens water quality at lakes and reservoirs that are thermally stratified (with separate density layers) and decrease dissolved oxygen content. However, it is unclear how well these parameters represent the response of lakes to changes in volume discharge. To address this question, researchers simulate the thermal structure in two stratified reservoirs, considering the Rajae reservoir as a representative reservoir in the north of Iran and Minab reservoir in the south. In this study, the model realistically represented variations of dissolved oxygen and temperature of dams Lake response to flash floods. The model performance was evaluated using observed data from stations on the dams lake. In this case, the inflow charge considered in a 10-day flash flood from April 6th to April 16th during the yearly normal flow. The complete mixture in a part of the thermal structure has been proved in Rajaee reservoir. The nonpermanent impact of the massive inflow of storm runoff caused an increase in oxygen-consuming, leading to a severe decrease in dissolved oxygen on epilimnion and metalimnion. The situation in Minab reservoir was relatively different from Rajae reservoir. The inflow changes not only cause mixture but also help expanding stratification.</description>

      <title>The impact of social status on the formation of collaborative ties and effort provision: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether competition for social status induces higher effort provision and efficiency when individuals collaborate with their network neighbors. We consider a laboratory experiment in which individuals choose a costly collaborative effort and their network neighbors. They benefit from their neighbors' effort and effort choices of direct neighbors are strategic complements. We introduce two types of social status in a 2x2 factorial design: 1) individuals receive monetary benefits for incoming links representing popularity; 2) they receive feedback on their relative payoff ranking within the group. We find that link benefits induce higher effort provision and strengthen the collaborative ties relative to the Baseline treatment without social status. In contrast, the ranking information induces lower effort as individuals start competing for higher ranking. Overall, we find that social status has no significant impact on the number of links in the network and the efficiency of collaboration in the group.</description>

      <title>Network formation and efficiency in linear-quadratic games: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study effort provision and network formation in the linear-quadratic game characterized by positive externality and complementarity of effort choices among network neighbors. We compare experimental outcomes to the equilibrium and efficient allocations and study the impact of group size and linking costs. We find that individuals overprovide effort relative to the equilibrium level on the network they form. However, their payoffs are lower than the equilibrium payoffs because they create fewer links than it is optimal which limits the beneficial spillovers of effort provision. Reducing the linking costs does not significantly increase the connectedness of the network and the welfare loss is higher in larger groups. Individuals connect to the highest effort providers in the group and ignore links to relative low effort providers, even if those links would be beneficial to form. This effect explains the lack of links in the network.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion and Price Discrimination: The Over-Usage of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As firms' pricing strategies increasingly rely on algorithms, two concerns have received much attention: algorithmic tacit collusion and price discrimination. This paper investigates the interaction between these two issues through simulations. In each period, a new buyer arrives with independently and identically distributed willingness to pay (WTP), and each firm, observing private signals about WTP, adopts Q-learning algorithms to set prices. We document two novel mechanisms that lead to collusive outcomes. Under asymmetric information, the algorithm with information advantage adopts a Bait-and-Restrained-Exploit strategy, surrendering profits on some signals by setting higher prices, while exploiting limited profits on the remaining signals by setting much lower prices. Under a symmetric information structure, competition on some signals facilitates convergence to supra-competitive prices on the remaining signals. Algorithms tend to collude more on signals with higher expected WTP. Both uncertainty and the lack of correlated signals exacerbate the degree of collusion, thereby reducing both consumer surplus and social welfare. A key implication is that the over-usage of data, both payoff-relevant and non-relevant, by AIs in competitive contexts will reduce the degree of collusion and consequently lead to a decline in industry profits.</description>

      <title>A New Testing Method for Justification Bias Using High-Frequency Data of Health and Employment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Justification bias, wherein retirees may report poorer health to rationalize their retirement, poses a major concern to the widely-used measure of self-assessed health in retirement studies. This paper introduces a novel method for testing the presence of this bias in the spirit of regression discontinuity. The underlying idea is that any sudden shift in self-assessed health immediately following retirement is more likely attributable to the bias. Our strategy is facilitated by a unique high-frequency data that offers monthly, in contrast to the typical biennial, information on employment, self-assessed health, and objective health conditions. Across a wider post-retirement time frame, we observe a decline in self-assessed health, potentially stemming from both justification bias and changes in actual health. However, this adverse effect diminishes with shorter intervals, indicating no evidence of such bias. Our method also validates a widely-used indirect testing approach.</description>

      <title>Generative Probabilistic Forecasting with Applications in Market Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative probabilistic forecasting approach derived from the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series. Under the paradigm of generative artificial intelligence, the proposed forecasting architecture includes an autoencoder that transforms nonparametric multivariate random processes into canonical innovation sequences, from which future time series samples are generated according to their probability distributions conditioned on past samples. A novel deep-learning algorithm is proposed that constrains the latent process to be an independent and identically distributed sequence with matching autoencoder input-output conditional probability distributions. Asymptotic optimality and structural convergence properties of the proposed generative forecasting approach are established. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for merchant storage participants, {(ii) interregional price spread forecasting for interchange markets,} and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate superior performance against leading traditional and machine learning-based forecasting techniques under both probabilistic and point forecast metrics.</description>

      <title>Economic complexity and the sustainability transition: A review of data, methods, and literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic Complexity (EC) methods have gained increasing popularity across fields and disciplines. In particular, the EC toolbox has proved particularly promising in the study of complex and interrelated phenomena, such as the transition towards a greener economy. Using the EC approach, scholars have been investigating the relationship between EC and sustainability, proposing to identify the distinguishing characteristics of green products and to assess the readiness of productive and technological structures for the sustainability transition. This article proposes to review and summarize the data, methods, and empirical literature that are relevant to the study of the sustainability transition from an EC perspective. We review three distinct but connected blocks of literature on EC and environmental sustainability. First, we survey the evidence linking measures of EC to indicators related to environmental sustainability. Second, we review articles that strive to assess the green competitiveness of productive systems. Third, we examine evidence on green technological development and its connection to non-green knowledge bases. Finally, we summarize the findings for each block and identify avenues for further research in this recent and growing body of empirical literature.</description>
