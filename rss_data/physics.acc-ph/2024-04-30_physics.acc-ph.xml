      <title>Elevating electron energy gain and betatron X-ray emission in proton-driven wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long proton beams present at CERN have the potential to evolve into a train of microbunches through the self-modulation instability process. The resonant wakefield generated by a periodic train of proton microbunches can establish a high acceleration field within the plasma, facilitating electron acceleration. This paper investigates the impact of plasma density on resonant wakefield excitation, thus influencing acceleration of a witness electron bunch and its corresponding betatron radiation within the wakefield. Various scenarios involving different plasma densities are explored through particle-in-cell simulations. The peak wakefield in each scenario is calculated by considering a long pre-modulated proton driver with a fixed peak current. Subsequently, the study delves into the witness beam acceleration in the wakefield and its radiation emission. Elevated plasma density increases both the number of microbunches and the accelerating gradient of each microbunch, consequently resulting in heightened resonant wakefield. Nevertheless, the scaling is disrupted by the saturation of the resonant wakefield due to the nonlinearities. The simulation results reveal that at high plasma densities an intense and broadband radiation spectrum extending into the domain of the hard X-rays and gamma rays is generated. Furthermore, in such instances, the energy gain of the witness beam is significantly enhanced. The impact of wakefield on the witness energy gain and the corresponding radiation spectrum is clearly evident at extremely elevated densities.</description>

      <title>Correlations between X-rays, Visible Light and Drive-Beam Energy Loss Observed in Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiments at FACET-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study documents several correlations observed during the first run of the plasma wakefield acceleration experiment E300 conducted at FACET-II, using a single drive electron bunch. The established correlations include those between the measured maximum energy loss of the drive electron beam and the integrated betatron x-ray signal, the calculated total beam energy deposited in the plasma and the integrated x-ray signal, among three visible light emission measuring cameras, and between the visible plasma light and x-ray signal. The integrated x-ray signal correlates almost linearly with both the maximum energy loss of the drive beam and the energy deposited into the plasma, demonstrating its usability as a measure of energy transfer from the drive beam to the plasma. Visible plasma light is found to be a useful indicator of the presence of wake at three locations that overall are two meters apart. Despite the complex dynamics and vastly different timescales, the x-ray radiation from the drive bunch and visible light emission from the plasma may prove to be effective non-invasive diagnostics for monitoring the energy transfer from the beam to the plasma in future high-repetition-rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluid Closures and Pressure Anisotropies in Numerical Simulations of Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>

      <title>Printed Circuit Board Based Rotating Coils for Measuring Sextupole Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for the inductive pick-up windings of rotating coil probes has made the construction of these precision magnetic measurement devices much more accessible. This paper discusses the design details for PCBs which on each layer of the board provide for simultaneous analog bucking (suppression) of dipole, quadrupole, and sextupole field components so as to more accurately measure the higher order harmonic fields in sextupole magnets. Techniques to generate designs are discussed, as well as trade-offs to optimize sensitivity. Examples of recent sextupole PCBs and their performance are given.</description>
