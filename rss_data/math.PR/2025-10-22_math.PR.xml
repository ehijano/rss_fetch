      <title>On the Kolmogorov Distance of Max-Stable Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we derive explicit bounds on the Kolmogorov distance for multivariate max-stable distributions with Fr\'echet margins. We formulate those bounds in terms of (i) Wasserstein distances between de Haan representers, (ii) total variation distances between spectral/angular measures - removing the dimension factor from earlier results in the canonical sphere case - and (iii) discrepancies of the Psi-functions in the inf-argmax decomposition. Extensions to different margins and Archimax/clustered Archimax copulas are further discussed. Examples include logistic, comonotonic, independent and Brown-Resnick models.</description>

      <title>Law equivalence for Ornstein--Uhlenbeck dynamics driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stochastic partial differential equations driven by L\'evy noise, understanding when changes in the drift operator preserve the law of the solution is fundamental to filtering, control, and simulation. We extend law-equivalence results for Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) processes from bounded drift operators to generators of $C_0$-semigroups (indeed analytic semigroups) on a separable Hilbert space. Our analysis separates the problem into two channels: a Gaussian component governed by a Hilbert--Schmidt perturbation condition, and a jump-drift component requiring a directional Cameron--Martin hypothesis. We establish that when the Gaussian noise is non-degenerate, these conditions characterise absolute continuity and equivalence of path laws on the Skorohod space. For purely jump noise, we prove a rigidity phenomenon: absolute continuity forces the processes to coincide. Specialising to sectorial elliptic generators with compound Poisson jumps, we provide explicit, verifiable conditions in terms of resolvent estimates and exponential moments. We also construct explicit counterexamples showing that the Cameron--Martin condition can fail, sometimes asymmetrically, yielding only one-sided absolute continuity.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Fields on a hypercube from Long Range Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Gaussian Free Fields denoted by $(g_x)_{x \in {\cal V}_N}$, where $ {\cal V}_N = \{0,1\}^N$ and $N\in \mathbb{Z}_+$. These fields are related to a general class of $N$-dimensional random walks on the hypercube, which are killed at a certain rate. The covariance structure of the Gaussian free field is determined by the Green function of these random walks. There exists a coupling such that the Gaussian free fields ${\cal G}_N := \big (g_{x}\big )_{x \in {\cal V}_N}$ form a Markov chain where $N$ is time.
  If the $N$ entries of the random walk are exchangeable, then the random variables in the Gaussian field can be coupled with spin glass models. A natural choice is to take the increments of the random walk to be from a de Finetti sequence with elements $\{0,1\}$. The random walk is then well defined on ${\cal V}_\infty$. The Green function and a strong representation for $(g_x)$ are characterized by a point process which involves the de Finetti measure of the increments of the random walk. A limit theorem as $N\to \infty$ is found for level set sums of the Gaussian free field.
  In the limit Gaussian process the covariance function is a mixture of a bivariate normal density, with the correlation mixed by a distribution on $[-1,1]$. We also study a complex Gaussian field which is the transform of the Gaussian process limit.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniform random measures, transport and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey explores the foundational theory and recent developments in the study of hyperuniformity. We present a comprehensive mathematical framework in the context of weakly stationary random measures, emphasizing spectral characterizations and second order asymptotics. Classical examples - including determinantal point processes, Gibbs measures, and zero sets of Gaussian analytic functions - are presented in depth to illustrate core principles. We also highlight recent progress connecting hyperuniformity with optimal transport and rigidity phenomena, pointing to emerging directions in the field.</description>

      <title>A restless time-fractional multiclass queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single-server priority queue with a finite number of classes, in which the arrivals follow a fractional Poisson process of index $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and the service completions are triggered by an independent fractional Poisson process of index $\beta \in (0,1]$. Each of the customers arriving is assigned at random to one of the priority classes. This assignment is independent of the rest of the system and follows a fixed probability distribution.
  Using a time-change representation of a fractional Poisson process, we first give a multinomial thinning decomposition: the total number of arrivals in each class are independent standard Poisson processes of appropriate intensities, time-changed by a common independent random clock that is the inverse of an $\alpha$-stable subordinator. This yields a process-level law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for the process of arrivals.
  For the queueing system itself, we identify process-level scaling limits for the cumulative and individual queue lengths of the classes. We also prove that the queue gets empty infinitely often when $\alpha \le \beta$, which does include the critical case $\alpha = \beta$. A final example shows how the model can be extended to a continuum of classes.</description>

      <title>On the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Girko matrices have independent and identically distributed entries of mean zero and unit variance. In this note, we consider the random matrix model formed by the ratio of two independent Girko matrices, its entries are dependent and heavy-tailed. Our main message is that divided by the square root of the dimension, the spectral radius of the ratio converges in distribution, when the dimension tends to infinity, to a universal heavy-tailed distribution. We provide a mathematical proof of this high-dimensional phenomenon, under a fourth moment matching with a Gaussian case known as the complex Ginibre ensemble. In this Gaussian case, the model is known as the spherical ensemble, and its spectrum is a determinantal planar Coulomb gas. Its image by the inverse stereographic projection is a rotationally invariant gas on the two-sphere. A crucial observation is the invariance in law of the model under inversion, related to its spherical symmetry, and that makes, in a sense, edge and bulk equivalent. Our approach involves Girko Hermitization, local law estimates for Wigner matrices, lower bound estimates on the smallest singular value, and convergence of kernels of determinantal point processes. The universality of the high-dimensional fluctuation of the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices turns out to be remarkably more accessible mathematically than for a single Girko matrix!</description>

      <title>Ranges of Extremal Processes and Heavy-Tailed Random Walks in Spaces of Growing Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider extremal processes and random walks generated by heavy-tailed random vectors. We assume that these vectors take values in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and establish limit theorems for their paths in the triangular array setting when both the number of steps $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow to infinity. For this, the paths are interpreted as finite metric spaces with the $\ell_p$ metric for $p\in[1,\infty]$ and the convergence is understood as convergence in distribution on the family of metric spaces equipped with the Gromov--Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Ising model on the complete graph, also known as the Curie-Weiss model, and establish the limit profile of the Glauber dynamics in the high-temperature regime. Our strategy is a two-dimensional analog of the method developed by Olesker-Taylor and Schmid for the Bernoulli-Laplace urn: The two-coordinate chain associated to the model evolves near-deterministically until just before the cutoff window, while afterwards it approximates a two-dimensional diffusion.</description>

      <title>Evolution of recursive trees with limited memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by questions in social networks, distributed computing and probabilistic combinatorics, the last few years have seen increasing interest in network evolution models where new vertices entering the system need to make decisions based on a partial snapshot of the current state of the network. This paper considers a specific variant of the classical random recursive tree dynamics, where a vertex at time $n+1$ has information only on those vertices that have arrived in the interval $[j(n), n]$ for a sequence $j(n) \uparrow \infty$, and connects to vertices uniformly at random amongst this set. We consider two different regimes on the density information, termed macroscopic and mesoscopic regimes, which respectively correspond to $j(n)=\theta n$ for some $\theta \in (0,1)$, and $j(n)=n-n^{\beta}$ for some $\beta \in (0,1)$. Our main interest is in studying asymptotics of various local and global functionals of the network. We show that in the macroscopic regime, the local limit is expressed in terms of an associated continuous time branching process that depends on the parameter $\theta$, while it is a $\mathrm{Poisson}(1)$-branching process in the mesoscopic regime for any $\beta \in (0,1)$. Furthermore, the height of the macroscopic tree is logarithmic, which we prove exploiting a connection with scaled-attachment random recursive trees (SARRTs) as studied by Devroye, Fawzi and Fraiman (RSA 2011), while it is polynomial in the mesoscopic regime; our argument in this latter case relies on a differential equation approach to track the ancestor indices of late-coming vertices, together with a multiscale analysis. Further, we develop an exploration algorithm to simultaneously reveal the ancestral path of youngest vertices. Using this algorithm, we show that in the mesoscopic regime, the global structure experiences a phase transition at $\beta=1/2$.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the first-passage properties of a jump process with constant drift where jump amplitudes and inter-arrival times follow arbitrary light-tailed distributions with smooth densities. Using a mapping to an effective discrete-time random walk, we identify three regimes determined by the drift strength: survival (weak drift), absorption (strong drift), and critical. We derive explicit expressions for exponential decay rates in the survival and absorption regimes, and characterize algebraic decay at the critical point. We also obtain asymptotic behavior of the mean first-passage time, number of jumps, and their variances for processes starting either close to the origin or far from it.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Euler-type Scheme for L\'evy-driven SDEs with Superlinear and Time-Irregular Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a randomized tamed Euler scheme tailored for L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with superlinear random coefficients and Carath\'eodory-type drift. Under assumptions that allow for time-irregular drifts while ensuring appropriate time-regularity of the diffusion and jump coefficients, the proposed scheme is shown to achieve the optimal strong $\mathcal{L}^2$-convergence rate, arbitrarily close to $0.5$.
  A crucial component of our methodology is the incorporation of drift randomization, which overcomes challenges due to low time-regularity, along with a taming technique to handle the superlinear state dependence.
  Our analysis moreover covers settings where the coefficients are random, providing for instance strong convergence of randomized tamed Euler schemes for L\'evy-driven stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with Markovian switching. To our knowledge, this is the first {work} that addresses the case of superlinear coefficients in the numerical analysis of Carath\'eodory-type SDEs and even for ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note studies the asymptotic behavior of a generating function associated with the decimal expansion of \(2^n\). Our aims are twofold: (i) to present a problem on the best possible upper bound for this behavior, and (ii) to introduce a matrix representation that is useful for its analysis. The representation corresponds to a finite-state transfer operator; analytic and dynamical aspects are not pursued here.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility and Galois groups of random reciprocal polynomials of large degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A = a_0T^m + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} a_j (T^{m-j}+T^{m+j}) + T^{2m}+1 \in \mathbf{Z}[T]$ be a monic reciprocal polynomial of degree $2m$ sampled randomly by selecting its coefficients $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1}$ independently according to a given probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbf{Z}$. For a wide range of measures $\mu$, we prove that $A$ is irreducible with probability $\ge 1-Cm^{-c}$ for some absolute constants $c,C&gt;0$. In addition, we prove that with the same probability the Galois group of $A$ is either the full hyperoctahedral group $\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m$ or one of two of its index-$2$ subgroups. The main condition that $\mu$ must satisfy is of Fourier-theoretic nature, and holds for example when $\mu$ is the uniform measure on a set of at least $35$ consecutive integers, or on an arbitrary, sufficiently large subset of an interval $[-H,H]$, with $H$ larger than some absolute constant. Our most general result allows for each $a_j$ to be sampled by its own probability measure $\mu_j$.
  Our approach builds on earlier work of Bary-Soroker, Kozma and the second author, who proved for essentially the same $\mu_j$ that the 'standard' monic polynomial $a_0 + \cdots + a_{m-1}T^{m-1} + T^m$ is irreducible and has as Galois group either the symmetric group $\mathcal{S}_m$ or the alternating group $\mathcal{A}_m$ with high probability, conditioning on $a_0 \neq 0$. In our setting of reciprocal polynomials, we can rule out (all subgroups of) the maximal alternating subgroup $(\mathcal{C}_2 \wr \mathcal{S}_m) \cap \mathcal{A}_{2m}$ of the hyperoctahedral group as likely Galois group of $A$ by analyzing its discriminant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Robbins-Monro algorithm is a recursive, simulation-based stochastic procedure to approximate the zeros of a function that can be written as an expectation. It is known that under some technical assumptions, Gaussian limit distributions approximate the stochastic performance of the algorithm. Here, we are interested in strong approximations for Robbins-Monro procedures. The main tool for getting them are local limit theorems, that is, studying the convergence of the density of the algorithm. The analysis relies on a version of parametrix techniques for Markov chains converging to diffusions. The main difficulty that arises here is the fact that the drift is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Equations driven by fast-oscillating functions of an It\^o diffusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study It\^o SDE systems driven by oscillating functions of a single It\^o diffusion process. In the limit when oscillations become fast, we show that the solution process converges in law to the process defined by an SDE system driven by a multivariate Wiener process whose covariance we calculate explicitly. Interestingly, the limiting system of SDEs are most naturally stated using the Stratonovich integral. The problem has been originally motivated by experimental work and special cases of theorems proved here provide a rigorous treatment of equations arising from physics.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

      <title>Transition of $\alpha$-mixing in Random Iterations with Applications in Queuing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05056v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time series models with exogenous regressors are essential in econometrics, queuing theory, and machine learning, though their statistical analysis remains incomplete. Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</description>

      <title>On the geometric Brownian motion with state-dependent variable exponent diffusion term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates. A detailed comparison of the It\^o and Stratonovich interpretations for the proposed model is presented in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>
