      <title>ULV: A robust statistical method for clustered data, with applications to multisubject, single-cell omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and genomic technological advancements have greatly enhanced our understanding of biological processes by allowing us to quantify key biological variables such as gene expression, protein levels, and microbiome compositions. These breakthroughs have enabled us to achieve increasingly higher levels of resolution in our measurements, exemplified by our ability to comprehensively profile biological information at the single-cell level. However, the analysis of such data faces several critical challenges: limited number of individuals, non-normality, potential dropouts, outliers, and repeated measurements from the same individual. In this article, we propose a novel method, which we call U-statistic based latent variable (ULV). Our proposed method takes advantage of the robustness of rank-based statistics and exploits the statistical efficiency of parametric methods for small sample sizes. It is a computationally feasible framework that addresses all the issues mentioned above simultaneously. An additional advantage of ULV is its flexibility in modeling various types of single-cell data, including both RNA and protein abundance. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated in two studies: a single-cell proteomics study of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and a single-cell RNA study of COVID-19 symptoms. In the AML study, ULV successfully identified differentially expressed proteins that would have been missed by the pseudobulk version of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. In the COVID-19 study, ULV identified genes associated with covariates such as age and gender, and genes that would be missed without adjusting for covariates. The differentially expressed genes identified by our method are less biased toward genes with high expression levels. Furthermore, ULV identified additional gene pathways likely contributing to the mechanisms of COVID-19 severity.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of random scan Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference under log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference scheme is a popular algorithm used to compute the mean-field approximation of a probability distribution of interest. We analyze its random scan version, under log-concavity assumptions on the target density. Our approach builds on the recent work of M. Arnese and D. Lacker, \emph{Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport} [arXiv:2404.08792] which studies the deterministic scan version of the algorithm, phrasing it as a block-coordinate descent algorithm in the space of probability distributions endowed with the geometry of optimal transport. We obtain tight rates for the random scan version, which imply that the total number of factor updates required to converge scales linearly with the condition number and the number of blocks of the target distribution. By contrast, available bounds for the deterministic scan case scale quadratically in the same quantities, which is analogue to what happens for optimization of convex functions in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Spline-Based Multi-State Models for Analyzing Disease Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by disease progression-related studies, we propose an estimation method for fitting general non-homogeneous multi-state Markov models. The proposal can handle many types of multi-state processes, with several states and various combinations of observation schemes (e.g., intermittent, exactly observed, censored), and allows for the transition intensities to be flexibly modelled through additive (spline-based) predictors. The algorithm is based on a computationally efficient and stable penalized maximum likelihood estimation approach which exploits the information provided by the analytical Hessian matrix of the model log-likelihood. The proposed modeling framework is employed in case studies that aim at modeling the onset of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and cognitive decline due to aging, where novel patterns are uncovered. To support applicability and reproducibility, all developed tools are implemented in the R package flexmsm.</description>

      <title>Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do we infer a 3D scene from a single image in the presence of corruptions like rain, snow or fog? Straightforward domain randomization relies on knowing the family of corruptions ahead of time. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach-dubbed robust inverse graphics (RIG)-that relies on a strong scene prior and an uninformative uniform corruption prior, making it applicable to a wide range of corruptions. Given a single image, RIG performs posterior inference jointly over the scene and the corruption. We demonstrate this idea by training a neural radiance field (NeRF) scene prior and using a secondary NeRF to represent the corruptions over which we place an uninformative prior. RIG, trained only on clean data, outperforms depth estimators and alternative NeRF approaches that perform point estimation instead of full inference. The results hold for a number of scene prior architectures based on normalizing flows and diffusion models. For the latter, we develop reconstruction-guidance with auxiliary latents (ReGAL)-a diffusion conditioning algorithm that is applicable in the presence of auxiliary latent variables such as the corruption. RIG demonstrates how scene priors can be used beyond generation tasks.</description>
