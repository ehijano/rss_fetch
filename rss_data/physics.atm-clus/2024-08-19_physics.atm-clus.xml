      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multi-electron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, which facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character, such as transition-metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Structure to Property: Chemical Element Embeddings and a Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Prediction of Chemical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of ring Airy vortex beam and ring Pearcey vortex beam in turbulent atmosphere and a comparative analysis of their channel efficiencies and OAM spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere encounters distortions in the wavefront that results in modal scattering. Abruptly autofocussing (AAF) beams with orbital angular momentum have gained significant attention due to their non-diffracting and self-healing nature. These warrants understanding of the behaviour of these beams through turbulent atmosphere absolutely necessary. With this intuition, in the present work we investigate the behaviour of two AAF beams namely ring Airy vortex beam (RAVB) and ring Pearcey vortex beam (RPVB) through the turbulent atmosphere in two cases-multiplexed and non-multiplexed. We propagate multiplexed as well as non-multiplexed RAVB and RPVB in different levels of turbulent atmosphere. In non-multiplexed case, channel efficiency declines for both the beams with increase in modes numbers. In multiplexed case, increasing the gap between the mode sets results in decrease in channel efficiency. We also report that in weak atmospheric turbulence RAVB outperform RPVB in terms of channel efficiency. We use optical transformation sorting (log-polar) method to demultiplex the optical beams at the output. Furthermore, we investigate and compare the OAM spectra of both beams in different levels of atmospheric turbulence and at different propagation distances. The comparison reveals that the spectra of RPVB are more dispersive as compared to that of RAVB.</description>
