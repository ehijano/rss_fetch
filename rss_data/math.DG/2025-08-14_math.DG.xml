      <title>Ricci Solitons on a family of three dimensional Lorentzian Walker manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Ricci soliton is a natural generalization of an Einstein metric. On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M, g), it is defined by : $LX g + \r{ho} = {\lambda} g, where X is a smooth vector field on M , LX denotes the Lie derivative in the direction of X, \r{ho} is the Ricci tensor, and {\lambda} is a real constant. In this paper, we establish the existence of non-trivial Ricci solitons on a family of three-dimensional Lorentzian Walker manifolds.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities for electrostatic systems with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate electrostatic systems with a nonzero cosmological constant on compact manifolds with boundary. We establish new geometric properties for electrostatic manifolds in higher dimensions, extending previous results in the literature. Moreover, we prove sharp boundary estimates and isoperimetric-type inequalities for electrostatic manifolds, as well as volume and boundary inequalities involving the Brown-York and Hawking masses.</description>

      <title>On Multiplicative Weightings for Lie Groupoids and Lie Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough study of the differential geometry of weightings and develop the theory of weightings for vector bundles, Lie groupoids, and Lie algebroids.
  We begin by extending the work of Loizides and Meinrenken on weighted manifolds. We define weighted submanifolds, weighted immersions, and weighted embeddings, and prove normal form theorems for these objects. We also study characterizations of weighted morphisms in terms of their graphs and in terms of weighted paths. We further extend the theory of weighted manifolds by developing a theory of linear weightings for vector bundles.
  Following this, we give three equivalent definitions of a multiplicative weighting for a Lie groupoid: one involving the structure maps for the Lie groupoid, one involving the graph of the groupoid multiplication, and one involving the weighted deformation space. We also include a discussion of weighted VB-groupoids, and prove some basic theorems involving these objects.
  In the last two chapters of this thesis, we study infinitesimally multiplicative weightings for Lie algebroids. We characterize these in terms of linear Poisson structures and homological vector fields. We show that multiplicative weightings differentiate to infinitesimally multiplicative weightings and solve the integration problem for infinitesimally multiplicative weightings along wide Lie subalgebroids. In particular, we classify multiplicative weightings of a Lie groupoid along its units in terms of Lie filtrations of its Lie algebroid. We make progress towards a solution for the general integration problem by giving a condition for when an infinitesimally multiplicative weighting along a general Lie subalgebroid integrates.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Normal Mean Ricci Curvatures: A Bochner--Weitzenboeck Identity for Simple d-Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two pointwise subspace averages of sectional curvature on a d-dimensional plane Pi in T_p M: (i) the intrinsic mean Ricci (the average of sectional curvatures of 2-planes contained in Pi); and (ii) the normal (mixed) mean Ricci (the average of sectional curvatures of 2-planes spanned by one vector in Pi and one in Pi^perp). Using Jacobi-field expansions, these means occur as the r^2/6 coefficients in the intrinsic (d-1)-sphere and normal (n-d-1)-sphere volume elements. A direct consequence is a Bochner--Weitzenboeck identity for simple d-vectors V (built from an orthonormal frame X_1,...,X_d with Pi = span{X_i}): the curvature term equals d(n-d) times the normal mean Ricci of Pi. This yields two immediate applications: (a) a Bochner vanishing criterion for harmonic simple d-vectors under a positive lower bound on the normal mean Ricci; and (b) a Lichnerowicz-type lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian on simple d-eigenfields.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps and framed $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given an element $X$ of the enhanced Teichm\"{u}ller space $\mathcal{T}^\pm(\mathbb{S}, \mathbb{M})$ and a type-preserving framed $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-representation $\hat{\rho} = (\rho,\beta)$, there is a $\rho$-equivariant harmonic map $f:\mathbb{H}^2 \to \mathbb{H}^3$ that is asymptotic to the framing $\beta$. Here, the domain is the universal cover of the punctured Riemann surface obtained from a conformal completion of $X$. Moreover, such a harmonic map is unique if one prescribes, in addition, the principal part of the Hopf differential at each puncture. The proof uses the harmonic map heat flow.</description>

Abstract: We study three-dimensional path geometries with nontrivial torsion of maximal rank. We introduce the notion of constant torsion and show that such path geometries are in one-to-one correspondence with certain cone structures modeled on homogeneous ruled surfaces. We also describe these cone structures in terms of solutions to new integrable systems admitting dispersionless, non-isospectral Lax pairs.</description>

      <title>Kinematical Lie algebras and symplectic symmetric spaces I: Lie algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of kinematical Lie algebra introduced in physics for the classification of the various possible relativity algebras an isotropic spacetime can accommodate.
  We first give an elementary proof of the fact that such a generalized kinematical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ always carries a canonical structure of symplectic involutive Lie algebra (shortly ``siLa''). In other words, if $G$ is a connected Lie group admitting $\mathfrak{g}$ as Lie algebra, there always exists a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$ constituted by the elements of $G$ that are fixed under an involutive automorphism of $G$ and such that the homogenenous space $M=G/H$ is a symplectic symmetric space. In particular, the manifold $M$ canonically carries a $G$-invariant linear torsionfree connection $\nabla$ whose geodesic symmetries centered at all points extend as global $\nabla$-affine transformations of $M$. The manifold $M$ is also canonically equipped with a symplectic structure $\omega$ which is invariant under every geodesic symmetry, implying in particular that it is parallel w.r.t the linear connection: $\nabla\omega=0$.
  In a second part, we give a complete description of the fine structure of our generalized siLa's. Our discussion yields a complete classification of such sila's.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give results on optimal constants of isoperimetric inequalities involving Steklov eigenvalues on surfaces with boundary. We both consider this question on Riemannian surfaces with a same given topology or more specifically belonging to the same conformal class. We provide new examples of topological disks that realize optimal constants. We prove inequalities that relate conformal invariants associated to combinations of Steklov eigenvalues on a compact Riemannian surface with boundary and the ones on the disk. In the appendix, we show rigidity of the first conformal Steklov eigenvalue on annuli and M\"obius bands.</description>

      <title>Atiyah Classes in the Context of Generalized Complex Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy to the classical holomorphic setting, Lang, Jia and Liu introduced the notion of the Atiyah class for a generalized holomorphic vector bundle using three different approaches: leveraging $\rm{\check{C}}$ech cohomology, employing the first jet short exact sequence, and adopting the perspective of Lie algebroid pairs. The purpose of this note is to establish the equivalence among these diverse definitions of the Atiyah class.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structure of Ends of Ricci Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study blow-up sequences of Ricci shrinkers without global curvature assumptions based at points $q$ at which the scalar curvature satisfies a Type I bound, proving that their $\mathbb{F}$-limits split a line. In the four-dimensional case these limits are smooth Ricci shrinkers and the convergence is in the pointed smooth Cheeger-Gromov sense. As a consequence, limits along the integral curve of $\nabla f$ starting at such a point $q$ split a line. This generalises known results about the geometry of ends of Ricci shrinkers that relied on global curvature bounds. To obtain our results, we extend the $\mathbb{F}$-convergence theory from Bamler and Li-Wang.</description>

      <title>Partial Dirac Structures and Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper (PeCa24), the notion of Dirac structure in finite dimension was extended to the convenient setting. In particular, we introduce the notion of \emph{partial Dirac structure on a convenient manifold} and look for which all geometrical results in finite dimension which are still true in this infinite dimensional framework. Note that this context is justified by many mechanical infinite dimensional examples which recover all the classical ones, such as Hilbert, Banach, Fr\'{e}chet context or direct limits of Banach spaces. Another reason is that if we want to extend the variational technics, as in YoMa06II, to the infinite dimensional setting, the category of convenient vector spaces is cartesian closed, which is not the case for the category of locally convex vector spaces and so this variational approach does not work in this last setting. In this second part, first, we look for an adaptation of the results obtained in YoMa06II for a variational approach of constraint Lagrangian on a subbundle of a Banach manifold. Then we study the same type of problem but for constraint Lagrangians on a \textit{singular} distribution. Theses results are finally applied to the characterization of normal geodesics for a conical Finsler metric on a Banach manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the well-established regularity estimates on harmonic maps on surfaces to question their independence with respect to the dimension of the target manifold. We are mainly interested in harmonic maps into target ellipsoids, that we call Laplace harmonic eigenmaps. These maps are related to critical metrics in the context of eigenvalue optimization. The tools that we gather here are useful to handle convergence of almost critical metrics via Palais-Smale sequences of (almost harmonic) eigenmaps. They could also be a preliminary step for a general regularity theory for critical points of infinite combinations of eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Second Variation Formula for Eigenvalue Functionals on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a closed surface as a functional on the space of Riemannian metrics of unit area. N. Nadirashvili has discovered a remarkable connection between critical points of this functional and minimal surfaces in the sphere. It was later extended by A. El Soufi and S. Ilias to cover k-th eigenvalues and critical points in a fixed conformal class, where the latter correspond to harmonic maps to the sphere. These results, however, only contain first order information and cannot be used to determine whether a given critical metric a local maximiser or not. In the present paper we write down the second variation formula for critical metrics and show that the flat metric on the non-rhombic torus can never be a conformal maximiser for the first eigenvalue. Analogous results are proved in the context of the Steklov eigenvalues and flat metrics on a cylinder.</description>

      <title>Product Of Exponentials (POE) Splines on Lie-Groups: Limitations, Extensions, and Application to SO(3) and SE(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for constructing splines and Bezier curves on a Lie group G involve repeated products of exponentials deduced from local geodesics, w.r.t. a Riemannian metric, or rely on general polynomials. Moreover, each of these local curves is supposed to start at the identity of $G$. Both assumptions may not reflect the actual curve to be interpolated. This paper pursues a different approach to construct splines on $G$. Local curves are expressed as solutions of the Poisson equation on G. Therewith, the local interpolations satisfies the boundary conditions while respecting the geometry of $G$. A $k$th-order approximation of the solutions gives rise to a $k$th-order product of exponential (POE) spline. Algorithms for constructing 3rd- and 4th-order splines are derived from closed form expressions for the approximate solutions. Additionally, spline algorithms are introduced that allow prescribing a vector field the curve must follow at the interpolation points. It is shown that the established algorithms, where $k$th-order POE-splines are constructed by concatenating local curves starting at the identity, cannot exactly reconstruct a $k$th-order motion. To tackle this issue, the formulations are extended by allowing for local curves between arbitrary points, rather than curves emanating from the identity. This gives rise to a global $k$th-order spline with arbitrary initial conditions. Several examples are presented, in particular the shape reconstruction of slender rods modeled as geometrically non-linear Cosserat rods.</description>

Abstract: Crochet provides a superior method for the production of two-dimensional surfaces from one-dimensional material. Compared to any of the other known processes to generate constant flat, spherical or hyperbolic shapes, it is the most flexible and precise way to build a dynamical system with very simple local rules and with very high precision of the intrinsic curvature.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for $p$-Hessian equations with general left-hand and right-hand terms on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$. To overcome the constraints of closed manifolds, we advance a new kind of "subsolution", called pseudo-solution, which generalizes "$\mathcal{C}$-subsolution" to some extent and is well-defined for fully general $p$-Hessian equations. Based on pseudo-solutions, we prove the $\mathrm{C}^0$ estimates, first-order estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations, and the corresponding second-order estimates when $p\in\{2, n-1, n\}$, under sharp conditions -- we don't impose curvature restrictions, convexity conditions or "MTW condition" on our main results. Some other conclusions related to a priori estimates and different kinds of "subsolutions" are also given, including estimates for "semi-convex" solutions and when there exists a pseudo-solution.</description>

      <title>Approximate control of the marked length spectrum by short geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The marked length spectrum (MLS) of a closed negatively curved manifold $(M, g)$ is known to determine the metric $g$ under various circumstances. We show that in these cases, (approximate) values of the MLS on a sufficiently large finite set approximately determine the metric. Our approach is to recover the hypotheses of our main theorems in arXiv:2203.12128, namely multiplicative closeness of the MLS functions on the entire set of closed geodesics of $M$. We use mainly dynamical tools and arguments, but take great care to show the constants involved depend only on concrete geometric information about the given Riemannian metrics, such as the dimension, sectional curvature bounds, and injectivity radii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of bounded solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on reduced, locally irreducible compact K\"{a}hler spaces. This in particular implies that any singular K\"{a}hler-Einstein potentials constructed in \cite{EGZ09} and \cite{Tsuji88, TianZhang06, ST17} are continuous. We also provide an affirmative answer to a conjecture in \cite{EGZ09} by showing that a resolution of any compact normal K\"{a}hler space satisfies the continuous approximation property. Finally, we settle the continuity of the potentials of the weak K\"{a}hler-Ricci flows \cite{ST17, GLZ20} on compact K\"{a}hler varieties with log terminal singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a generic Riemannian metric on a compact manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$ all geodesic loops based at a fixed point have no self-intersections. We also show that for an open and dense subset of the space of Riemannian metrics on an $n$-disc with $n \ge 3$ and with a strictly convex boundary there are $n$ geometrically distinct orthogonal geodesic chords without self-intersections. We use a perturbation result for intersecting geodesic segments of the author and a genericity statement due to Bettiol and Giamb\`o and existence results for orthogonal geodesic chords by Giamb\`o, Giannoni, and Piccione.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the hyperbolic marked energy spectrum and entropy for $k$-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labourie raised the question of determining the possible asymptotics for the growth rate of compact $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, in negatively curved $3$-manifolds, indicating the possibility of a theory of thermodynamical formalism for this class of surfaces. Motivated by this question and by analogous results for the geodesic flow, we prove a number of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of high energy $k$-surfaces, especially in relation to the curvature of the ambient space.
  First, we determine a rigid upper bound for the growth rate of quasi-Fuchsian $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, and with asymptotically round limit set, subject to a lower bound on the sectional curvature of the ambient space. We also study the marked energy spectrum for $k$-surfaces, proving a number of domination and rigidity theorems in this context. Finally, we show that the marked area and energy spectra for $k$-surfaces in $3$-dimensional manifolds of negative curvature are asymptotic if and only if the sectional curvature is constant.</description>

      <title>Invariance of subbundles and nonholonomic trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the comparison of nonholonomic mechanics and constrained variational mechanics, invariant affine subbundles arise in the determination of the initial conditions where the two methods yield the same trajectories. Motivated by this, differential conditions are considered for invariant affine subbundles as they arise in the comparison of nonholonomic and constrained variational mechanics. First of all, the formal integrability of the resulting linear partial differential equation is determined using Spencer cohomology. Second, iterative formulae are provided that permit the determination of the largest invariant affine subbundle invariant under an affine vector field. Finally, the problem of a disc rolling on an inclined plane with no-slip is considered as an example to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <title>Compact Quantum Homogeneous K\"ahler Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative K\"ahler structures were recently introduced as an algebraic framework for studying noncommutative complex geometry on quantum homogeneous spaces. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a \emph{compact quantum homogeneous K\"ahler space} which gives a natural set of compatibility conditions between covariant K\"ahler structures and Woronowicz's theory of compact quantum groups. Each such object admits a Hilbert space completion possessing a remarkably rich yet tractable structure. The analytic behaviour of the associated Dolbeault-Dirac operators is moulded by the complex geometry of the underlying calculus. In particular, twisting the Dolbeault-Dirac operator by a negative Hermitian holomorphic module is shown to give a Fredholm operator if and only if the top anti-holomorphic cohomology group is finite-dimensional. In this case, the operator's index coincides with the twisted holomorphic Euler characteristic of the underlying noncommutative complex structure. The irreducible quantum flag manifolds, endowed with their Heckenberger-Kolb calculi, are presented as motivating examples.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's ``moving wall'' model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are \emph{pairwise isocausal} on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections between the models and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion for when the isocausality descends to the compactified spacetimes. In the absence of equivariance, the covering result does not imply global isocausality, and at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>
