      <title>Covariant phase space and $L_\infty$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a symplectic structure for the phase space of a generic Lagrangian field theory expressed in the framework of $L_\infty$ algebras. The symplectic structure does not require explicit knowledge of the derivative content of the Lagrangian, and therefore is applicable to nonlocal models, such as string field theory, where traditional constructions are difficult to apply. We test our proposal in a number of examples ranging from general relativity to $p$-adic string theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thermalization in the large $N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature.
  We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Emergence of CY Triple Intersection Numbers in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To give more credence to the M-theoretic Emergence Proposal it is important to show that also classical kinetic terms in a low energy effective action arise as a quantum effect from integrating out light towers of states. We show that for compactifications of type IIA on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the classical weak coupling Yukawa couplings, which are the triple intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau threefold, can be obtained from the 1/2-BPS protected one-loop Schwinger integral over $D2$-$D0$ bound states, after employing a novel regularization for the final infinite sum of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. Approaching the problem in a consecutive manner from 6D decompactification over emergent string to the ultimate M-theory limits, we arrive at a mathematically concrete regularization that involves finite distance degeneration limits of Calabi-Yau threefolds in an intriguing way. We test and challenge this proposal by the concrete determination of the periods around such degeneration points for threefolds with one K\"ahler modulus and the two examples $\mathbb P_{1,1,1,6,9}[18]$ and $\mathbb P_{1,1,2,2,6}[12]$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Memory in the Post-Minkowskian Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the nonlinear gravitational memory waveform for the scattering of two compact objects in General Relativity at leading order in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We use the scattering-amplitudes-based representation of the gravitational waveform, which naturally expresses the nonlinear memory as the contribution of soft gravitons emitted by the gravitational waves themselves. We perform the calculation by applying a multipolar decomposition to the waveform and using the reverse unitarity method to obtain explicit exact-in-velocity predictions. We validate the results by calculating the corresponding velocity-expanded post-Newtonian multipoles, finding perfect agreement. Our results complete the knowledge of the gauge-invariant non-analytic-in-frequency part of the $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$ multipolar waveform, thus providing a useful benchmark for future calculations of this quantity.</description>

      <title>Holography with Null Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key issues in holography is going beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the $T \overline{T}$ deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Ambiguities in the generation of CFJ-terms in a 5-dimensional extension of QED in one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Lorentz symmetry breaking extension of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), incorporating 5-dimensional CPT-odd terms at the one-loop level. Employing an independent regularization method, we systematically separate the divergences into regularization-independent contributions and regularization-dependent (surface terms). We demonstrate that these surface terms, potentially contributing to the radiative generation of Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) terms, remain undetermined even when imposing the Ward-Takahashi identity. Our results are consistent with existing literature and emphasize the necessity of a careful and consistent treatment of regularization ambiguities in quantum field theories involving symmetry breaking extensions.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-Symmetric Box Operator and $\alpha^{\prime}$-Corrections with Riemann Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Double Field Theory, we construct an $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric d'Alembertian, or box operator, that is applicable to tensors of arbitrary rank. Parameterized by the Riemannian metric and the $B$-field, the operator naturally incorporates the Riemann curvature tensor and the $H$-flux. When applied to the massless string sector, it produces a consistent stringy wave equation under an $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric harmonic gauge condition. Furthermore, the one-loop integral of the massive string modes, whose kinetic terms are governed by the box operator, yields Riemann curvature $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrections. Yet, the momentum integral generically breaks the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Complexity of PXP scars revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a quantum quench scenario in which either a scarring or thermalizing initial state evolves under the PXP Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we study the time evolution of spread complexity and related quantities in the Krylov basis. We find that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, as functions of the iteration number $n$, exhibit a characteristic arched growth and decay, followed by erratic oscillations which we refer to as buttress. The arched profile predominantly arises from contributions within the quantum many-body scar subspace, while the buttress is linked to thermalization dynamics. To explain this behavior, we utilize the representation theory of $\mathfrak{s}l_3(\mathbb{C})$, allowing us to decompose the PXP Hamiltonian into a linear component and a residual part. The linear term governs the formation and width of the arch, and we observe that that there exists a threshold of arch width which determines whether a given initial state exhibits scarring. Meanwhile, the residual term accounts qualitatively for the emergence of the buttress. We estimate an upper bound for the extent of the buttress using Lucas numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that spread complexity oscillates periodically over time for scarred initial states, whereas such oscillations are suppressed in thermalizing cases.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a string field theory for open N=2 strings with an A_infinity algebra structure. Starting from the BRST cohomology relative to the U(1) anti-ghost zero-mode, we generalize [arXiv:1312.2948] and constructed all interacting vertices recursively and without singularity. We also show that our string field theory reproduces the correct perturbative S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Gravity Duality of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network has been attracting increasing attention for its role in driving the artificial intelligence revolution and enabling profound insights into gravity. This paper investigates the gravity dual of the conformal field theory defined on a network (AdS/NCFT). A typical network, consisting of edges and nodes, is dual to a spacetime with branches and connecting branes, which we refer to as Net-branes. We demonstrate that the junction condition on the Net-brane results in energy conservation at the network node, providing strong support for our proposal of AdS/NCFT.
  We find that the spectrum of gravitational Kaluza-Klein modes on the Net-brane is a combination of the spectra from the AdS/BCFT with Neumann boundary conditions and Dirichlet/Conformal boundary conditions, corresponding to the isolated and transparent modes, respectively. We study two-point functions for NCFTs and provide examples, such as free fields and AdS/NCFT with tensionless Net-branes. We propose that the RT surfaces intersect at the same point on the Net-brane for connected subsystems within the network and verify this with the strong additivity and monotonicity of entanglement entropy. We establish that the network entropy, defined as the difference in entanglement between NCFT and BCFT, is always non-negative and effectively illustrates the network's complexity. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic perspective of the shortest path problem and reveal its relation to the shortest geodesic in bulk and the holographic two-point correlators of massive operators.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from integrability in $\mathcal{N}=2$ orbifold theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides solving the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, integrability also provides us with tools to compute the structure constants of the theory, most prominently through the hexagon formalism. We show that, with minor modifications, this formalism can also be applied to orbifolds of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, which are integrable theories in their own right. To substantiate this claim, we test our results against a direct gauge-theory calculation at tree-level. We focus here on a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_M$-orbifold theories. BPS correlators in these theories have recently been investigated with independent localisation techniques and a tentative matching with wrapping corrections in the hexagon formalism was observed. Together with our weak-coupling evidence, this suggests that a full determination of the structure constants of orbifold theories at finite coupling may be within reach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.</description>

      <title>On the local thermodynamic relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by providing two specific examples, that the local differential thermodynamic relations used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, do not hold even at global thermodynamic equilibrium, where the expression of the entropy current is totally unambiguous. We show, by using a rigorous quantum statistical method, that for massless free fermions and massive free fermions with rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium, the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential differs from the spin density and acquires a correction of the same order. Therefore, for an accurate determination of the constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional method of assuming differential thermodynamic relations is not appropriate.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics with antisymmetric spin tensors and an extension of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a formulation of relativistic spin hydrodynamics with totally antisymmetric spin tensors that satisfy the Frenkel-Mathisson-Pirani condition. In our proposed spin hydrodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled by the spin-induced corrections in the heat flow, the viscous tensor, and the antisymmetric part of the energy-momentum tensor. These corrections are interpreted as the inverse spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect in the nonrelativistic limit. We show that our evolution equation for the spin density is interpreted as an extension of the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation known in relativistic many-body systems, including the Thomas precession term, the spin-rotation term, and new coupling terms between spin and hydrodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Test-time Scaling Techniques in Theoretical Physics -- A Comparison of Methods on the TPBench Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel, symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification for tackling complex scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Bosonized theory of de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillation in Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvA) of a 2d Fermi liquid remains poorly understood, due to the $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ contribution to the oscillations of grand potential from the oscillatory part of the fermionic self energy, which has no known closed-form solution. In this work, we solve this problem via coadjoint-orbit bosonization of the Fermi surface. Compared with the fermionic formalism, the issue of the oscillatory self energy is circumvented. As an effective field theory, Landau parameters $F_{n}$ directly enter the theory. We use the bosonized theory to derive the energies of cyclotron resonance and specific heat, which are consistent with Fermi liquid theory. Via a mode expansion, we show that the problem of dHvA is reduced to 0+1D quantum mechanics. We obtain analytic expressions for the behavior of dHvA at low and high temperatures, which deviate from the well-known Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. We contrast this behavior with that of 3d Fermi liquids, for which we show such deviations are parametrically small. We discuss the effects of disorder on dHvA within the bosonized theory.</description>

      <title>Excising Cauchy Horizons with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged and/or rotating black holes in General Relativity feature Cauchy horizons, which indicate a breakdown of predictability in the theory. Focusing on spherically symmetric charged black holes, we remark that the inevitability of Reissner-Nordstrom Cauchy horizon is due to the divergent electromagnetic self-energy of point charges. We demonstrate that any causal theory of nonlinear electrodynamics that regularizes the point charge self-energy also eliminates Cauchy horizons for weakly charged black holes. These black holes feature one (event) horizon and a spacelike singularity, analogous to the Schwarzschild metric. An example with Born-Infeld electrodynamics illustrates how this gives rise to an upper bound on the charge, which we compare with known bounds.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of large quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre universe are presented.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a hitherto unknown class of RG-stable relations between parameters of bosonic field theories have been identified and dubbed as the r0 or 'GOOFy' symmetries. Here, 1-loop properties of the r0 invariant 2-Higgs Doublet Model and a minimal symmetric model are discussed. It is concluded that the symmetry is present at the 1-loop provided the UV cut-off squared transforms non-trivially under r0. The minimal model requires the presence of two real fields.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Generation and Detection in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production and detection of gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). In this theory, GWs exhibit five propagating modes: one scalar, two vector, and two tensor modes. Unlike General Relativity, the gravitational field equations in GQFT involve both symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, governed by their respective energy-momentum tensors, both of which can act as sources for GW radiation. By solving the linearized gravitational equations, we derive general analytic expressions for the different GW degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor generates scalar and tensor GWs through the trace and traceless parts of the quadrupole moment, respectively. In contrast, the antisymmetric stress tensor induces scalar and vector GWs with enhanced coupling strengths. We examine two illustrative examples: a black hole binary with a slightly elliptical orbit, which produces scalar GWs, and a neutron star binary where one component has a net spin aligned with its velocity, leading to vector GW emission. Finally, we study the detectability of these GW polarizations by analyzing their signatures in GW detectors. Our findings indicate that current observatories can detect both scalar and tensor modes, while a newly designed detector would be required to probe vector GWs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, quantum theory of a real massive scalar field in the background of a traversable wormhole is examined. The wormhole is supposed to connect two different universes, as a particular example the simplest Ellis wormhole is considered. It is shown that the resulting theory possesses a doubling of quantum states parameterized by the same value of asymptotic momentum, two different sets of such degenerate states are localized in different universes. This is a consequence of the topological structure of the wormhole spacetime, which is the same as the topological structure of the Schwarzschild spacetime providing a similar degeneracy of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Quantisation of Higher Time-Derivative Theories via Non-Unitary Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.</description>

Abstract: We study stochastic inflation in the presence of higher-curvature terms non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on quadratic curvature invariants, we single out the Gauss--Bonnet term which is known to avoid ghosts, while having non-trivial effects on the background and scalar mode evolution when coupled to the scalar field. Stochastic Klein--Gordon and Langevin equations are derived in the presence of the Gauss--Bonnet coupling, and their slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll limits are studied. By using first-passage time method, scalar power spectrum is computed in these limits. Stochastic evolution of a Gauss--Bonnet-coupled spectator field in de Sitter vacuum is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a field theory capable of describing the critical properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions beyond the leading order radiative corrections or in the number of loops (effective field theories limited only to leading order were recently defined in literature). These systems present defects, inhomogeneities and impurities as opposed to ideal ones which are perfect, homogeneous and pure. We compute the values of the critical exponents of the theory beyond leading order and compare with their corresponding experimental measured results. The results show some interplay between nonideal effects and fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We lay the foundations for a general approach to nonassociative spectral geometry as an extension of Connes' noncommutative geometry by explaining how to construct finite-dimensional, discrete spectral geometries with exceptional symmetry, and gauge covariant Dirac operators. We showcase an explicit construction of a geometry corresponding to the internal space of a $G_2\times G_2$ gauge theory with charged scalar content and scalar representations restricted by novel conditions arising from the associative properties of the coordinate algebra. Our construction motivates a new definition of bimodules over nonassociative algebras and a novel form of bimodule over semi-simple octonion algebras.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry breaking in 1D spin chains and 1+1D field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1) ``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x, S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning. Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest. The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.</description>

      <title>Strings, Virasoro Sandwiches and Worldsheet Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization of free bosonic closed string theory and observe that the physicality of states requires vanishing of the worldsheet Virasoro algebra generators sandwiched between any two physical states. This requirement yields four classes of physical states, depending on discrete worldsheet symmetries: parity and time reversal. The usual string states which are highest weight states of the Virasoro algebra, preserve both, while the other new three classes break one or both. We apply our formulation to an accelerated worldsheet with horizons, initiating the worldsheet formulation of a thermal string theory and strings probing horizon of black holes.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory for self-interacting relativistic Luttinger fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quantum field theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions and local self-interaction in scalar channels. For an understanding of possible low-energy phases, we first classify the set of mass terms arising from scalar fermion bilinears. For large flavor numbers, we show that each of our models features a coupling branch in which the theory is asymptotically free. In order to address the long-range behavior, we use mean-field theory which is exact in the limit of large flavor numbers. We identify two models which undergo dimensional transmutation, interconnecting the asymptotically free high-energy regime with an ordered low-energy phase sustaining a vacuum condensate. We also study the analytic structure of the Luttinger-fermionic propagator in the various possible gapped phases.</description>

      <title>Binary Kerr black-hole scattering at 2PM from quantum higher-spin Compton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum higher-spin theory applied to Compton amplitudes has proven to be surprisingly useful for elucidating Kerr black hole dynamics. Here we apply the framework to compute scattering amplitudes and observables for a binary system of two rotating black holes, at second post-Minkowskian order, and to all orders in the spin-multipole expansion for certain quantities. Starting from the established three-point and conjectured Compton quantum amplitudes, the infinite-spin limit gives classical amplitudes that serves as building block that we feed into the unitarity method to construct the 2-to-2 one-loop amplitude. We give scalar box, vector box, and scalar triangle coefficients to all orders in spin, where the latter are expressed in terms of Bessel-like functions. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, the classical 2PM impulse is computed, and in parallel we work out the scattering angle and eikonal phase. We give novel all-orders-in-spin formulae for certain contributions, and the remaining ones are given up to ${\cal O}(S^{11})$. Since Kerr 2PM dynamics beyond ${\cal O}(S^{\ge 5})$ is as of yet not completely settled, this work serves as a useful reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>A holographic realization of correlation and mutual information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The status of the inequality existing between mutual information and (normalized) thermal two-point connected correlation function, namely, $I(A:B)\ge\frac{(\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}\mathcal{O}_{B}}_{\beta}-\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}}_{\beta}\expval{\mathcal{O}_{B}}_{\beta})^2}{2\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}^2}_{\beta}\expval{\mathcal{O}_{B}^2}_{\beta}}$ has been explicitly probed by using the gauge/gravity correspondence. In the holographic analysis, the geodesic approximation for heavy operators ($\Delta\sim mR$) has been used. We observe that the study leads to some non-trivial insights depending upon the method of calculating the thermal object $\expval{\mathcal{O}^2}_{\beta}$. For a particular computed result of $\expval{\mathcal{O}^2}_{\beta}$ we propose that all of the existing quantum mechanical dependencies (correlations) and classical correlations between the subsystems $A$ and $B$ vanishes at two different separation lengths, namely, $sT|c$ and $sT|_I$ where $sT|_I&gt;sT|_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>Influence Phase of a dS Observer II: Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our proposal for static patch holography made in part I (arXiv:2309.07290) to the case of electromagnetism. Using the on-shell action on de Sitter Schwinger-Keldysh (dS-SK) geometry, we derive the influence phase of an observer in dS$_{d+1}$ interacting with bulk electromagnetic fields. This influence phase, computed with appropriate boundary conditions and counterterms, encodes the physics of electromagnetic radiation reaction and corresponding dS Hawking radiation. The self-force is rendered finite through holographic renormalisation. In the short-time limit, we reproduce electromagnetic flat space radiation reaction ala Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac, along with cosmological corrections. We give a fully covariantised expression for this radiation reaction in several even spacetime dimensions. In this process, we also extend many existing results to cosmological spacetimes: multipole expansions including smearing effects, non-relativistic expansion for electromagnetism, and classical renormalisation in odd spacetime dimensions. Further, we review and extend many properties of vector spherical harmonics(VSHs) in arbitrary dimensions, explain the relation between spherical and cartesian VSH, and derive an addition theorem for VSHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the light-cone gauge formalism to study interactions of point particles with massless higher-spin fields. By analysing the light-cone consistency conditions at the subleading order in higher-spin fields, we find that no local interactions of point particles with chiral higher-spin fields are possible. Considering that chiral higher-spin theories form inevitable closed subsectors of any consistent massless higher-spin theories in flat space, this conclusion holds more generally, in particular, it applies to putative parity-invariant completions of chiral higher-spin theories. Besides that, we argue that our result implies that Riemannian geometry cannot be extended to spaces with non-trivial higher-spin fields, in particular, there is no higher-spin extension of space-time interval. In the present paper we focus on a case of a massless particle, while a more technical massive case will be analysed in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: We study in detail the internal structure of rotationally invariant higher-charge Abelian-Higgs vortices. The symmetry of the normal modes close to the critical regime for type II vortices determines the possible disintegration channels. The full internal mode structure is discussed, finding modes that conserve the vortex symmetry (Derrick type modes) and modes whose symmetry differs (multipolar modes).</description>

Abstract: The Coulomb branch of the N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory is described by a D3-brane in the bulk of AdS_5 x S^5. We show that boundary conditions on this D3-brane preserve integrability of the AdS string. For that matter we construct dynamical and spectral parameter dependent reflection matrix that encodes an infinite number of conserved charges on the worldsheet of an open string ending on the D-brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and holographic properties of charged and rotating quantum black holes in a doubly holographic braneworld setup. These quantum black holes are derived from the anti-de Sitter C-metric and are exact solutions to a semi-classical gravitational theory which incorporates all orders of the backreaction of quantum fields on spacetime. The inclusion of both charge and rotation extends and generalizes previous studies. The thermodynamics and critical behavior of the black holes are examined from the bulk, brane, and boundary perspectives, and we demonstrate that the inclusion of either charge or rotation removes the re-entrant phase transitions seen in the neutral-static case. The critical exponents of the system are calculated using numerical methods and found to differ from the standard mean field theory values for the neutral-static black holes' re-entrant phase transitions, but in agreement with mean-field theory for the phase transitions of the black holes with charge and rotation. Additionally, to test the validity of the semiclassical treatment, we study a mass-gap energy scale $M_{\rm gap}$ to identify regimes where quantum fluctuations of spacetime geometry are expected to become significant and speculate about a connection with weak cosmic censorship gedankenexperiments. We also generalize the quantum Penrose inequality and the quantum reverse isoperimetric inequality to include charge and rotation. Finally, we compute a renormalized gyromagnetic ratio and analyze it in the limit of large backreaction.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Nucleation and Off-Equilibrium Effects in High-Temperature Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study real-time nucleation in perturbative high-temperature quantum field theories. Specifically, we incorporate the evolution of thermally fluctuating plasma driven out of equilibrium by nucleation. This plasma forms the thermal bath for the nucleating bubbles, and its off-equilibrium dynamics backreact on the bubbles, modifying the nucleation rate. Utilizing kinetic Boltzmann descriptions for the plasma particles, we derive that the nucleation rate in high-temperature quantum field theories is described by Langer's rate formula with effects arising from the off-equilibrium plasma, unaccounted for in Linde's thermal rate. Importantly, we establish a connection to equilibrium computations of nucleation rates, particularly with the effective field theory approach, showing that they correctly capture the leading parts of the logarithm of the rate. We also show that the dominant modifications to the nucleation rate from a light bosonic quantum field arise from its corresponding long-wavelength classical modes, rather than the associated hard particles. This work provides a foundation for further studies of off-equilibrium effects in nucleation rates for realistic Standard Model extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model is proposed, where the Higgs field is valued in the complex projective plane ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, rather than ${\mathbb{C}}^2$. Its geometry is consistent with $U(2) \simeq (SU(2) \times U(1))/ \mathbb{Z}_2$ electroweak gauge symmetry. The leading terms in the Lagrangian, beyond those of the Standard Model, are much more tightly constrained than in general SMEFTs, and the custodial $SO(4)$ symmetry of the Higgs sector is mildly broken. The predicted tree-level deviations from Standard Model phenomenology depend on a single large mass parameter $M$. Current experimental data imply that $M$ is a few TeV or larger.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor Theorem with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the essential properties of gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) based on spin gauge symmetry, using the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as an example. A constraint equation for the field strength of the gravigauge field is derived, serving as a gravitization equation within the spin-related gravigauge spacetime. This equation reveals how gravitational effects emerge from the non-commutative relation of the gravigauge derivative operator. By transmuting the action from gravigauge spacetime to Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that translational invariance results in a vanishing energy-momentum tensor in GQFT when the equations of motion are applied to all fundamental fields, including the gravigauge field. This extends the conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor in quantum field theory to a cancellation law of the energy-momentum tensor in GQFT. As a result, an equivalence between the general gravitational equation and the zero energy-momentum tensor theorem naturally arises in GQFT. Certain aspects of the Poincar\'e gauge theory are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, a GQFT incorporating the Chern-Simons action in three-dimensional spacetime is developed, based on the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS(1,2) and the global Poincar\'e symmetry PO(1,2). This framework provides a basis for exploring its connection to Witten's perspective on three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in structural stability as applied to key topics in general relativity. For a nonlinear dynamical system arising from the Einstein equations by a symmetry reduction, bifurcation theory fully characterizes the set of all stable perturbations of the system, known as the `versal unfolding'. This construction yields a comprehensive classification of qualitatively distinct solutions and their metamorphoses into new topological forms, parametrized by the codimension of the bifurcation in each case. We illustrate these ideas through bifurcations in the simplest Friedmann models, the Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole, the evolution of causal geodesic congruences in cosmology and black-hole spacetimes, crease flow on event horizons, and the Friedmann-Lema\^itre equations. Finally, we list open problems and briefly discuss emerging aspects such as partial differential equation stability of versal families, the general relativity landscape, and potential connections between gravitational versal unfoldings and those of the Maxwell, Dirac, and Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>The effective phase space and $e$-folding of the Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky model of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For zero spatial curvature, cosmological phase space of Starobinsky and extended Starobinsky inflationary model show three apparent attractors; the fixed angle attractor in the large field limit, the final attractor representing reheating phase in the small field region, and the apparent attractor corresponding to the slow-roll condition connecting between the large-field and small-field region. To consider the total $e$-folding likelihood of the model, Remmen-Carroll conserved measure is constructed and normalized. Using the measure, the total e-folding number $N$ and its expectation value $\left\langle N \right\rangle$ are calculated. Our results show that most classical slow-roll trajectories which intersect the Planck surface have $N&lt;60$, and $\phi_{\rm UV}&gt;5.5 M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ is required for $N&gt;60$. It is found that for $\phi_{\rm UV}\in [5.22,5.50]M^{*}_{\rm Pl}$ which satisfies the constraint on the spectral index, $n_s = 0.9658 \pm 0.0040\,\,\,(68\%\,\,{\rm CL})$, the expectation value $\langle N \rangle \simeq 3.5 - 4$ for trajectories intersecting the Planck surface in the Starobinsky model. For extended Starobinsky model with additional $R^3$ term parametrized by a coupling parameter $\alpha$, the expectation value when inflation starts from the top of the potential shifts to $\left\langle N \right\rangle = 4.025,4.336$ for $\alpha = 10^{-4},6.5\times 10^{-5}$ respectively. In the Starobinsky model even at very large inflaton cutoff $\phi_{\rm UV}$ where the field value is super-Planckian, the energy density from the (saturating) inflaton potential and the Hubble parameter are still sub-Planckian and therefore the inflation occurs within the semi-classical regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of 2-adic Schr\"odinger equations is the scaling limit of certain continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs). Practically, a discretization of such an equation gives a CTQMC. As a practical result, we construct new types of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on graphs using two symmetric matrices. One matrix describes the transport between nodes in one direction, while the second describes the transport between nodes in the opposite direction. This construction includes, as a particular case, the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) and the role of the hypothesis of the discreteness of space. The connection between 2-adic QM and CTQWs shows that 2-adic QM has a physical meaning. 2-Adic QM is a nonlocal theory because the Hamiltonians used are nonlocal operators, and consequently, spooky actions at a distance are allowed. However, this theory is not a mathematical toy. The experimental confirmation of the violation of Bell's inequality implies that this theory allows realism. We pointed out several new research problems connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size $R$, angular frequency $\Omega$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. We demonstrate that consistency between the thermodynamics of the model and the Tolman-Ehrenfest law is achieved in the limit of large volume. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma, such as the moment of inertia and the $K_n$ shape coefficients describing the response of the thermodynamic potential with respect to the increase of angular velocity $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the passive scalar in decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as the spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature with a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is a unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the irregular singular point of the wave equation for a massive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a massive scalar field in a fixed Schwarzschild background, the radial wave equation obeyed by Fourier modes is first studied. After reducing such a radial wave equation to its normal form, we first study approximate solutions in the neighborhood of the origin, horizon and point at infinity, and then we relate the radial with the Heun equation, obtaining local solutions at the regular singular points. Moreover, we obtain the full asymptotic expansion of the local solution in the neighborhood of the irregular singular point at infinity. We also obtain and study the associated integral representation of the massive scalar field. Eventually, the technique developed for the irregular singular point is applied to the homogeneous equation associated with the inhomogeneous Zerilli equation for gravitational perturbations in a Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <title>Bound States of the Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical significance and spectral stability of black hole quasinormal modes is fundamental to high-precision spectroscopy with future gravitational wave detectors. Inspired by Mashhoon's idea of relating quasinormal modes of black holes with their equivalent bound states in an inverted potential, we investigate, for the first time, energy levels and eigenfunctions of the Schwarzschild black hole quantitatively. While quasinormal modes describe the characteristic damped oscillations of a black hole, the bound states of the inverted potential are qualitatively more similar to those of the hydrogen atom. Although the physical interpretation of these states may initially be of more academic interest, it furthers our understanding of open problems related to quasinormal modes in a similar spirit to Maggiore's interpretation of the Schwarzschild quasinormal mode spectrum. One surprising insight from the explicit calculation of bound states is that eigenfunctions corresponding to quasinormal mode overtones become rapidly delocalized and extremely loosely bound. This observation raises immediate questions about the common interpretation of quasinormal modes as excitations of the lightring region. Closely related, as a second application, we also explore the spectral stability of bound states and demonstrate that they can provide complementary insights into the quasinormal mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a bosonic anomaly emerging in the quantum harmonic oscillator, whose partition function is rigorously identified as the Chern character via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, establishing a new connection among statistical mechanics, anomaly, Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Gromov-Witten theory. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physical sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime by using Grothentic-Riemann-Roch theorem. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete non-SUSY manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly. Furthermore, we arrive at Gromov-Witten theory through a more direct and physically intuitive approach. As a result, the internal energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator serves as a bridge linking two key concepts in physics -- statistical mechanics and anomalies -- with three fundamental mathematical frameworks: the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, and Gromov-Witten theory.</description>
