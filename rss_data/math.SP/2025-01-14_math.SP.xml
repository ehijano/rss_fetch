      <title>Constructing Riemannian metrics with prescribed nodal sets for Laplacian eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ ovals in $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that there is a Riemannian metric $g$ over $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a Laplacian eigenfunction whose zero set is $C$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the $k$-th eigenvalue for $n\leq k \leq \alpha_1 n$. We also have that $\lambda\operatorname{Vol}_g\left(\mathbb{S}^2\right) = \Theta(n)$.
  Additionally, assuming $C$ can be drawn as a topological minor of the $m\times m$ grid graph, we show that there is an infinitesimal perturbation of the round metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a corresponding Laplacian eigenfunction $f$ with eigenvalue $\Theta(m^2)$ such that the zero set of $f$ is equivalent to $C$.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps and applications to preserver problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ let $\mathcal{X}_n$ be either the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices, the set $N_n$ of all $n \times n$ normal matrices, or any of the matrix Lie groups $\mathrm{GL}(n)$, $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$. We first give a short and elementary argument that for two positive integers $m$ and $n$ there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_m$ (i.e.\ $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(X))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$. Moreover, in that case we have the equality of characteristic polynomials $k_{\phi(X)}(\cdot) = k_{X}(\cdot)^\frac{m}{n}$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$, which in particular shows that $\phi$ preserves spectra. Using this we show that whenever $n \geq 3$, any continuous commutativity preserving and spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_n$ is of the form $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)T^{-1}$ or $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)^tT^{-1}$, for some $T\in \mathrm{GL}(n)$. The analogous results fail for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(n)$, and slightly more elaborate versions hold for the spaces of semisimple elements in either $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n)$, where a qualitatively new (and surprising) phenomenon arises: the map sending $SNS^{-1}$ to $S^{-1}NS$ for positive invertible $S$ and normal $N$ is also an example. As a consequence, we also recover (a strengthened version of) \v{S}emrl's influential characterization of Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ via preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Witten-Laplacian with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a compact connected Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary, we establish an effective procedure, by which we can calculate all the coefficients of the spectral asymptotic formula of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Witten-Laplacian with potential. In particular, by computing the full symbol of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map we explicitly give the first four coefficients. They are spectral invariants, which provide precise information concerning the volume, curvatures, drifting function and potential.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of the free Jacobi process with equal rank projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free Jacobi process is the radial part of the compression of the free unitary Brownian motion by two free orthogonal projections. In this paper, we determine the characteristic curves of the partial differential equation satisfied by its spectral distribution when both projections have the same rank $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Doing so leads for any fixed time $t &gt;0$ to an expression of the moment generating function in a neighborhood of the origin, extending our previous results valid for $\alpha = 1/2$. Moreover, the obtained characteristic curves are encoded by an $\alpha$-deformation of the $\xi$-transform of the spectral distribution of the free unitary Brownian motion, of which we study mapping properties. We also prove a dynamical version of a recent identity pointed out by T. Kunisky and relating the stationary distributions of the free Jacobi processes corresponding to the set of parameters $(\alpha, \alpha)$ and $(1/2,\alpha)$. Actually, our dynamical version relates the Cauchy-Stieltjes transforms of the densities of the finite time spectral distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Steklov eigenvalue of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) with smooth boundary. For compact M , we establish a Cheeger-type inequality for the first Steklov eigenvalue by the isocapacitary constant. For non-compact M , we estimate the bottom of the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator by the isocapacitary constant.</description>

      <title>Geometric Scattering on Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering transform is a multilayered, wavelet-based transform initially introduced as a model of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has played a foundational role in our understanding of these networks' stability and invariance properties. Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in extending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such as graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep learning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in this new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering transform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.
  In this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering on measure spaces. Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric scattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as directed graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new criterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be invariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the scattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties. Additionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly sampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a data-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform approximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold. Moreover, we use a diffusion-maps based approach to prove quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence of one of these approximations as the number of sample points tends to infinity. Lastly, we showcase the utility of our method on spherical images, directed graphs, and on high-dimensional single-cell data.</description>

      <title>Resonant forms at zero for dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study resonant differential forms at zero for transitive Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms, $\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a $\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto [\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic $1$-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is $-\chi(M)-1$.</description>
