      <title>Connectivity of contraction-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction-critical graphs came from the study of minimal counterexamples to Hadwiger's conjecture. A graph is $k$-contraction-critical if it is $k$-chromatic, but any proper minor is $(k-1)$-colorable. It is a long-standing result of Mader that $k$-contraction-critical graphs are $7$-connected for $k\ge7$. In this paper, we provide the improvement of Mader's result for small values of $k$. We show that $k$-contraction-critical graphs are $8$-connected for $k\ge17$, $9$-connected for $k\ge29$, and $10$-connected for $k\ge41$. As a corollary of one of our intermediate results, we also prove that every $30$-connected graph is $4$-linked.</description>

      <title>On a pair of three-colored (mod 10) partition identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a pair of (mod 10) partition identities. The sum sides involve three-colored partitions into distinct parts, while the product sides are the generating functions for distinct partitions times the Rogers-Ramanujan products. Our proofs make heavy use of Maple to verify that functional equations are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure. VI. Distant paths across a disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menger's theorem says that, for $k\ge0$, if $S, T$ are sets of vertices in a graph $G$, then either there are $k + 1$ vertex-disjoint paths between $S$ and $T$, or there is a set X of at most $k$ vertices such that every $S$-$T$ path passes through $X$. The ``coarse Menger conjecture'' proposed a generalization of Menger's theorem for paths that are far apart: for all $k, c$ there exists $\ell$, such that for every graph $G$ and subsets $S, T \subset V (G)$, either there are $k + 1$ paths between $S$ and $T$, pairwise with distance more than $c$, or there is a set $X \subset V (G)$ of at most $k$ vertices such that every $S$-$T$ path has distance at most $\ell$ from $X$. This is known to be false, but may be true if $G$ is planar. Here we show that it is true if $G$ is planar and all vertices in $S \cup T$ are on the infinite region. In this case, we also obtain a linear-time algorithm to test for the existence of $k+ 1$ paths between $S$ and $T$, pairwise with distance more than $c$.</description>

      <title>Covering and labeling generalizations of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove multiple generalizations of Fan's combinatorial labeling result for sphere triangulations. This can be seen as a comprehensive extension of the Borsuk--Ulam theorem. In typical applications, the Borsuk--Ulam theorem gives complexity bounds in a suitable sense, whereas our extension additionally provides insight into the structure of objects satisfying the complexity bound. This structure is governed by order types of finite point sets in Euclidean space and more generally by the intersection combinatorics of faces under continuous maps from the simplex. We develop some of those applications for sphere coverings, Kneser-type colorings, Hall-type results for hypergraphs, and hyperplane mass partitions, among other consequences. We provide a new proof of the topological Hall theorem and extend it into a result that simultaneously generalizes hypergraph Hall theorems and topological lower bounds for chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>On a Conjecture about Comparing the First and Second Zagreb Indices of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with order $n(G)$, size $m(G)$, first Zagreb index $M_1(G)$, and second Zagreb index $M_2(G)$. More than twenty years ago, it was conjectured that $\frac{M_1(G)}{n(G)} \leq \frac{M_2(G)}{m(G)}$. Later, Hansen and Vuki\v{c}evi\'c demonstrated that this conjecture does not hold for general graphs but is valid for chemical graphs. In this paper, as an extension of the study of chemical graphs, we investigate graphs in which the difference between the minimum and maximum degrees is at most $3$. We prove that any graph in this class that serves as a counterexample to the stated conjecture must have a minimum degree of $2$ and a maximum degree of $5$. Furthermore, we present infinitely many connected graphs that serve as counterexamples to this conjecture, all of which have a minimum degree of 2, a maximum degree of 5, and an order of at least 218.</description>

      <title>Sign-coherence and tropical sign pattern for rank $3$ real cluster-cyclic exchange matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sign-coherence about $c$-vectors was conjectured by Fomin-Zelevinsky and solved completely by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich for integer skew-symmetrizable case. We prove this conjecture associated with $c$-vectors for rank 3 real cluster-cyclic skew-symmetrizable case. Simultaneously, we establish their self-contained recursion and monotonicity. Then, these $c$-vectors are proved to be roots of certain quadratic equations. Based on these results, we prove that the corresponding exchange graphs of $C$-pattern and $G$-pattern are $3$-regular trees. We also study the structure of tropical signs and equip the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_6$ with a cluster realization via certain mutations.</description>

      <title>Black-White Cell Capacity in $k$-ary Words and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new bargraph statistic that we call black-white cell capacity. It is obtained by coloring the cells of the bargraph in a chessboard style and recording the numbers of black and white cells contained in the bargraph. We study two word families under this statistic: $k$-ary words and permutations. We obtain the corresponding generating function, in the $k$-ary words case, and a closed-form formula for each $n$, in the permutations case. Of special interest are words containing an equal number of black and white cells, that we call bw-balanced. We obtain generating functions, closed-form formulas, and asymptotics in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every natural number $p$, we show that the maximum negative girth among the class of signed graphs on $n$ vertices with balanced chromatic number at least $p$ is between $(1/e)n^{1/(p-1)}$ and $2(p-1) n^{1/(p-1)}$. This extends a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai to signed graphs.</description>

      <title>New constructions and bounds for nonabelian Sidon sets with applications to Tur\'an-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $S_k$-set in a group $\Gamma$ is a set $A\subseteq\Gamma$ such that $\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_k=\beta_1\cdots\beta_k$ with $\alpha_i,\beta_i\in A$ implies $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k)=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_k)$. An $S_k'$-set is a set such that $\alpha_1\beta_1^{-1}\cdots\alpha_k\beta_k^{-1}=1$ implies that there exists $i$ such that $\alpha_i=\beta_i\text{ or }\beta_i=\alpha_{i+1}$. We give explicit constructions of large $S_k$-sets in the group $S_n$ and $S_2$-sets in $S_n\times S_n$ and $A_n\times A_n$. We give probabilistic constructions for `nice' groups which obtain large $S_2$-sets in $A_n$ and $S_2'$-sets in $S_n$. We also give upper bounds on the size of $S_k$-sets in certain groups, improving the trivial bound by a constant multiplicative factor. We describe some connections between $S_k$-sets and extremal graph theory. In particular, we determine up to a constant factor the minimum outdegree of a digraph which guarantees even cycles with certain orientations. As applications, we improve the upper bound on Hamilton paths which pairwise create a two-part cycle of given length, and we show that a directed version of the Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits compactness conjecture is false.</description>

      <title>A directed Andr\'asfai-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os theorem and chromatic profiles of oriented cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic profile of a digraph $H$, denoted by $\delta_{\chi}^{+}(H,k)$, is the infimum $d$ such that any $H$-free digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices with minimum out-degree $\delta^{+}(D) \ge dn$ must be $k$-colorable. We determine the exact chromatic profile for several fundamental classes of digraphs. Our main result is a directed analogue of the Andr\'asfai-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os theorem, stating that $\delta_\chi^{+}(T_r, r-1)=\frac{3 r-7}{3 r-4}$, where $T_r$ is the transitive tournament on $r$ vertices. We then determine the chromatic profile for directed odd cycles, showing that $\delta^+_\chi(\overrightarrow{C}_{2\ell+1},2)=1/2$ for all $\ell\ge 1$. Finally, we resolve the profile for the three remaining orientations of the pentagon, establishing that $\delta_{\chi}^{+}(C_{5}',2)=\delta_{\chi}^{+}(C_{5}'',2)=\delta_{\chi}^{+}(C_{5}''',2)=1/3$.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Zero Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process studied for its wide array of applications. In this process the vertices of the graph are initially designated as filled or unfilled, and a zero forcing set is a set of initially filled vertices that results in all vertices filled after repeated application of a color change rule. The zero forcing number of a graph is the minimum cardinality of a zero forcing set. The zero forcing number has motivated the introduction of a host of variants defined by linear-algebraic or graph-theoretic contexts. We define a variant we term the $k$-fault tolerant zero forcing number, which is the minimum cardinality of a set $B$ such that every subset of $B$ of cardinality $|B|-k$ is a zero forcing set. We study the values of this parameter on various graph families, the behavior under various graph operations, and the number of iterations of the color change rule necessary to fill all vertices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</description>

      <title>On the Independence Numbers of the Cyclic Van der Waerden Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Berglund (2018), we establish a method for constructing subsets $B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ such that $B$ does not contain any $k$-term cyclic arithmetic progressions mod $mk$, where $m,k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ with $k \geq 3$. This construction thereby provides concrete lower bounds for the maximum size of such subsets. Additionally, it allows us to tightly bound specific chromatic numbers $\chi(mk,k)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ and helps increase the lower bounds of certain cyclic Van der Waerden numbers $W_{c}(k,r)$, originally introduced by Burkert and Johnson (2011) as a way of bounding the standard Van der Waerden numbers $W(k,r)$ from below for $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $n$-vertex tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)\le cn$ has Ramsey number $R(T)=\max\{t_1+2t_2,2t_1\}-1$, where $t_1\ge t_2$ are the sizes of the bipartition classes of $T$. This improves an asymptotic result of Haxell, {\L}uczak, and Tingley from 2002, and shows that, though Burr's 1974 conjecture on the Ramsey numbers of trees has long been known to be false for certain `double stars', it is true for trees with up to small linear maximum degree.</description>

      <title>How to find all extremal graphs using symmetric subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of graphs with $\min_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\chi(F)=r+1\geq3$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. Set $t=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|$. Let ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with maximum edges among all the graphs of order $n$ without any $F\in\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Let $T(n,r)$ be the Tur\'{a}n graph of order $n$ with $r$ parts. Assume that some $F_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$ is a subgraph of the graph obtained from $T(rt,r)$ by embedding a path in its one part. Simonovits \cite{S1} introduced the concept of symmetric subgraphs, and proved that there exist graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ which have symmetrical property. In this paper, we aim to find a way to characterize all the extremal graphs for such $\mathcal{F}$ using symmetric subgraphs. Some new extremal results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Zero-Freeness is All You Need: A Weitz-Type FPTAS for the Entire Lee-Yang Zero-Free Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the entire Lee-Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal probability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we indeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We prove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold quite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models. Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new SSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM can be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for Weitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property independent of zero-freeness.</description>

      <title>Symplectic configurations: a homological and computer-aided approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.</description>

Abstract: Positroid subvarieties of complex Grassmannians are the images of the Richardson subvarieties of the full flag varieties under the natural projection map. Positroid varieties admit natural embedding into certain quiver Grassmannians for equioriented cyclic quivers. Varying representations of the quiver, one defines global positroid varieties inside the type A global affine Grassmannian. General fiber of a family is isomorphic to the corresponding classical positroid variety and the special fiber is a subvariety of the juggling variety. We show that the global positroid families are flat and describe their (conjecturally reduced) scheme structures. We also describe the special fibers inside the product of classical positroid varieties and realize the irreducible components of the special fibers in terms of the affine Richardson varieties.</description>

      <title>Permuton and local limits for the Luce model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of permutations drawn from the Luce model, a natural probabilistic framework in which permutations are generated sequentially by sampling without replacement, with selection probabilities proportional to prescribed positive weights. These permutations arise in applications such as ranking models, the Tsetlin library, and related Markov processes. Under minimal assumptions on the weights, we establish a permuton limit theorem describing the global behavior of Luce-distributed permutations and derive an explicit density of the limiting permuton. We further compute limiting pattern densities and analyze the differences between exact Luce permutations and their permuton approximations. We also study the local convergence of these permutations, proving a quenched Benjamini--Schramm limit and a central limit theorem for consecutive pattern occurrences. Finally, we prove a central limit theorem for the number of inversions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positroids are families of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. In particular, positroids enumerate a CW decomposition of the totally non-negative Grassmannian. Furthermore, Postnikov has identified several families of combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids. We will provide yet another characterization of positroids for Gr$_{\geq 0}(2,n)$, the Grassmannians of lines, in terms of certain graphs. We use this characterization to compute the dimension and the boundary of positroid cells. This also leads to a combinatorial description of the intersection of positroid cells, that is easily computable. Our techniques rely on determining different ways to enlarge a given collection of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ to represent the dependent sets of a positroid, that is the dependencies among the columns of a matrix with non-negative maximal minors. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to compute all the maximal positroids contained in a set.</description>

      <title>The Orbit-Sum Method for Higher Order Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbit-sum method is an algebraic version of the reflection-principle that was introduced by Bousquet-M\'{e}lou and Mishna to solve functional equations that arise in the enumeration of lattice walks with small steps restricted to $\mathbb{N}^2$. It proceeds by computing a set of algebraic substitutions that can be applied to a given functional equation, forming a linear combination of its transformed versions to the end of eliminating some of the unknowns, and eliminating further unknowns by discarding terms with negative powers. The extension of the orbit-sum method to walks with large steps was started by Bostan, Bousquet-M\'{e}lou and Melczer. They presented an algorithm that computes the minimal polynomials of the algebraic substitutions. We continue their work by explaining, among other things, how to perform computations in their splitting field on the level of ``formal'' algebraic extensions and how its elements can be interpreted as series. We thereby make use of the primitive element theorem, Gr\"{o}bner bases and the shape lemma, and the Newton-Puiseux algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intersection patterns, incidence theorems, and distance problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sets in a finite vector space. In this paper, we study the magnitude of the set $A\cap f(B)$, where $f$ runs through a set of transformations. More precisely, we will focus on the cases that the set of transformations is given by orthogonal matrices or orthogonal projections. One of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A, B\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ satisfy some natural conditions, then, for almost every $g\in O(d)$, there are at least $\gg q^d$ elements $z\in \mathbb{F}_q^d$ such that \[|A\cap (g(B)+z)| \sim \frac{|A||B|}{q^d}.\] This implies that $|A-gB|\gg q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with $|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as $0&lt;x\le y&lt;2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find $\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)&gt;0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove these results, we need to develop new and robust incidence bounds between points and rigid motions by using a number of techniques including algebraic methods and discrete Fourier analysis. Our results are essentially sharp in odd dimensions. In the prime field plane, we further employ recent $L^2$ distance bounds and point-line/plane incidence machinery to derive improvements. Notable applications include a strong prime field analogue of a question of Mattila related to the Falconer distance problem, the Rotational Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem, and a quadratic expansion law. Taken together, the results in this paper present a robust two-way link between intersection phenomena and distance problems over finite fields, with dimension-uniform consequences and sharpness in several ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kneser signed graph $\KS(n,k)$, $k\leq n$, is the graph whose vertices are signed $k$-subsets of $[n]$ (i.e. $k$-subsets $S$ of $\{ \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \pm n\}$ such that $S\cap (-S)=\emptyset$). Two vertices $A$ and $B$ are adjacent with a positive edge if $A\cap (-B)=\emptyset$ and with a negative edge if $A\cap B=\emptyset$. We prove that the balanced chromatic number of $\KS(n,k)$ is $n-k+1$. We then introduce the signed analogue of Schrijver graphs and show that they form vertex-critical subgraphs of $\KS(n,k)$ with respect to balanced colouring. Further connection to topological methods, in particular, connection to Borsuk signed graphs is also considered.</description>

Abstract: Local face modules are modules over face rings whose Hilbert function is the local $h$-vector of a triangulation of a simplex. We study when Lefschetz properties hold for local face modules. We prove new inequalities for local $h$-vectors of vertex-induced triangulations by proving Lefschetz properties for local face modules of these triangulations. We show that, even for regular triangulations, Lefschetz properties can fail for local face modules in positive characteristic.</description>

If every vertex has an equal number of neighbors of each color, then the coloring is a $(2k+1)$-neighborhood balanced coloring. We establish a number of results for common families of graphs and present some families of graphs that have this property.</description>

      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we exploit a new technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' in designing rounding algorithms. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancies across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancies at any point during the process. This new technique is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The row-strict 0-Hecke action on standard immaculate skew tableaux was studied by the present authors, who showed that it gives rise to a bounded poset, called the \emph{skew immaculate Hecke poset}, and consequently to a cyclic 0-Hecke module. It was further shown that the subposet of skew standard extended immaculate tableaux always has a unique maximal element, but may have multiple minimal elements. In this paper we focus on these minimal elements, completely classifying them for a family of skew shapes that we call \emph{lobsters}. Moreover, we prove that when the skew shape is connected, the skew extended Hecke poset does have a unique minimal element, thereby showing that the associated 0-Hecke module is cyclic for both the row-strict and the dual immaculate actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic probabilistic phenomena arising from the application of the Schensted row insertion algorithm, a key component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence, to random inputs. Our analysis centers on a random tableau $T$ with a given shape $\lambda$, which may itself be random or deterministic. We examine the stochastic properties of the position of the new box created when inserting a deterministic entry into $T$. Specifically, we focus on the fluctuations of this position around its expected value as the size of the Young diagram $\lambda$ approaches infinity. Our findings reveal that these fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian, with the mean and variance expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram $\lambda$. An important application of this analysis is the RSK algorithm applied to a finite, long sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. While there remains a gap in the reasoning for this case, we present an explicit conjecture regarding its behavior.</description>

      <title>Maximally-stable Local Optima in Random Graphs and Spin Glasses: Phase Transitions and Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $h$-stable local optima of Ising spin glass models, defined as spin configurations such that for nearly all of the spins, flipping their values results in increasing energy by at least a given amount $h$. Spins satisfying this condition are referred to as $h$-stable spins for that configuration. Similarly, we consider a very related notion of $h$-friendly partitions of a graph. These are defined as bi-partitionings such that for most nodes, the normalized number of neighbors within the node's partition exceed the normalized number of neighbors outside the partition by a certain amount $h$. For spin glasses as well as sparse and dense random graphs, while restricting to bisections, we prove the existence of a phase transition for the normalized energy level $h$ around a universal value $h^*$. For $h$ below the phase transition value $h^*$, bisections exist where the number of spins (nodes) which are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is sublinear. Above the phase transition level $h^*$ the smallest number of spins that are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is linear. This confirms a conjecture from Behrens et al. (2022). Our results also allow the characterization of possible energy values of stable local optima for varying $h$. In particular, for $h=0$, this rigorously proves seminal results in statistical physics regarding the so-called metastable states, such as in the work of Bray and Moore (1981). Our results extend a recent proof of the so-called Friendly Partition Conjecture in Ferber et al. (2022) from the case $h=0$ to the case when $h$ takes general values. Our proofs are obtained by analyzing the model on sparse random graphs and adopting Lindeberg's type universality method to lift the results from sparse to dense graphs and spin systems.</description>

      <title>Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters.
  We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points.
  Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
  Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</description>

      <title>On the properties of alternating invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functions satisfying the functional equation \begin{align*} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \quad \text{for any positive odd integer $n$}, \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others.</description>

      <title>Frostman random variables, entropy inequalities, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent regimes. We prove that for any non-degenerate rational quadratic form $\phi(x, y)$ and parameter $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, there exists a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)$ such that \[ \max\{H_n(X+Y), H_n(\phi(X,Y))\} \geq n(s+\epsilon) \] for sufficiently large $n$, where the precise conditions on $(X,Y)$ depend on the Frostman level. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, and a dense subset $G\subset A\times A$, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\phi_G(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$, $\{A+_GA:=\{x+y\colon (x, y)\in G\}$, and $\phi_G(A):=\{\phi(x, y)\colon (x, y)\in G\}$.</description>

      <title>Surface sums in two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills: Cancellations and explicit computations for general loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model that admits many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process"), which, at each step, carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Constraints in Polyhedral Enclosure and Tetrahedral Decomposition in Genus-0 Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for determining whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>
