      <title>Ion-kinetic-energy sampling in a 22-pole trap using ring-electrode evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental method for the characterization of the kinetic energies of ions confined in a 22-pole radio frequency trap by inducing a small potential barrier using the surrounding ring electrodes, allowing the selective extraction of ions. Energy sampling experiments have been performed on buffer gas thermalized He$^+$ ions at trap temperatures between 10-180 K, resulting in distinct extraction curves as a function of the potential barrier, and a differentiated behavior depending on the escape time from the trap. The experiments are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations of the ion trajectories inside the calculated trap potential and allow us to investigate the properties of the sampling method, the role of ion motion coupling, and the impact of residual buffer gas collisions on the observed results. The technique has also been successfully applied to identify energetic H$_3^+$ ions produced in an exothermic reaction inside the trap. Upon calibration, this method can provide relative kinetic energy distributions or be used to filter the maximum desired kinetic energy of the ions inside the trap.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter study of two-axis Hanle magnetometry on the Cs D$_1$ line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied experimentally and theoretically the impact of various parameters on the characteristics of signals from a two-axis Hanle magnetometer based on the Cs D$_1$ transition illuminated by linearly polarized pump and probe beams propagating through the cell in such a way that the probe polarization vector can be switched between the $zy$- and the $xz$-plane in order to measure the magnetic field along the $x$- and $y$-axes, respectively. When the probe polarization additionally is reflected about the pump polarization vector and the two resulting absorption signals are subtracted, dispersion signals centered around zero are obtained. These dispersion signals can be reproduced accurately by the theoretical model, and the information from experiment and modeling used to optimize the magnetometer characteristics.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot etalon walk-off loss in ring cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabry-P\'erot etalons are widely used for laser frequency control. Inserting them in laser cavities imparts unavoidable walk-off loss and reduces the output power. Here, we treat the technology-relevant case of the walk-off loss of an etalon in a unidirectional ring cavity, which is a standard design of single-frequency lasers. We provide the theory background by discussing the analytic limits. The loss can be efficiently minimized by realignment, or by proper matching of the etalon's surface reflectivity with its refractive index. We numerically calculate the loss in the region uncovered by the analytic limits. We discuss practical laser design considerations, and we perform a tilt-tuning experiment in a single-frequency, solid-state laser setup.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Electric Resonance for Spatially-Resolved Spin Control via Pulsed Optical Excitation in the UV-Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear electric resonance (NER) spectroscopy is currently experiencing a revival as a tool for nuclear spin-based quantum computing. Compared to magnetic or electric fields, local electron density fluctuations caused by changes in the atomic environment provide a much higher spatial resolution for the addressing of nuclear spins in qubit registers or within a single molecule. In this article, we investigate the possibility of coherent spin control in atoms or molecules via nuclear quadrupole resonance from first principles. An abstract, time-dependent description is provided which entails and reflects on commonly applied approximations. This formalism is then used to propose a new method we refer to as `optical' nuclear electric resonance (ONER). It employs pulsed optical excitations in the UV-visible light spectrum to modulate the electric field gradient at the position of a specific nucleus of interest by periodic changes of the surrounding electron density. Possible realizations and limitations of ONER for atomically resolved spin manipulation are discussed and tested on $^9$Be as an atomic benchmark system via electronic structure theory.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>
