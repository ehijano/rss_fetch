      <title>Scaling of poroelastic coarsening and elastic arrest in crosslinked gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on crosslinked gels quenched from solvent-rich to solvent-poor conditions, show solvent-rich domains surrounded by gel-rich regions that coarsen followed by kinetic arrest at micron scales that persists for hours before full drainage to macroscopic equilibrium occurs on day timescales. Motivated by this, we present a general model for both coarsening and eventual arrest of pressure-driven coarsening in gels with solvent flow driven by interfacial tension of the solvent-rich domains and the gel. In gels in their viscoelastic time regime, this capillary force is dissipated by solvent transport through crosslinked polymers where the polymers develop transient elastic stresses due to solvent flow. At longer times, the long-ranged, elastic response of the gel provides a deterministic force which balances the capillary force thus arresting pressure-driven coarsening at a stiffness-dependent length. For a melt-like, polymer-rich gel, the coarsening length $\sim t^{1/4}$ where $t$ is the time, with an amplitude $ \sim G^{-1/2}$, where $G$ is the shear modulus. The arrest length in this regime also scales $\sim G^{-1/2}$. For low polymer fractions where the dominant length scale is the mesh size, the coarsening length can scale as $t^{1/3}$ varying with $G^{-1/3}$ (as does the arrest length). Our predictions for the arrest-length scaling with $\sim G^{-1/2}$ for the melt-like gel are consistent with the measurements.</description>

      <title>A parameterised equation of state, glass transition and jamming of the hard sphere system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gamma-distribution based potential energy landscape (PEL) theory has recently been proposed for supercooled liquids and glasses. This new PEL theory introduces a singularity term in the equation of state (EoS) suitable for representing the pressure of a glassy or jammed system. Using this framework, a parameterised EoS, Z(eta J), is developed with the random-jammed-packing fraction, eta J, as an input. This EoS is capable of accurately calculating the compressibility (pressure) across the entire metastable and glassy region from eta J=0.62 to 0.66, while seamlessly passing through the stable fluid region. Two special cases (paths) are examined in detail. The first path exhibits a singularity at the random close packing eta J=eta rcp=0.64, traversing the metastable region explored by most simulations. Various thermodynamic properties calculated are compared to simulation data, showing excellent agreements. The second case addresses the first analytical EoS for the ideal glass transition in the hard sphere system. Finally, the transport properties of the hard sphere fluid are modeled using the Arrhenius law and the excess entropy scaling law. It is found that both laws fail (with slope changing) at eta=0.555, where the heat capacity peaks and the contributions of inherent structures and jamming effects begin to emerge.</description>

      <title>Confinement and shear effects on the rotational diffusion of a minimal virus-inspired colloidal particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational diffusion of a rigid spherical body decorated with dimers in an explicit fluid environment is reported. This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called P\'eclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets.</description>

      <title>Modeling bacterial flow field with regularized singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow field generated by a swimming bacterium serves as a fundamental building block for understanding hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria. Although the flow field generated by a force dipole (stresslet) well captures the fluid motion in the far field limit, the stresslet description does not work in the near-field limit, which can be important in microswimmer interactions. Here we propose the model combining an anisotropically regularized stresslet with an isotropically regularized source dipole, and it nicely reproduces the flow field around a swimming bacterium, which is validated by the experimental measurements of the flow field around \textit{E. coli} and our boundary-element-method simulations of a helical microswimmer, in both cases of the free space and the confined space with a no-slip wall. This work provides a practical tool for obtaining the flow field of the bacterium, and can be utilised to study the collective responses of bacteria in dense suspensions.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints suppress shear localization in granular chain ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled granular systems exhibit mechanical rigidity and resistance to deformation, reminiscent of cohesive materials, due to their reduced degrees of freedom and contact friction. A quantitative understanding of how classical granular phenomena, such as shear localization and plastic flow, appear in such geometrically cohesive systems remains unknown. Here, we investigate this using granular chain ensembles subjected to direct shear tests. Our experiments reveal that chains longer than four beads exhibit pronounced shear hardening, which is nearly independent of the applied normal stress and is accompanied by the complete suppression of shear localization. The volume dilation of the long chain ensembles also does not vanish in the steady state. We complement this phenomenology, which is distinct from that of typical frictional granular ensembles, with DEM simulations. The simulations reveal that tensile forces are generated due to particles being locally jammed, characterized by a high non-covalent coordination number. Consequently, this leads to a deformation that shows a very diffuse region of localization and enhanced shear hardening. Overall, our study highlights that granular chains provide a systematic route to map how connectivity constraints impact flow properties and mechanical rigidity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bidirectional Coupling of Membrane Morphology and Rod Organization in Flexible Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ordering of rod-like particles in soft, deformable containers emerges from the interplay of anisotropic interactions, geometric confinement, and boundary compliance. This competition couples internal particle organization to container morphology and is central to biological processes such as cell motility, division, and encapsulation, in which cytoskeletal filaments confined by lipid membranes actively reshape cells. Using a minimal model combining experiments and simulations of colloidal rods encapsulated in lipid vesicles, we show that soft confinement drives a bidirectional coupling between internal order and vesicle shape. This interplay gives rise to a phase diagram in which elongated vesicles promote nematic alignment at lower packing fractions, whereas higher packing fractions induce smectic-like ordering that reshapes vesicles into plate-like morphologies with increased bending energy. Furthermore, by controlling vesicle volume and membrane area, we demonstrate that these boundary conditions enable reversible tuning of both vesicle shape and internal rod organization. This study establishes a promising route for dynamically controlling colloidal self-assembly in soft containers and for mimicking ordering in cell-like compartments.</description>

      <title>How Geometry Tames Disorder in Lattice Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fracture behavior of pre-cracked triangular beam-lattices whose elements have failure stresses drawn from a Weibull distribution. Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials.</description>

      <title>A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. In this paper, we show that a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.</description>

      <title>The chiral random walk: A quantum-inspired framework for odd diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality in active and passive fluids gives rise to odd transport properties, most notably the emergence of robust edge currents that defy standard dissipative dynamics. While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p&lt;1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media.</description>

      <title>Theory for enzymatic degradation of semi-crystalline polymer particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In enzymatic recycling or biodegradation of semi-crystalline plastic waste, crystalline spherulites embedded into an amorphous matrix hinder and slow down depolymerisation. When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze gravitaxis of a Brownian circle swimmer by deriving and characterizing analytically the experimentally measurable intermediate scattering function (ISF). To solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation we use a spectral-theory approach and find formal expressions in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the overdamped-noisy-driven-pendulum problem. We further perform a Taylor series of the ISF in the wavevector to read off the cumulants up to the fourth order. We focus on the skewness and kurtosis analyzed for four observation directions in the 2D-plane. Validating our findings involves conducting Langevin-dynamics simulations and interpreting the results using a harmonic approximation. The skewness and kurtosis are amplified as the orienting torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift of the circle swimmer from above, highlighting deviations from Gaussian behavior. Transforming the ISF to the comoving frame, again a measurable quantity, reveals gravitactic effects and diverse behaviors spanning from diffusive motion at low wavenumbers to circular motion at intermediate and directed motion at higher wavenumbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects in systems with liquid-crystalline order are crucial in determining their large-scale properties. In active systems, they are known to have properties impossible at equilibrium: for example, $+1/2$ defects in nematically-ordered systems self-propel. While some previous theoretical descriptions relied on assuming that the defect shape remains unperturbed by activity, we show that this assumption can lead to inconsistent predictions. We compute the shape of $-1/2$ defects and show that the one of $+1/2$ is intimately related to their self-propulsion speed. Our analytical predictions are corroborated via numerical simulations of a generic active nematic theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the translocation of a flexible polymer through extended
  patterned pores using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We
  consider cylindrical and conical pore geometries that can be
  controlled by the angle of the pore apex $\alpha$. We obtained the
  average translocation time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for various chain
  lengths $N$ and the length of the pores $L_p$ for various values
  $\alpha$ and found that $\langle \tau \rangle$ scales as $\langle
  \tau \rangle \sim N^\gamma \mathcal{F}\left( L_p N^\phi \right)$
  with exponents $\gamma = 3.00\pm0.05$ and $\phi = 1.50\pm0.05$ for
  both patterned and unpatterned pores.</description>

      <title>A flat-band perspective on the boson peak in amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boson peak is a characteristic anomaly of amorphous solids broadly defined as a low-energy excess in the density of states and heat capacity compared to the textbook predictions of Debye theory. The origin of this anomaly has long been the subject of ongoing debate and remains a topic of active controversy. We propose that the boson peak may have a defining dynamical feature: the accumulation of vibrational spectral weight within a narrow frequency window that is only weakly dependent on wavevector. In this perspective, the boson peak reflects a flat or weakly dispersive band in the dynamical structure factor rather than a propagating excitation. We revisit both experimental and simulation data from the literature through this lens and conduct further simulations in 2D and 3D amorphous systems. Taken together, these analyses provide compelling converging evidence for this interpretation and sharply constrain the space of viable theoretical descriptions of the boson peak.</description>

Abstract: Shear thickening suspensions of non-Brownian polydisperse particles are simulated in 2D using a discrete element method based algorithm (LF-DEM) at high packing fractions ($\phi$) and large non-dimensional stresses ($\sigma$). Rigidity analysis of the stress induced particle clusters is carried out using \textit{pebble game} algorithm for polydisperse suspensions and compared with the statistically equivalent bidisperse systems. A critical value of the packing fraction, $\phi_c$, close to the shear jamming transition, $\phi_J^{\mu}$, ($\phi_c&lt;\phi_J^{\mu}$) is obtained where rigid particle clusters begin to grow sharply. The growth is found to be characterized by a critical transition of an order parameter ($f_\text{rig}$), defined by the fraction of particles in rigid clusters which scales as, $f_\text{rig}\sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ for $\phi&gt;\phi_c$, and by the susceptibility scaling, $\chi_\text{rig}\sim|\phi-\phi_c |^{-\gamma}$, with exponents having values consistent with the critical exponents in 2D percolation transition. The variations of $f_\text{rig}$ and $\chi_\text{rig}$ in polydisperse suspensions are found to be identical to that of the statistically equivalent bidisperse suspensions. Finite size scaling analysis shows a divergence of correlation length near $\phi_{c_\infty}$ following critical exponent $\nu\approx 1.33$, in agreement with the 2D percolation theory. Furthermore, $\phi_c$ and $\phi_J^{\mu}$ are found to vary non-monotonically with polydispersity index and depend on the particle stiffness.</description>
