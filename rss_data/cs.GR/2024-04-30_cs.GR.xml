      <title>Differentiable Geodesic Distance for Intrinsic Minimization on Triangle Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing intrinsic distances on discrete surfaces is at the heart of many minimization problems in geometry processing and beyond. Solving these problems is extremely challenging as it demands the computation of on-surface distances along with their derivatives. We present a novel approach for intrinsic minimization of distance-based objectives defined on triangle meshes. Using a variational formulation of shortest-path geodesics, we compute first and second-order distance derivatives based on the implicit function theorem, thus opening the door to efficient Newton-type minimization solvers. We demonstrate our differentiable geodesic distance framework on a wide range of examples, including geodesic networks and membranes on surfaces of arbitrary genus, two-way coupling between hosting surface and embedded system, differentiable geodesic Voronoi diagrams, and efficient computation of Karcher means on complex shapes. Our analysis shows that second-order descent methods based on our differentiable geodesics outperform existing first-order and quasi-Newton methods by large margins.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Voronoi Diagrams for Simulation of Cell-Based Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating topological transitions in cellular mechanical systems is a significant challenge for existing simulation methods. While abstract models lack predictive capabilities at the cellular level, explicit network representations struggle with topology changes, and per-cell representations are computationally too demanding for large-scale simulations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cell-centered approach based on differentiable Voronoi diagrams. Representing each cell with a Voronoi site, our method defines shape and topology of the interface network implicitly. In this way, we substantially reduce the number of problem variables, eliminate the need for explicit contact handling, and ensure continuous geometry changes during topological transitions. Closed-form derivatives of network positions facilitate simulation with Newton-type methods for a wide range of per-cell energies. Finally, we extend our differentiable Voronoi diagrams to enable coupling with arbitrary rigid and deformable boundaries. We apply our approach to a diverse set of examples, highlighting splitting and merging of cells as well as neighborhood changes. We illustrate applications to inverse problems by matching soap foam simulations to real-world images. Comparative analysis with explicit cell models reveals that our method achieves qualitatively comparable results at significantly faster computation times.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap 3D Reconstructed Scenes from 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in neural rendering techniques have greatly enhanced the rendering of photo-realistic 3D scenes across both academic and commercial fields. The latest method, known as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), has set new benchmarks for rendering quality and speed. Nevertheless, the limitations of 3D-GS become pronounced in synthesizing new viewpoints, especially for views that greatly deviate from those seen during training. Additionally, issues such as dilation and aliasing arise when zooming in or out. These challenges can all be traced back to a single underlying issue: insufficient sampling. In our paper, we present a bootstrapping method that significantly addresses this problem. This approach employs a diffusion model to enhance the rendering of novel views using trained 3D-GS, thereby streamlining the training process. Our results indicate that bootstrapping effectively reduces artifacts, as well as clear enhancements on the evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show that our method is versatile and can be easily integrated, allowing various 3D reconstruction projects to benefit from our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientists often explore and analyze large-scale scientific simulation data by leveraging two- and three-dimensional visualizations. The data and tasks can be complex and therefore best supported using myriad display technologies, from mobile devices to large high-resolution display walls to virtual reality headsets. Using a simulation of neuron connections in the human brain, we present our work leveraging various web technologies to create a multi-platform scientific visualization application. Users can spread visualization and interaction across multiple devices to support flexible user interfaces and both co-located and remote collaboration. Drawing inspiration from responsive web design principles, this work demonstrates that a single codebase can be adapted to develop scientific visualization applications that operate everywhere.</description>

      <title>Neural Modes: Self-supervised Learning of Nonlinear Modal Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised approach for learning physics-based subspaces for real-time simulation. Existing learning-based methods construct subspaces by approximating pre-defined simulation data in a purely geometric way. However, this approach tends to produce high-energy configurations, leads to entangled latent space dimensions, and generalizes poorly beyond the training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach that directly minimizes the system's mechanical energy during training. We show that our method leads to learned subspaces that reflect physical equilibrium constraints, resolve overfitting issues of previous methods, and offer interpretable latent space parameters.</description>

      <title>BlenderAlchemy: Editing 3D Graphics with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphics design is important for various applications, including movie production and game design. To create a high-quality scene, designers usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes, hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs with "imagined" reference images from image-generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks such as editing procedural materials from text and/or reference images, as well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex scenes.</description>

      <title>High-quality Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Surfels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel point-based representation, Gaussian surfels, to combine the advantages of the flexible optimization procedure in 3D Gaussian points and the surface alignment property of surfels. This is achieved by directly setting the z-scale of 3D Gaussian points to 0, effectively flattening the original 3D ellipsoid into a 2D ellipse. Such a design provides clear guidance to the optimizer. By treating the local z-axis as the normal direction, it greatly improves optimization stability and surface alignment. While the derivatives to the local z-axis computed from the covariance matrix are zero in this setting, we design a self-supervised normal-depth consistency loss to remedy this issue. Monocular normal priors and foreground masks are incorporated to enhance the quality of the reconstruction, mitigating issues related to highlights and background. We propose a volumetric cutting method to aggregate the information of Gaussian surfels so as to remove erroneous points in depth maps generated by alpha blending. Finally, we apply screened Poisson reconstruction method to the fused depth maps to extract the surface mesh. Experimental results show that our method demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art neural volume rendering and point-based rendering methods.</description>

      <title>Processing HSV Colored Medical Images and Adapting Color Thresholds for Computational Image Analysis: a Practical Introduction to an open-source tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for computational medical image analysis has shown promising results. However, colored images are often not readily available for AI analysis because of different coloring thresholds used across centers and physicians as well as the removal of clinical annotations. We aimed to develop an open-source tool that can adapt different color thresholds of HSV-colored medical images and remove annotations with a simple click.
  Materials and Methods: We built a function using MATLAB and used multi-center international shear wave elastography data (NCT 02638935) to test the function. We provide step-by-step instructions with accompanying code lines.
  Results: We demonstrate that the newly developed pre-processing function successfully removed letters and adapted different color thresholds of HSV-colored medical images.
  Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for removing letters and adapting different color thresholds in HSV-colored medical images. We hope this contributes to advancing medical image processing for developing robust computational imaging algorithms using diverse multi-center big data. The open-source Matlab tool is available at https://github.com/cailiemed/image-threshold-adapting.</description>

      <title>Assessing Image Quality Using a Simple Generative Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) is the task of predicting the visual quality of an image as perceived by a human observer. Current state-of-the-art techniques are based on deep representations trained in discriminative manner. Such representations may ignore visually important features, if they are not predictive of class labels. Recent generative models successfully learn low-dimensional representations using auto-encoding and have been argued to preserve better visual features. Here we leverage existing auto-encoders and propose VAE-QA, a simple and efficient method for predicting image quality in the presence of a full-reference. We evaluate our approach on four standard benchmarks and find that it significantly improves generalization across datasets, has fewer trainable parameters, a smaller memory footprint and faster run time.</description>

      <title>3D Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods have achieved great success in the field of novel view synthesis. However, specular reflection remains non-trivial, as the high frequency radiance field is notoriously difficult to fit stably and accurately. We present a deferred shading method to effectively render specular reflection with Gaussian splatting. The key challenge comes from the environment map reflection model, which requires accurate surface normal while simultaneously bottlenecks normal estimation with discontinuous gradients. We leverage the per-pixel reflection gradients generated by deferred shading to bridge the optimization process of neighboring Gaussians, allowing nearly correct normal estimations to gradually propagate and eventually spread over all reflective objects. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and concurrent work in synthesizing high-quality specular reflection effects, demonstrating a consistent improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for both synthetic and real-world scenes, while running at a frame rate almost identical to vanilla Gaussian splatting.</description>

      <title>Anywhere: A Multi-Agent Framework for Reliable and Diverse Foreground-Conditioned Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image inpainting, particularly through diffusion modeling, have yielded promising outcomes. However, when tested in scenarios involving the completion of images based on the foreground objects, current methods that aim to inpaint an image in an end-to-end manner encounter challenges such as "over-imagination", inconsistency between foreground and background, and limited diversity. In response, we introduce Anywhere, a pioneering multi-agent framework designed to address these issues. Anywhere utilizes a sophisticated pipeline framework comprising various agents such as Visual Language Model (VLM), Large Language Model (LLM), and image generation models. This framework consists of three principal components: the prompt generation module, the image generation module, and the outcome analyzer. The prompt generation module conducts a semantic analysis of the input foreground image, leveraging VLM to predict relevant language descriptions and LLM to recommend optimal language prompts. In the image generation module, we employ a text-guided canny-to-image generation model to create a template image based on the edge map of the foreground image and language prompts, and an image refiner to produce the outcome by blending the input foreground and the template image. The outcome analyzer employs VLM to evaluate image content rationality, aesthetic score, and foreground-background relevance, triggering prompt and image regeneration as needed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Anywhere framework excels in foreground-conditioned image inpainting, mitigating "over-imagination", resolving foreground-background discrepancies, and enhancing diversity. It successfully elevates foreground-conditioned image inpainting to produce more reliable and diverse results.</description>

      <title>Stylus: Automatic Adapter Selection for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond scaling base models with more data or parameters, fine-tuned adapters provide an alternative way to generate high fidelity, custom images at reduced costs. As such, adapters have been widely adopted by open-source communities, accumulating a database of over 100K adapters-most of which are highly customized with insufficient descriptions. This paper explores the problem of matching the prompt to a set of relevant adapters, built on recent work that highlight the performance gains of composing adapters. We introduce Stylus, which efficiently selects and automatically composes task-specific adapters based on a prompt's keywords. Stylus outlines a three-stage approach that first summarizes adapters with improved descriptions and embeddings, retrieves relevant adapters, and then further assembles adapters based on prompts' keywords by checking how well they fit the prompt. To evaluate Stylus, we developed StylusDocs, a curated dataset featuring 75K adapters with pre-computed adapter embeddings. In our evaluation on popular Stable Diffusion checkpoints, Stylus achieves greater CLIP-FID Pareto efficiency and is twice as preferred, with humans and multimodal models as evaluators, over the base model.

      <title>Instant3D: Instant Text-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has attracted much attention from the computer vision community. Existing methods mainly optimize a neural field from scratch for each text prompt, relying on heavy and repetitive training cost which impedes their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation, dubbed Instant3D. Once trained, Instant3D is able to create a 3D object for an unseen text prompt in less than one second with a single run of a feedforward network. We achieve this remarkable speed by devising a new network that directly constructs a 3D triplane from a text prompt. The core innovation of our Instant3D lies in our exploration of strategies to effectively inject text conditions into the network. In particular, we propose to combine three key mechanisms: cross-attention, style injection, and token-to-plane transformation, which collectively ensure precise alignment of the output with the input text. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective activation function, the scaled-sigmoid, to replace the original sigmoid function, which speeds up the training convergence by more than ten times. Finally, to address the Janus (multi-head) problem in 3D generation, we propose an adaptive Perp-Neg algorithm that can dynamically adjust its concept negation scales according to the severity of the Janus problem during training, effectively reducing the multi-head effect. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving significantly better efficiency. The code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/ming1993li/Instant3DCodes.</description>

Abstract: Apparel's significant role in human appearance underscores the importance of garment digitalization for digital human creation. Recent advances in 3D content creation are pivotal for digital human creation. Nonetheless, garment generation from text guidance is still nascent. We introduce a text-driven 3D garment generation framework, DressCode, which aims to democratize design for novices and offer immense potential in fashion design, virtual try-on, and digital human creation. For our framework, we first introduce SewingGPT, a GPT-based architecture integrating cross-attention with text-conditioned embedding to generate sewing patterns with text guidance. We also tailored a pre-trained Stable Diffusion for high-quality, tile-based PBR texture generation. By leveraging a large language model, our framework generates CG-friendly garments through natural language interaction. Our method also facilitates pattern completion and texture editing, streamlining the design process through user-friendly interaction. This framework fosters innovation by allowing creators to freely experiment with designs and incorporate unique elements into their work, thereby igniting new ideas and artistic possibilities. With comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, our method showcases the best quality and alignment with input prompts. User studies further validate our high-quality rendering results, highlighting its practical utility and potential in production settings.

      <description>arXiv:2402.15340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic avatar is a modern term referring to the digital asset that represents a human in computer graphic advanced systems such as video games and simulation tools. These avatars utilize the advances in graphic technologies in both software and hardware aspects. While photo-realistic avatars are increasingly used in industrial simulations, representing human factors such as human workers psychophysiological states, remains a challenge. This article addresses this issue by introducing the concept of MetaStates which are the digitization and representation of the psychophysiological states of a human worker in the digital world. The MetaStates influence the physical representation and performance of a digital human worker while performing a task. To demonstrate this concept, this study presents the development of a photo-realistic avatar enhanced with multi-level graphical representations of psychophysiological states relevant to Industry 5.0. This approach represents a major step forward in the use of digital humans for industrial simulations, allowing companies to better leverage the benefits of the Industrial Metaverse in their daily operations and simulations while keeping human workers at the center of the system.</description>

Abstract: In driving tasks, the driver's situation awareness of the surrounding scenario is crucial for safety driving. However, current methods of measuring situation awareness mostly rely on subjective questionnaires, which interrupt tasks and lack non-intrusive quantification. To address this issue, our study utilizes objective gaze motion data to provide an interference-free quantification method for situation awareness. Three quantitative scores are proposed to represent three different levels of awareness: perception, comprehension, and projection, and an overall score of situation awareness is also proposed based on above three scores. To validate our findings, we conducted experiments where subjects performed driving tasks in a virtual reality simulated environment. All the four proposed situation awareness scores have clearly shown a significant correlation with driving performance. The proposed not only illuminates a new path for understanding and evaluating the situation awareness but also offers a satisfying proxy for driving performance.</description>
