      <title>Intermediate-temperature topological Uhlmann phase on IBM quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin-1 system can exhibit an intermediate-temperature topological regime with a quantized Uhlmann phase sandwiched by topologically trivial low- and high-temperature regimes. We present a quantum circuit consisting of system and ancilla qubits plus a probe qubit which prepares an initial state corresponding to the purified state of a spin-1 system at finite temperature, evolves the system according to the Uhlmann process, and measures the Uhlmann phase via expectation values of the probe qubit. Although classical simulations suggest the quantized Uhlmann phase is observable on IBM's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, an implementation of the circuit without any optimization exceeds the gate count for the error budget and results in unresolved signals. Through a series of optimization with Qiskit and BQSQit, the gate count can be substantially reduced, making the jumps of the Uhlmann phase more visible. A recent hardware upgrade of IBM quantum computers further improves the signals and leads to a clearer demonstration of interesting finite-temperature topological phenomena on NISQ hardware.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Reflectionless Mode Exceptional Degeneracies via Emergent Local Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of physically realizable exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) corresponding to synthetic reflectionless modes (SRM). These are solutions of an auxiliary wave operator that is defined in synthetic frequency dimensions and describe incoming reflectionless waves onto a Floquet-driven cavity. The SRM-EPD emerges as a consequence of a spontaneous local PT-symmetry imposed on the auxiliary operator via appropriate Floquet driving. Its presence signifies the possibility to design wavefronts and time-modulated schemes with up/down targeted frequency conversion and flat transmission spectra. The theory is validated via simulations with driven RF resonators.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.</description>
