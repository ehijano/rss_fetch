      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterotic String with the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of an axion-like particle above the QCD line would rule out Grand Unified Theories, including the perturbative heterotic string with the Standard Model embedded in a single $E_8$ factor or $SO(32)$. In this work we study a possible loophole to this observation, given by compactifications of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string with a non-standard embedding of the Standard Model into the 10-dimensional gauge group. If electromagnetism is embedded into both $E_8$ factors, axions can couple to photons via the anomaly without coupling to QCD. We obtain upper bounds to the coupling-to-mass ratio $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ for these axion-like particles as a function of the supersymmetry breaking scale and the unified gauge coupling. To be compatible with the measured gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_w$ at low-energies, phenomenologically viable models with non-standard $U(1)_Y$ embedding require sizeable one-loop threshold corrections from string states and/or charged matter at intermediate energy scales. We study how these effects modify the tree-level upper bounds to $g_{a\gamma}/m_a$ and show that, in the perturbative regime, they reduce the leading order estimates. Axion-like particles far above the QCD line are only possible in certain models where perturbation theory is lost. The main conclusion is that the discovery of an axion violating the bounds found in this work would be incompatible with large classes of otherwise phenomenologically viable string models, including the perturbative heterotic $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ string, the type-I string, and certain heterotic M-theories. The role of small gauge instantons and worldsheet instantons in making some of the axion-like particles heavy and cosmologically relevant is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Near-AdS$_2$ Backreaction on Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify how the two-point function of a real scalar field is affected by the distortion caused by deforming AdS$_2$ to a near-AdS$_2$ background. At tree-level, the backreaction of the geometry induces a finite-temperature correction to the correlator that arises from interactions that the background generates. For a massive field, we show that this correction is not captured by JT gravity coupled to matter: it requires a backreaction of the metric field. For a massless field, the correction is controlled solely by the dilaton and hence is model-independent. We compare our findings with correlation functions on BTZ and find perfect agreement. We use our results to quantify the corrections for a class of correlators relevant to five- and four-dimensional black holes. We discuss how these corrections would enter in a holographic description of near-AdS$_2$; we also comment on how these corrections provide a universal prediction for quasinormal modes in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the evaporation of saturated solitons and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested some time ago that many black hole properties are not specific to gravity, but rather are shared by a large class of objects, the so-called saturons, that saturate the quantum field theoretic upper bound on microstate degeneracy. By now, various aspects of this universality have been understood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present paper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a simple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black hole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the evaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously broken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay rate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by the inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking evaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also matches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the semiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum resolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal nature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous quantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons.</description>

      <title>(A)Symmetric Complexity and the Quantum Mpemba Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) -- the counter-intuitive phenomenon where states further from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it -- challenges standard expectations of quantum thermalization. In this work, we introduce Krylov complexity as a sensitive diagnostic for the QME. We show that Krylov spread complexity encodes the asymmetry essential to the effect, and we define a new class of projective (a)symmetric complexities that sharpen this connection. Strikingly, the structure of these projective complexities at the initial moment ($t=0$) already carries predictive power for the onset of Mpemba-like inversions, obviating the need for explicit time evolution. Our results suggest that the geometry of states in Krylov space captures deep information about non-monotonic relaxation and provides a powerful framework for diagnosing and anticipating anomalous thermalization phenomena in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Disordered Charged Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Entanglement Signal from Multipartite Entanglement of Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a signal $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ for genuine tripartite entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum systems and $\Delta^{(3)}_w$ for holographic systems. We prove that $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ is non-negative for any tripartite entangled mixed states. Based on the conjecture, the equality between an entanglement wedge cross section $E_w$ and entanglement of purification $E_p$, i.e., $E_w = E_P$ in the semiclassical limit, we apply the tripartite entanglement measure to study the structures of tripartite entanglement in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, especially for pure AdS$_3$. We comment on a generalization to $n$-partite entanglement signals $\Delta^{(n)}_p(A_1:\cdots:A_n)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational constant as a conserved charge in black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that coupling constants in a given action can be promoted to the role of conserved charges. This is achieved by introducing pairs of field variables constructed from combinations of scalar and gauge fields. This framework naturally suggests that the gravitational constant itself can be interpreted as a conserved charge, arising from an associated gauge symmetry. In a modified four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action, we explicitly show that the gravitational constant, in addition to the mass and the cosmological constant, emerges as a conserved charge. Our derivation, which employs the quasi-local off-shell ADT formalism, yields a result that is fully consistent with the extended thermodynamic first law and the Smarr formula.</description>

      <title>The gyromagnetic factor of charged rotating black holes in various dimensions from scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical black hole spacetimes can be recovered from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes in a low-energy effective field theory of gravity. In this work we compute, at first post-Minkowskian and dipole order, the metric and the electromagnetic potential for charged and rotating black holes in general spacetime dimensions from amplitudes describing the emission of either a graviton or a photon from a massive and charged Dirac fermion field up to one loop. In addition, we introduce a Pauli non-minimal coupling, to parametrize the black hole's gyromagnetic factor $\mathfrak{g}$. We are able to reproduce the Kerr-Newman solution in four dimensions, as well as the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution, from five-dimensional supergravity, which includes a Chern-Simons interaction. Crucially, we show that for a charged Myers-Perry like black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, its gyromagnetic factor is equal to $\mathfrak{g}=(d-1)/(d-2)$. Hence, only in $3+1$ dimensions minimal coupling is sufficient to describe black holes from scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Pauli blocking in near-extremal charged Nariai black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the Dirac equation for a massive charged fermion in the near-extremal charged Nariai black hole with the near-horizon geometry $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. At the one-loop level, contrary to the catastrophic emission of charged spinless bosons in [C.-M. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. D 110, 085020 (2024)], we show that the emission of fermions in a narrow time-like inner region between the cosmological horizon and black hole horizon saturates the bound from the Pauli blocking and does not give an amplification (quantum superradiance). Using the reciprocal relation, we find the Schwinger emission of fermions from $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$, and compare the Schwinger emission of fermions and bosons from near-extremal Nariai black holes.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We construct symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) using the sandwich construction of Pulmann-\v{S}evera-Valach that manifest the centre symmetries of Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory as well as general relativity in the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation. The 'filling' of the sandwich is an AKSZ sigma model whose target space is a Weil algebra, augmented with discrete degrees of freedom given by a choice of topological boundary condition.</description>

This black-hole is found to be an extension of the Clifton-Barrow metric for the specific case that $\delta=-1/2$. We look at physical properties such as test particle orbits, thermodynamics, and various space-time limits. In addition, we show an Eguchi-Hanson type-II $f(R)$ solution related to the found Taub-NUT framework.</description>

      <title>Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining Effective Field Theories for dark matter candidates annihilating into gamma-ray lines with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray lines constitute a smoking gun signature for annihilating dark matter particles. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes and satellites have searched for such signals but null results have been reported thus far. We take advantage of the expected gamma-ray flux sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) toward the direction of the Galactic Centre and Dwarf Galaxies and its exquisite energy resolution to derive upper limits on fermionic and scalar dark matter annihilations into gamma-ray lines. We consider the lowest-order effective operators for scalar and fermion dark matter, and derive limits on the energy scale using the recent CTAO projected sensitivity. Putting our findings into perspective with existing limits from direct and indirect detection experiments, we conclude that CTAO will either play a complementary role or be a discovery channel for dark matter signals.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity of topological phases. Or lack thereof</title>

Abstract: Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Diagnostics for Complex Langevin Simulations: The Role of Configurational Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) is a promising approach to tackle the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions. However, it can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable, thus underscoring the need for robust diagnostics. Existing criteria, such as monitoring the drift distribution or the Langevin-time operator, are valuable, but they remain indirect. In this work, we propose a complementary reliability test based on the configurational temperature. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the complex action. Unlike drift-based checks, this estimator directly probes thermodynamic consistency and thus offers a physically interpretable cross-check of CLM dynamics. To demonstrate that the estimator reproduces the input temperature with high precision, we use one-dimensional PT-symmetric models as a controlled benchmark. We show that the estimator also sensitively detects algorithmic errors, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization. While tested in low-dimensional systems, the method is readily extensible to higher-dimensional scalar and gauge theories, where scalable approximations make its implementation practical. Since temperature is tied to the bare coupling in many lattice theories, configurational monitoring can also serve as an independent check on coupling-dependent observables. Our results suggest that configurational temperature can be integrated into a hybrid diagnostic framework, thus enhancing the robustness of CLM across a wide range of applications, including future studies of lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Multigraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in background-independent quantum gravity, we discuss the quantization of labeled and unlabeled finite multigraphs with a maximum edge count. We provide a unified way to represent quantum multigraphs with labeled or unlabeled vertices, which enables the study of quantum multigraphs as dynamical microscopic degrees of freedom and not just as representations of relations among quantum states of particles. The quantum multigraphs represent a quantum mechanical treatment of the relations themselves and give rise to Hilbert space realizations of relations. After defining the Hilbert space, we focus on quantum simple graphs and explore the thermodynamics resulting from two simple models, a free Hamiltonian and an Ising-type Hamiltonian (with interactions among nearest-neighbor edges). We show that removing the distinction among vertices by considering unlabeled vertices gives rise to a qualitatively different thermodynamics. We find that the free theory of labeled quantum simple graphs is the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi--Gilbert $G(N,p)$ model of random graphs. This model has analytic free energy and hence no thermodynamic phase transition. On the other hand, the unlabeled quantum graphs give rise to proper thermodynamic phase transitions in both the free and the ferromagnetic Ising models, characterized by divergence in the specific heat and critical slowing near the critical temperature. The thermodynamic phase transition has an order parameter given as the fraction of vertices in the largest connected component. Although this is similar to the phase transition in the $G(N,p)$ model, in this case it represents the actual thermodynamic phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-review paper studies the null geodesics which appear for black hole solutions in the gravitational $4d$ model with anisotropic fluid. The equations of state for the fluid and solutions itselves depend upon integer parameter $q = 1, 2, ...$: $p_r = -\rho c^2 (2q-1)^{-1}, \quad p_t = - p_r$, where $\rho$ is the mass density, $c$ is speed of light, $p_r$ and $p_t$ are pressures in radial and transverse to radial directions, respectively. The circular null geodesics are explored and the master equation for radius $r_*$ of photon sphere is outlined as well as the proposition on existence and uniqueness of the solution to master equation obeying $r_* &gt; r_h$, where $r_h$ is horizon radius. The relations for spectrum of quasinormal modes for a test massless scalar field in the eikonal approximation are overviewed and compared with cyclic frequencies of circular null geodesics. The shadow angles are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions - are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Scalarization of Bardeen spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scalarization of the entire Bardeen spacetime which is constructed from a nonlinear magnetic monopole. We find that once the scalarization coupling parameter exceeds the scalarized threshold $a_t$, a scalarized Bardeen spacetime (SBS) solution exists for any magnetic charge $q$. However, the nature of the scalarization depends on the magnetic charge $q$. For $q$ less than a critical vaule $q_c$, when $a$ exceeds $a_t$, the scalar field emerges. As $a$ approaches $a_t$ from above (i.e., $a\to a_t^+$), the scalar field vanishes and the metric is reduced to a pure Bardeen spacetime. This behavior indicates that the solution exhibits the general ``spontaneous" scalarization phenomenon. Conversely, for $q \geq q_c$, in the limit $a \to a_t^+$, the scalar field is non-vanishing and the SBS approaches a ``frozen" SBS. Considering the importance of photon orbits in astronomical observations, we analyze the trajectories of photons around SBSs by analyzing null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Gravity from equilibrium thermodynamics of stretched light cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.</description>

      <title>Eikonal quasinormal modes of highly-spinning black holes in higher-curvature gravity: a window into extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.</description>

Abstract: In superconductivity, the Cooper pair \cite{Ref1} is a bound state of a pair of weakly interacting electrons in a metal which forces us to insert a factor of $2e$ (instead of $e$) in the phase of the wave function in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We claim that the existence of such a factor is universal. In \cite{Ref2}, we proposed an explanation for the AB effect (or equivalently, a supersymmetric Dirac monopole) based on SUSY. It is shown that this model opens a path to recapture this factor without the need for arguments related to attractive pairs. The idea is also applied to the case of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) when it is coupled to $\mathcal{N}=1$, supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Jain:2023fxc} the authors have proposed an interesting framework for studying holography in flat space-time. In this note we explore the relationship between their proposal and the Celestial Holography. In particular, we find that in both the massive and in the massless cases the asymptotic boundary limit of the bulk time-ordered Green's function $G$ is related to the Celestial amplitudes by an integral transformation. In the massless case the integral transformation reduces to the well known \textit{shadow transformation} of the celestial amplitude. Now the relation between the asymptotic limit of $G$ and the celestial amplitudes suggests that in asymptotically flat space-time if the scattering states are described by the conformal primary basis then the boundary operators defined by the extrapolate dictionary of \cite{Jain:2023fxc} are given by the \underline{shadow transformation} of the conformal primary operators living on the celestial sphere. This result refers to the non-contact part of the extrapolated Green's function. There are important contact term contributions which we also discuss in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our recently identified dynamical edge mode boundary condition to $p$-form gauge theories, revealing their edge modes as Goldstone bosons arising from gauge transformations with support on the boundary. The symplectic conjugates of these edge modes correspond to the electric-field-like components normal to the boundary. We demonstrate that both the symplectic form and the Hamiltonian naturally decompose into bulk and edge parts. When the boundary is a stretched horizon, we show that the thermal edge partition function reduces to that of a codimension-two ghost $(p-1)$-form residing on the bifurcation surface. These findings provide a dynamical framework that elucidates observations made by several authors. Additionally, we generalize Donnelly and Wall's non-dynamical approach to obtain edge partition functions for both massive and massless $p$-forms. In the context of a de Sitter static patch, these results are consistent with the edge partition functions found by several authors in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter space. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubble-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Interfaces in Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of non-local operators in gauge theory and holography, such as line-operators or interfaces, has attracted significant attention. Two-dimensional symmetric product orbifolds are close cousins of higher-dimensional gauge theory. In this work, we construct a novel family of interfaces in symmetric product orbifolds. These may be regarded as two-dimensional analogues of Wilson-line operators or Karch-Randall interfaces at the same time. The construction of the interfaces entails the choice of boundary conditions of the seed theory. For a generic seed theory, we construct the boundary states associated to the interfaces via the folding trick, compute their overlaps and extract the spectrum of interface changing operators through modular transformation. Then, we specialise to the supersymmetric four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ and show that the corresponding interfaces of the symmetric product orbifold are dual to $AdS_2$ branes in the tensionless limit of type IIB superstring theory on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$.</description>

      <title>Constructive approach to solution of the conservation condition for conformal higher spin tree-point correlation function with equal spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new constructive approach to the solutions of the conservation condition for the three-point conformal correlation function in the Osborn-Petkou formulation generalized by the authors for higher spins. We propose for correlation functions of the same spin conformal currents the general hypothesis that the Osborn-Petkou structural tensor of higher spins satisfying the right symmetry conditions can be obtained from the combination of the principal terms of spin one and two structural tensors raised to the degree corresponding to the value of spin s. We verified this hypothesis for the case of spin three and four and showed that the construction of the conserved three-point function can be reduced to the algebraic task of canceling the right hand sides of the divergences of constructed terms. Moreover it follows from this consideration that for spin three and four cases our solutions can be interpreted as the $CFT$-dual to the cubic interaction in the AdS space with one dimension more.</description>

      <title>The Phases of Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel physical picture to understand certain universal properties of the GUE matrix model which are typically ascribed to quantum chaos, i.e. the ramp and the plateau. We argue that these features should instead be associated with a pattern of spontaneous (or weak explicit) symmetry breaking. In this language, the GUE matrix model corresponds to an effective theory that describes the symmetry-broken phase, and where the Hermitian matrix of the GUE should be understood as a massive $\sigma$ field. The physics of this symmetry-broken phase governs certain particular features of the ramp such as its length and shape. However, the simple existence of a ramp is more universal and phase independent; it is related to sum rules obeyed by a large class of matrix models that constrain the interpolation to the plateau regime. Finally, the plateau is controlled by the symmetry-restored phase, which we call confined chaos.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Flat 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Black Hole with R\'enyi Entropy: An RPST-like formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity using R\'enyi entropy as a non-extensive generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The resulting thermodynamic structure, formulated within a restricted phase space-like (RPST-like) framework, reveals a striking resemblance to the thermodynamics of AdS black holes in the standard RPST formalism. In particular, we identify a thermodynamic duality between the R\'enyi deformation parameter $\beta$ and a conjugate response potential $\zeta$, analogous to the central charge and chemical potential in holographic theories. An extensive thermodynamic analysis in both fixed charge-$(\tilde{Q})$ and fixed potential-$(\tilde{\Phi})$ ensembles reveal Van der Waals-like first-order phase transitions which is an unexpected feature for asymptotically flat black holes. Furthermore, through the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD) and thermodynamic topology, It is shown that the R\'enyi modified flat black hole mimics, in both its thermodynamic topology and geometry, the features of its counterparts in the 4D-EGB AdS black hole under RPST, reinforcing the structural similarity between these seemingly different systems. Our findings point to a deeper correspondence between non-extensive entropy and holographic thermodynamics, suggesting that R\'enyi entropy may serve as a natural bridge between flat-space black hole thermodynamics and AdS holography.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>High to low temperature: $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</description>

      <title>Cosmological pole-skipping, shock waves and quantum chaotic dynamics of de Sitter horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of pole-skipping for scalar, Maxwell, and gravitational waves in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, working in empty de Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate the tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing on the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum chaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a gravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant pole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta. Interestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary, with the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming that a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory language and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled sectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly nonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector exhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we outline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian deformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that realize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Field Governs the Interior Spacetime of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop a large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity, achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions, fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes (on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions. This paper presents the detailed derivations and explanations that underlie a condensed letter version recently published in [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observations are potentially sensitive to new physics corrections to the Higgs potential once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises. We study the SMEFT dimension-six operator effects on the Higgs potential, where three types of effects are taken into account: (i) SMEFT tree level effect on $\varphi^6$ operator, (ii) SMEFT tree level effect on the wave function renormalization of the Higgs field, and (iii) SMEFT top-quark one-loop level effect. The sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these effects is numerically calculated by performing a Fisher matrix analysis. We find that the future gravitational wave observations can be sensitive to (ii) and (iii) once the first-order electroweak phase transition arises from (i). The dimension-eight $\varphi^8$ operator effects on the first-order electroweak phase transition are also discussed. The sensitivities of the future gravitational wave observations are also compared with those of future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

We show that the Bondi 4-momentum and angular momentum coincide with the relativistic definitions of 4-momentum and angular momentum for the system of pointlike bodies. The angular momentum computed at the null infinity is free of supertranslation ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds through the synergy of LISA and ET</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) interferometers LISA and ET are expected to be functional in the next decade(s), possibly around the same time. They will operate over different frequency ranges, with similar integrated sensitivities to the amplitude of a stochastic GW background (SGWB). We investigate the synergies between these two detectors, in terms of a multi-band detection of a cosmological SGWB characterised by a large amplitude, and a broad frequency spectrum. We develop the notion of integrated sensitivity and propose a novel signal-to-noise (SNR) optimal for characterization of the geometrical properties of the interferometer systems of LISA and ET operating simultaneously. By investigating various examples of SGWBs, such as those arising from cosmological phase transition, cosmic string, primordial inflation, we show that LISA and ET operating together will have the opportunity to assess more effectively the characteristics of the GW spectrum produced by the same cosmological source, but at separate frequency scales. Moreover, the two experiments in tandem can be sensitive to features of early universe cosmic expansion before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), which affects the SGWB frequency profile, and which would not be possible to detect otherwise, since two different frequency ranges correspond to two different pre-BBN (or post-inflationary) epochs. Besides considering the GW spectrum, we additionally undertake a preliminary study of the sensitivity of LISA and ET to soft limits of higher order tensor correlation functions. Given that these experiments operate at different frequency bands, their synergy constitutes an ideal direct probe of squeezed limits of higher order GW correlators, which can not be measured operating with a single instrument only.</description>

      <title>Statistics and Complexity of Wavefunction Spreading in Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the statistics of the results of a measurement of the spreading operator in the Krylov basis generated by the Hamiltonian of a quantum system starting from a specified initial pure state. We first obtain the probability distribution of the results of measurements of this spreading operator at a certain instant of time, and compute the characteristic function of this distribution. We show that the moments of this characteristic function are related to the so-called generalised spread complexities, and obtain expressions for them in several cases when the Hamiltonian is an element of a Lie algebra. Furthermore, by considering a continuum limit of the Krylov basis, we show that the generalised spread complexities of higher orders have a peak in the time evolution for a random matrix Hamiltonian belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble. We also obtain an upper bound on the change in generalised spread complexity at an arbitrary time in terms of the operator norm of the Hamiltonian and discuss the significance of these results.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics without Amperes Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistive magnetohydrodynamics is thought to play a key role in transient astrophysical phenomena such as black hole flares and neutron star magnetospheres. When performing numerical simulations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics, one is faced with the issue that Amperes law becomes stiff in the high conductivity limit which poses challenges to the numerical evolution. We show that using a description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics based on higher form symmetry, one can perform simulations with a generalized dual Faraday tensor without having to use Amperes Law, thereby avoiding the stiffness problem. We also explain the relation of this dual model to a traditional description of resistive magnetohydrodynamics and how causality is guaranteed by introducing second order corrections.</description>

      <title>On covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms: Weakly Isolated Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian description of classical gauge theories is a well studied subject. The two best known approaches, namely the covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms have received a lot of attention in the literature. However, in our opinion, a full understanding of the relation between them is not available, specially for gauge theories that are defined over regions with boundaries. Here we consider this issue, for spacetimes with isolated horizons as inner boundaries (representing black holes in equilibrium), and assess whether their corresponding descriptions can be seen as equivalent. First, we shall review and reanalyze both formalisms from anew, focusing on some subtleties not considered before. Next we show that, if we compare them at face value, there are subtle differences between both formalisms, for instance in the derivation of horizon energy, a physical observable of the theory, as well as in the number of boundary degrees of freedom. At first sight, it seems that the canonical formalism introduces some additional ambiguities that make more challenging the comparison between both formalisms. We analyze different possible interpretations in both approaches and show how one can obtain complete correspondence between results within covariant and canonical formalisms. We also show that the correspondence can be achieved in the original phase spaces, with no boundary degrees of freedom, or by appropriately extending them by adding horizon degrees of freedom. Along the way, we shed light on the role of boundary terms in the symplectic structure in relation to boundary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a key insight into the viability of classes of gravitational theories beyond general relativity. The observational constraints on their speed of propagation can provide strong constraints on generalized classes of broader gravitational frameworks. In this work, we reconsider the general class of Gauss-Bonnet theories in the context of teleparallel gravity, where the background geometry is expressed through torsion. We perform tensor perturbations on a flat FLRW background, and derive the gravitational wave propagation equation. We find that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light in these classes of theories. We also derive the distance-duality relationship for radiation propagating in the gravitational wave and electromagnetic domains.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>
