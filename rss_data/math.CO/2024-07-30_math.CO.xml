      <title>Optimizing the CGMS upper bound on Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe obtained the first exponential improvement of the upper bound on the diagonal Ramsey numbers since 1935. We shorten their proof, replacing the underlying book algorithm with a simple inductive statement. This modification allows us
  - to give a very short proof of an improved upper bound on the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, which extends to the multicolor setting, and
  - to clarify the dependence of the bounds on underlying parameters and optimize these parameters, obtaining, in particular, an upper bound $$R(k,k) \leq (3.8)^{k+o(k)}$$ on the diagonal Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>A note on edge colorings distinguishing all triangles in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider edge colorings of a graph in such a way that each two different triangles have distinct colorings. It is an extension of the well-known idea of distinguishing all maximal stars in a graph. It was introduced in literature in 1985 and studied by many authors in various variants, but always for stars. We estimate new invariants regarding triangles for proper and general colorings.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Perfectly Clustering Words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfectly clustering words are one of many possible generalizations of Christoffel words. In this article, we propose a factorization of a perfectly clustering word on a $n$ letters alphabet into a product of $n-1$ palindromes with a letter between each of them. This factorization allows us to generalize two combinatorial characterization of Christoffel words due to Pirillo (1999) and de Luca and Mignosi (1994).</description>

      <title>A Fan-type condition for cycles in $1$-tough and $k$-connected $(P_2\cup kP_1)$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $\mu_k(G):=\min~\{\max_{x\in S}d_G(x):~S\in \mathcal{S}_k\}$, where $\mathcal{S}_k$ is the set consisting of all independent sets $\{u_1,\ldots,u_k\}$ of $G$ such that some vertex, say $u_i$ ($1\leq i\leq k$), is at distance two from every other vertex in it. A graph $G$ is $1$-tough if for each cut set $S\subseteq V(G)$, $G-S$ has at most $|S|$ components. Recently, Shi and Shan \cite{Shi} conjectured that for each integer $k\geq 4$, being $2k$-connected is sufficient for $1$-tough $(P_2\cup kP_1)$-free graphs to be hamiltonian, which was confirmed by Xu et al. \cite{Xu} and Ota and Sanka \cite{Ota2}, respectively. In this article, we generalize the above results through the following Fan-type theorem: Let $k$ be an integer with $k\geq 2$ and let $G$ be a $1$-tough and $k$-connected $(P_2\cup kP_1)$-free graph with $\mu_{k+1}(G)\geq\frac{7k-6}{5}$, then $G$ is hamiltonian or the Petersen graph.</description>

      <title>Triangle decompositions of PG(n,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a triangle design as a partition of the set of $2$-dimensional subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space into triangles, where a triangle consists of three subspaces with the trivial, $0$-dimensional, intersection and $1$-dimensional mutual intersections. A triangle design is balanced if all nonzero vectors are involved in the same number of triangles. Over the binary field GF$(2)$, we construct balanced triangle designs for all admissible $n$ (congruent to $1$ modulo $6$) and an infinite class of balanced block-divisible triangle designs. We also prove that the existence of a triangle design over GF$(2)$ invariant under the action of the Singer cycle group is equivalent to the existence of a partition of $Z_{2^n-1}\backslash\{0\}$ into special $18$-subsets and find such designs for $n=7$, $13$, $19$.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters and backedge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19270v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph, an ordering of its vertices defines a backedge graph, namely the undirected graph whose edges correspond to the arcs pointing backwards with respect to the order. The degreewidth of a digraph is the minimum over all ordering of the maximum degree of the backedge graph. We answer an open question by Keeney and Lokshtanov [WG 2024], proving that it is \NP-hard to determine whether an oriented graph has degreewidth at most $1$, which settles the last open case for oriented graphs. We complement this result with a general discussion on parameters defined using backedge graphs and their relations to classical parameters.</description>

      <title>Number of roots of the continuant over a finite local ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to obtain a formula giving, for a positive integer $n$, the number of roots of the $n^{th}$ continuant polynomial over a finite local ring. In particular, we will give counting formulae for the roots of the continuant over the local rings $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, $\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\mathbb{Z}$ and $\frac{\mathbb{F}_{q}[X]}{&lt;X^{m}&gt;}$. To conclude, the methods used for the continuant will allow us to give a new and short proof of the counting formulae for $\lambda$-quiddities (which are the solutions of a matrix equation appearing in the study of Coxeter's friezes) over the rings $\mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Bollob\'as-Nikiforov Conjecture for graphs with not so many triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bollob\'as and Nikiforov conjectured that for any graph $G \neq K_n$ with $m$ edges \[ \lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2\le \bigg( 1-\frac{1}{\omega(G)}\bigg)2m\] where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ denote the two largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$, and $\omega$ denotes the clique number of $G$. This conjecture was recently verified for triangle-free graphs by Lin, Ning and Wu and for regular graphs by Zhang. Elphick, Wocjan and Linz proposed a generalization of this conjecture. In this note, we verify this generalized conjecture for the family of graphs on $m$ edges, which contain at most $O(m^{1.5-\varepsilon})$ triangles for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In particular, we show that the conjecture is true for planar graphs, book-free graphs and cycle-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Domination by kings is oddly even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $m \times n$ king graph consists of all locations on an $m \times n$ chessboard, where edges are legal moves of a chess king. %where each vertex represents a square on a chessboard and each edge is a legal move. Let $P_{m \times n}(z)$ denote its domination polynomial, i.e., $\sum_{S \subseteq V} z^{|S|}$ where the sum is over all dominating sets $S$. We prove that $P_{m \times n}(-1) = (-1)^{\lceil m/2\rceil \lceil n/2\rceil}$. In particular, the number of dominating sets of even size and the number of odd size differs by $\pm 1$. %The numbers can not be equal because the total number of dominating sets is always odd. This property does not hold for king graphs on a cylinder or a torus, or for the grid graph. But it holds for $d$-dimensional kings, where $P_{n_1\times n_2\times\cdots\times n_d}(-1) = (-1)^{\lceil n_1/2\rceil \lceil n_2/2\rceil\cdots \lceil n_d/2\rceil}$.</description>

      <title>Odd 4-coloring of outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper $k$-coloring of $G$ is called an odd coloring of $G$ if for every vertex $v$, there is a color that appears at an odd number of neighbors of $v$. This concept was introduced recently by Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski, and they conjectured that every planar graph is odd 5-colorable. Towards this conjecture, Caro, Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski showed that every outerplanar graph is odd 5-colorable, and this bound is tight since the cycle of length 5 is not odd 4-colorable. Recently, the first author and others showed that every maximal outerplanar graph is odd 4-colorable. In this paper, we show that a connected outerplanar graph $G$ is odd 4-colorable if and only if $G$ contains a block which is not a copy of the cycle of length 5. This strengthens the result by Caro, Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski, and gives a complete characterization of odd 4-colorable outerplanar graphs.</description>

      <title>Periodic Column Partial Sums in the Riordan Array of a Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $p(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, $k$-th column of the Riordan array $\bigl(1/(1 - t^{d+1}), tp(t)\bigr)$ is an eventually periodic sequence with the repeating part beginning at the $1 + (k-1)(d+1)$-st term. The pre-periodic terms add up to the $(k-1)(d+1)$-st partial sum of the corresponding formal power series, and thus the Riordan array of $p(t)$ generates a sequence of column partial sums. We classify linear and quadratic polynomials, and present a particular family of polynomials of higher degrees, for which such sequences of column partial sums are eventually periodic.</description>

      <title>Pattern-avoiding Cayley permutations via combinatorial species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cayley permutation is a word of positive integers such that if a letter appears in this word, then all positive integers smaller than that letter also appear. We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance on Cayley permutations adopting a combinatorial species approach. Our methods lead to species equations, generating series, and counting formulas for Cayley permutations avoiding any pattern of length at most three. We also introduce the species of primitive structures as a generalization of Cayley permutations with no "flat steps". Finally, we explore various notions of Wilf equivalence arising in this context.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Stanley--Yan log-concave matroid inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Stanley--Yan} (SY) \emph{inequality} gives the ultra-log-concavity for the numbers of bases of a matroid which have given sizes of intersections with $k$ fixed disjoint sets. The inequality was proved by Stanley (1981) for regular matroids, and by Yan (2023) in full generality. In the original paper, Stanley asked for equality conditions of the SY~inequality, and proved total equality conditions for regular matroids in the case $k=0$. In this paper, we completely resolve Stanley's problem. First, we obtain an explicit description of the equality cases of the SY inequality for $k=0$, extending Stanley's results to general matroids and removing the ``total equality'' assumption. Second, for $k\ge 1$, we prove that the equality cases of the SY inequality cannot be described in a sense that they are not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level.</description>

      <title>Transversal numbers of simplicial polytopes, spheres, and pure complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new upper and lower bounds on transversal numbers of several classes of simplicial complexes. Specifically, we establish an upper bound on the transversal numbers of pure simplicial complexes in terms of the number of vertices and the number of facets, and then provide constructions of pure simplicial complexes whose transversal numbers come close to this bound. We introduce a new family of $d$-dimensional polytopes that could be considered as ''siblings'' of cyclic polytopes and show that the transversal ratios of such odd-dimensional polytopes are $2/5-o(1)$. The previous record for the transversal ratios of $(2k+1)$-polytopes was $1/(k+1)$. Finally, we construct infinite families of $3$-, $4$-, and $5$-dimensional simplicial spheres with transversal ratios converging to $5/8$, $1/2$, and $6/11$, respectively. The previous record was $11/21$, $2/5$, and $1/2$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterated circumcenter sequence (ICS) in dimension $d$ is a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point is the circumcenter of the preceding $d+1$ points. The purpose of this paper is to completely determine the parameter space of ICSs and its subspace consisting of periodic ICSs. In particular, we prove Goddyn's conjecture on periodic ICSs, which was independently proven recently by Ardanuy. We also prove the existence of a periodic ICS in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Polynomial of Power Graphs on Direct Product of Any Two Finite Cyclic Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph $\mathscr{P}(G)$ of a group $G$ is defined as the simple graph with vertex set $G$, and where two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are joined by an edge if and only if either $x= y^k$ or $y= x^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Here we determine the characteristic polynomial of $\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{Z}_m \times \mathbb{Z}_{n})$ for any positive integers $m$ and $n$. Additionally, for some particular values of $m$ and $n$, we simplify the above characteristic polynomials and provide the full spectrum in a few cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a Borel graph all of whose finite subgraphs embed into the $d$-dimensional grid with diagonals. We show that then $G$ itself admits a Borel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\mathbb Z^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$ is replaced by $O(\rho \log \rho)$, where $\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetrized weight enumerators of pairs of Type II code over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$, which are invariants for a specified group, have been examined in this paper. It is shown that, for degrees 8 and 16, the space of the invariants ring of that group coincides with the ring generated from those weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>A visual approach to symmetric chain decompositions of finite Young lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite Young lattice $L(m, n)$ is rank-symmetric, rank-unimodal, and has the strong Sperner property. R. Stanley further conjectured that $L(m, n)$ admits a symmetric chain order. We show that the order structure on $L(m, n)$ is equivalent to a natural ordering on the lattice points of a dilated $n$-simplex, which in turn corresponds to a weight diagram for the root system of type $A_n$. Lindstr{\" o}m's symmetric chain decompositions for $L(3, n)$ are described completely through pictures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some kinds of generalizations of Schr\"oder paths below a line with rational slope and derive the $q$-difference equations that are satisfied by their generating functions. As a result, we establish a relation between the generating function of generalized Schr\"oder paths with backwards and the wave function corresponding to colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials of torus knot $T_{1,f}$. We also give a combinatorial proof of a recent result by Sto\v{s}i\'c and Su{\l}kowski, in which the standard generalized Schr\"oder paths are related to the superpolynomial of reduced colored HOMFLY-PT homology of $T_{1,f}$.</description>

      <title>A new framework for identifying most reliable graphs and a correction to the $K_{3,3}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite connected multigraph $G=(V,E)$, the all-terminal reliability function $R(G,p)$ is the probability that $G$ remains connected under percolation with parameter $p$. We develop new results concerning the question of which (multi)graphs~$G$ maximize $R(G,p)$ for a given number of vertices $n$, edges $m$ and a given parameter $p$ -- such graphs are called optimally reliable graphs -- paying particular attention to uniqueness and to whether the answer depends upon $p$.
  We generalize the concept of a distillation, and build a framework which we use to identify all optimally reliable graphs for which $m-n\in\{1,2,3\}$. These graphs are uniformly optimal in $p$. Many of them have been previously identified, but there are serious problems with these treatments, especially for the case $m-n=3$. We also obtain some partial results for $m-n\in\{4,5\}$.
  For $m-n=3$, the optimal graphs were incorrectly identified by Wang in 1994, in the infinite number of cases where $m\equiv 5 \pmod{9}$ and $m\geq 14$. This erroneous result, which concerns subdivisions of $K_{3,3}$, has been cited extensively and the mistake has not been detected. Furthermore, while the optimal graphs were correctly identified for other values of $m$, the proof is incorrect, as it also uses a claim for which we give a counterexample. Our proof of the rectified statement is self-contained.
  Regarding $m-n=4$, it was recently shown by Romero and Safe that the optimal graph depends upon $p$ for infinitely many $m$. We find a new such set of $m$-values, which gives a different perspective on why this phenomenon occurs. This leads us to conjecture that there are only finitely many $m$ for which there are uniformly optimal graphs when $m-n=4$, but that, for $m-n=5$, there are again infinitely many uniformly optimal graphs. We hope that our general results and methods will be useful for continued investigations.</description>

      <title>Multilevel polynomial partitioning and semialgebraic hypergraphs: regularity, Tur\'an, and Zarankiewicz results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove three results about semialgebraic hypergraphs. First, we prove an optimal and oblivious regularity lemma. Fox-Pach-Suk proved that the class of $k$-uniform semialgebraic hypergraphs satisfies a very strong regularity lemma where the vertex set can be partitioned into $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ pieces so that all but an $\varepsilon$-fraction of $k$-tuples of parts are homogeneous (either complete or empty). Our result improves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\varepsilon)^{d})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the complexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the edge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on both $\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal.
  From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\'an-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. We show that any such hypergraph with $N$ vertices and $\varepsilon N^k$ edges contains a complete $k$-uniform $k$-partite subhypergraph with $\Omega_{d,k}(D^{-d(k-1)}\varepsilon^{d(k-1)+1}N^k)$ edges.
  Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously, Fox-Pach-Sheffer-Suk-Zahl showed that a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most $O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to $K_{u,\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of these results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence on $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial.
  All three of these results follow from a novel "multilevel polynomial partitioning scheme" that efficiently partitions a point set $P\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ by low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this result using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which extends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth-Katz.</description>

Abstract: We review the work of Dominic Welsh (1938-2023), tracing his remarkable influence through his theorems, expository writing, students, and interactions. He was particularly adept at bringing different fields together and fostering the development of mathematics and mathematicians. His contributions ranged widely across discrete mathematics over four main career phases: discrete probability, matroids and graphs, computational complexity, and Tutte-Whitney polynomials. We give particular emphasis to his work in matroid theory and Tutte-Whitney polynomials.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for measures on distal classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Harman and Snowden introduced a notion of measure on a Fra\"iss\'e class $\mathfrak{F}$, and showed how such measures lead to interesting tensor categories. Constructing and classifying measures is a difficult problem, and so far only a handful of cases have been worked out. In this paper, we obtain some of the first general results on measures. Our main theorem states that if $\mathfrak{F}$ is distal (in the sense of Simon), and there are some bounds on automorphism groups, then $\mathfrak{F}$ admits only finitely many measures; moreover, we give an effective upper bound on their number. For example, if $\mathfrak{F}$ is the class of ``$s$-dimensional permutations'' (finite sets equipped with $s$ total orders), we show that the number of measures is bounded above by approximately $\exp(\exp(s^2 \log{s}))$.</description>

      <title>Bizonotopal Graphical Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

      <title>The $B_2$ index of galled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an effort to extend the classical notion of phylogenetic balance, originally defined in the context of trees, to networks. One of the most natural ways to do this is with the so-called $B_2$ index. In this paper, we study the $B_2$ index for a prominent class of phylogenetic networks: galled trees. We show that the $B_2$ index of a uniform leaf-labeled galled tree converges in distribution as the network becomes large. We characterize the corresponding limiting distribution, and show that its expected value is 2.707911858984... This is the first time that a balance index has been studied to this level of detail for a random phylogenetic network.
  One specificity of this work is that we use two different and independent approaches, each with its advantages: analytic combinatorics, and local limits. The analytic combinatorics approach is more direct, as it relies on standard tools; but it involves slightly more complex calculations. Because it has not previously been used to study such questions, the local limit approach requires developing an extensive framework beforehand; however, this framework is interesting in itself and can be used to tackle other similar problems.</description>

      <title>The rank of a random triangular matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider uniformly random strictly upper-triangular matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For such a matrix $A_n$, we show that $n-\operatorname{rank}(A_n) \approx \log_q n$ as $n \to \infty$, and find that the fluctuations around this limit are finite-order and given by explicit $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variables. More generally, we consider the random partition whose parts are the sizes of the nilpotent Jordan blocks of $A_n$: its $k$ largest parts (rows) were previously shown by Borodin to have jointly Gaussian fluctuations as $N \to \infty$, and its columns correspond to differences $\operatorname{rank}(A_n^{i-1}) - \operatorname{rank}(A_n^i)$. We show the fluctuations of the columns converge jointly to a discrete random point configuration $\mathcal{L}_{t,\chi}$ introduced in arXiv:2310.12275. The proofs use an explicit integral formula for the probabilities at finite $N$, obtained by de-Poissonizing a corresponding one in arXiv:2310.12275, which is amenable to asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $x$ be a $p$-adic integer. In this paper, we establish supercongruences for $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-4)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2} $$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-2)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $d\in\{0,1,2\}$. As consequences, we extend some known results. For example, for $p&gt;3$ we show $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom{3k}{k}\left(\frac{4}{27}\right)^k\equiv\frac19+\frac89p+\frac{4}{27}pE_{p-2}\left(\frac13\right)\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $E_n(x)$ denotes the Euler polynomial of degree $n$. This generalizes a known congruence of Z.-W. Sun.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the study of standard Lyndon loop words from [A.Negut, A.Tsymbaliuk, "Quantum loop groups and shuffle algebras via Lyndon words", Adv. Math. 439 (2024), Paper No. 109482] to a more general class of orders on the underlying alphabet, as suggested in Remark 3.15 of loc.cit. The main new ingredient is the exponent-tightness of these words, which also allows to generalize the construction of PBW bases of the untwisted quantum loop algebra via the combinatorics of loop words.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of representing an element of $\mathbb{F}_3^n$ as an element of $\mathbb{F}_n^2 \times \mathbb{F}_n^2$ which in practice will be a pair of unsigned integers. We show how to do addition, subtraction and pointwise multiplication and division of such vectors quickly using primitive binary operations (and, or, xor). We use this machinery to develop a fast algorithm for computing the permanent of a matrix in $\mathbb{F}_3^{n\times n}$. We present Julia code for a natural implementation of the permanent and show that our improved implementation gives, roughly, a factor of 80 speedup for problems of practical size. Using this improved code, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that suggest that the distribution of $\mbox{perm}(A)$ tends to the uniform distribution as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are numerous randomized algorithms to generate spanning trees in a given ambient graph; several target the uniform distribution on trees (UST), while in practice the fastest and most frequently used draw random weights on the edges and then employ a greedy algorithm to choose the minimum-weight spanning tree (MST). Though MST is a workhorse in applications, the mathematical properties of random MST are far less explored than those of UST. In this paper we develop tools for the quantitative study of random MST. We consider the standard case that the weights are drawn i.i.d. from a single distribution on the real numbers, as well as successive generalizations that lead to \emph{product measures}, where the weights are independently drawn from arbitrary distributions.</description>

      <title>Amalgamation and Symmetry: From Local to Global Consistency in The Finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.00031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generic construction of finite realisations of amalgamation patterns. An amalgamation pattern is specified by a finite collection of finite template structures together with a collection of partial isomorphisms between them. A realisation is a globally consistent solution to the locally consistent specification of this amalgamation problem: this is a single structure equipped with an atlas of distinguished substructures associated with the template structures, their overlaps realising precisely the identifications induced by the given partial isomorphisms. Our construction is based on natural reduced products with suitable groupoids. The resulting realisations are generic in the sense that they can be made to preserve all symmetries of the specification. They can also be made to be universal w.r.t.\ to local homomorphisms up to any specified size. As key applications of the main construction we discuss finite hypergraph coverings of specified levels of acyclicity and a new route to the lifting of local symmetries to global automorphisms in finite structures.</description>

Abstract: In this article we discuss classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of topological drawings and beyond. In a simple topological drawing of the complete graph $K_n$, any two edges share at most one point: either a common vertex or a point where they cross. Triangles of simple topological drawings can be viewed as convex sets. This gives a link to convex geometry.
  As our main result, we present a generalization of Kirchberger's Theorem that is of purely combinatorial nature. It turned out that this classical theorem also applies to "generalized signotopes" - a combinatorial generalization of simple topological drawings, which we introduce and investigate in the course of this article. As indicated by the name they are a generalization of signotopes, a structure studied in the context of encodings for arrangements of pseudolines.
  We also present a family of simple topological drawings with arbitrarily large Helly number, and a new proof of a topological generalization of Carath\'{e}odory's Theorem in the plane and discuss further classical theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of simple topological drawings.</description>

Abstract: The $(m,n)$-multiplihedron is a polytope whose faces correspond to $m$-painted $n$-trees, and whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the rotation lattice on binary $m$-painted $n$-trees. Deleting certain inequalities from the facet description of the $(m,n)$-multiplihedron, we construct the $(m,n)$-Hochschild polytope whose faces correspond to $m$-lighted $n$-shades, and whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the rotation lattice on unary $m$-lighted $n$-shades. Moreover, there is a natural shadow map from $m$-painted $n$-trees to $m$-lighted $n$-shades, which turns out to define a meet semilattice morphism of rotation lattices. In particular, when $m=1$, our Hochschild polytope is a deformed permutahedron whose oriented skeleton is the Hasse diagram of the Hochschild lattice.</description>

Abstract: Graph matching aims to find correspondences between two graphs. It is a fundamental task in pattern recognition. The classical spectral matching algorithm has time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ and space complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Such a complexity limits the applicability to large-scale graph matching tasks. This paper proposes an efficient redesign of spectral matching by transforming the graph matching problem into a 1D linear assignment problem, which can be solved efficiently by sorting two $n \times 1$ vectors. The resulting algorithm is named the lightning spectral assignment method (LiSA), which enjoys a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and the theoretical analysis of the strategy.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorially Rich sets were introduced by Bergelson and Glasscock for commutative semigroup. Latter Hindman, Hosseini, Strauss and Tootkaboni extended the definition of Combinatorially Rich sets for arbitrary semigroup. Recently Goswami proved that product of two Combinatorially Rich sets is also a Combinatorially Rich set. On the other hand Hindman and Leader were the first to introduce the concept of central sets near zero for dense semigroups of $\left(\left(0,\infty\right),+\right)$ and demonstrated an important combinatorial consequence regarding these sets. In this article we provided dynamical and combinatorial characterization of essential CR-sets near zero and explore the cartesian product of these sets.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>

Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.</description>

      <title>Proof of Lew's conjecture on the spectral gaps of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of graph Laplacians to higher dimensions, the combinatorial Laplacians of simplicial complexes have garnered increasing attention. Let $X$ be a simplicial complex on vertex set $V$ of size $n$, and let $X(k)$ denote the set of all $k$-dimensional simplices of $X$. The $k$-th spectral gap $\mu_k(X)$ is the smallest eigenvalue of the reduced $k$-dimensional Laplacian of $X$. For any $k\geq -1$, Lew [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 169 (2020) 105127] established a lower bound for $\mu_k(X)$: $$\mu_k(X)\geq (d+1)\left(\min_{\sigma\in X(k)}\deg_X(\sigma)+k+1\right)-dn\geq (d+1)(k+1)-dn,$$ where $\deg_X(\sigma)$ and $d$ denote the degree of $\sigma$ in $X$ and the maximal dimension of a missing face of $X$, respectively. In this paper, we identify the unique simplicial complex that achieves the lower bound of the $k$-th spectral gap, $(d+1)(k+1)-dn$, for some $k$, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by Lew.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a weakening of the Freiman isomorphisms between subsets of non necessarily abelian groups.
  Inspired by the breakthrough result of Kravitz, [14], on cyclic groups, as a first application, we prove that any subset of size $k$ of the dihedral group $D_{2m}$ (and, more in general, of a class of semidirect products) is sequenceable, provided that the prime factors of $m$ are larger than $k!$. Also, a refined bound of $k!/2$ for the size of the prime factors of $m$ can be obtained for cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_m$, slightly improving the result of [14]. Then, applying again the concept of weak Freiman isomorphism, we show that any subset of size $k$ of the dicyclic group $\mathrm{Dic}_{m}$ is sequenceable, provided that the prime factors of $m$ are larger than $k^k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hindman's theorem and van der Waerden's theorem are two classical Ramsey theoretic results, the first one deals with finite configurations and the second one deals with infinite configurations. The Central Sets Theorem due to Furstenberg is a strong simultaneous extension of both theorems, which also applies to general commutative semigroups. Beiglboeck provided a common extension of the Central Sets Theorem and Milliken-Taylor Theorem in commutative case. Furstenberg's original Central Sets Theorem was proved in \cite{key-2} for $\left(\mathbb{N},+\right)$ for finitely many sequences at a time. Bergelson and Hindman provided a non commutative version of this Theorem \cite{key-3}. The first author of this article jointly with Hindman and Straus provided a non-commutative version of Central Sets Theorem using arbitrary many sequence at a time \cite{key-5}. In this work we will provide a non-commutative extension of Beiglboeck's Theorem. We also provide polynomial generalization of Beiglbock's theorem.</description>

      <title>Sparse juntas on the biased hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.09428v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a structure theorem for Boolean functions on the $p$-biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to sparse juntas. Our structure theorem implies that such functions are $O(\epsilon^{C_d} + p)$-close to constant functions. We pinpoint the exact value of the constant $C_d$.
  We also give an analogous result for monotone Boolean functions on the biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to sparse DNFs.
  Our structure theorems are optimal in the following sense: for every $d,\epsilon,p$, we identify a class $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$ of degree $d$ sparse juntas which are $O(\epsilon)$-close to Boolean (in the monotone case, width $d$ sparse DNFs) such that a Boolean function on the $p$-biased hypercube is $O(\epsilon)$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$ iff it is $O(\epsilon)$-close to a function in $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex having $n$ faces of dimension $k$, and $M$ a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-dimensional manifold. We prove that for $k\ge3$ odd $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if there are
  $\bullet$ a skew-symmetric $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with $\mathbb Z$-entries whose rank over $\mathbb Q$ does not exceed $rk H_k(M;\mathbb Z)$,
  $\bullet$ a general position PL map $f:K\to\mathbb R^{2k}$, and
  $\bullet$ a collection of orientations on $k$-faces of $K$ such that for any nonadjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$ of $K$ the element $A_{\sigma,\tau}$ equals to the algebraic intersection of $f\sigma$ and $f\tau$.
  We prove some analogues of this result including those for $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability. Our results generalize the Bikeev-Fulek-Kyn\v cl-Schaefer-Stefankovi\v c criteria for the $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability of graphs to surfaces, and are related to the Harris-Krushkal-Johnson-Pat\'ak-Tancer criteria for the embeddability of $k$-complexes into $2k$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching Maps for Balls in Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it is the most efficient machine teaching model satisfying the Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \in \mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \in \mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD$(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\mathcal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.
  We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem B-NCTD$^+$ for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, B-NCTD$^+$ does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\text{vc})}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(\text{vc})}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number of $G$. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. These are extremely rare results: it is only the second problem in NP to admit such a tight double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc, and only one of very few problems to admit such an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional to its VC-dimension, and for Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate NCTM$^+$ of size 2.</description>

      <title>Exploring the space of graphs with fixed discrete curvatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $s$-pair state in a graph is a quantum state of the form $\mathbf{e}_u+s\mathbf{e}_v$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices in the graph and $s$ is a non-zero complex number. If $s=-1$ (resp., $s=1$), then such a state is called a pair state (resp. plus state). In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect $s$-pair state transfer in continuous quantum walks, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be the adjacency, Laplacian or signless Laplacian matrix of the graph. We characterize perfect $s$-pair state transfer in complete graphs, cycles and antipodal distance-regular graphs admitting vertex perfect state transfer. We construct infinite families of graphs with perfect $s$-pair state transfer using quotient graphs and graphs that admit fractional revival. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that perfect state transfer between vertices in the line graph relative to the adjacency matrix is equivalent to perfect state transfer between the plus states formed by corresponding edges in the graph relative to the signless Laplacian matrix. Finally, we characterize perfect state transfer between vertices in the line graphs of Cartesian products relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of diagonal digraphs, i.e. digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For a digraph $G$ and $\ell\geq 2,$ we describe a condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, equivalent to vanishing of the second magnitude homology group ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G,\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k&gt;\ell.$ In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2).$ As a corollary we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field; and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To obtain a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M,$ we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ via the homology of $M$. As a corollary we obtain that, if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>

Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>Lifted Hamming, Simplex and Reed-Muller Codes and Their Designs</title>

Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, settles the weight distributions of the lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes as well as the lifted Reed-Muller codes of certain orders, and investigates the $2$-designs and $3$-designs supported by these lifted codes. Infinite families of $2$-designs and $3$-designs are obtained. In addition, an infinite family of two-weight projective codes and two infinite families of three-weight projective codes are presented.</description>

      <title>A note on congruences for generalized cubic partitions modulo primes</title>

Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan, Sellers and Singh introduced the notion of a generalized cubic partition function $a_c(n)$ and proved two isolated congruences via modular forms, namely $a_3(7n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_5(11n+10)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. In this paper, we provide another proofs of these congruences using classical $q$-series manipulations. We also give an infinite family of congruences for $a_c(n)$ for primes $p\equiv 5,7\pmod{8}$ and other isolated congruences modulo $19,23$ and $31$ using modular forms.</description>
