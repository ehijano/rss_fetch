      <title>Subvolume method for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: topological charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the previously-developed sub-volume method to study the $\theta$-dependence of the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. We calculate the first two coefficients, the topological susceptibility $\chi$ and the fourth cumulant $b_2$, in the $\theta$-expansion of the free energy density around the critical temperature for the confinement-deconfinement transition. Lattice calculations are performed with three different spatial sizes $24^3,32^3,48^3$ to monitor finite size effects, while the temporal size is fixed to be $8$. The sub-volume method allows us to determine the values of $b_2$ much more accurately than the standard full-volume method, and we have successfully measured the temperature dependence of $b_2$ around the critical temperature. Our numerical results suggest that the $\theta$-dependence of the free energy density changes approximately from $4\chi(1-\cos(\theta/2))$ to $\chi(1-\cos\theta)$ near $\theta=0$ as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD estimates of thermal photon production from the QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal photons produced in heavy-ion collision experiments are an important observable for understanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The thermal photon rate from the QGP at a given temperature can be calculated from the spectral function of the vector current correlator. Extraction of the spectral function from the lattice correlator is known to be an ill-conditioned problem, as there is no unique solution for a spectral function for a given lattice correlator with statistical errors. The vector current correlator, on the other hand, receives a large ultraviolet contribution from the vacuum, which makes the extraction of the thermal photon rate difficult from this channel. We therefore consider the difference between the transverse and longitudinal part of the spectral function, only capturing the thermal contribution to the current correlator, simplifying the reconstruction significantly. The lattice correlator is calculated for light quarks in quenched QCD at $T=470~$MeV ($\sim 1.5\, T_c$), as well as in 2+1 flavor QCD at $T=220~$MeV ($\sim 1.2 \, T_{pc}$) with $m_{\pi}=320$ MeV. In order to quantify the non-perturbative effects, the lattice correlator is compared with the corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{LPM}^{\text{LO}}$ estimate of correlator. The reconstruction of the spectral function is performed in several different frameworks, ranging from physics-informed models of the spectral function to more general models in the Backus-Gilbert method and Gaussian Process regression. We find that the resulting photon rates agree within errors.</description>

      <title>Form factor for Dalitz decays from $J/\psi$ to light pseudoscalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the form factor $M(q^2)$ for the Dalitz decay $J/\psi\to \gamma^*(q^2)\eta_{(N_f=1)}$ with $\eta_{(N_f)}$ being the SU($N_f$) flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson. The difference among the partial widths $\Gamma(J/\psi\to \gamma \eta_{(N_f)})$ at different $N_f$ can be attributed in part to the $\mathbf{U}_A(1)$ anomaly that induces a $N_f$ scaling. $M(q^2)$'s in $N_f=1,2$ are both well described by the single pole model $M(q^2)=M(0)/(1-q^2/\Lambda^2)$. Combined with the known experimental results of the Dalitz decays $J/\psi\to Pe^+e^-$, the pseudoscalar mass $m_P$ dependence of the pole parameter $\Lambda$ is approximated by $\Lambda(m_P^2)=\Lambda_1(1-m_P^2/\Lambda_2^2)$ with $\Lambda_1=2.64(4)~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_2=2.97(33)~\mathrm{GeV}$. These results provide inputs for future theoretical and experimental studies on the Dalitz decays $J/\psi\to Pe^+e^-$.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading-Order Weak Annihilation Correction to Rare $B \to \left \{K, \pi \right \} \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the next-to-leading-order computation of the weak annihilation contribution to the exclusive electroweak penguin decays $B \to \left \{K, \pi \right \} \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ with an energetic light-flavour meson, which is an essential missing piece of the complete QCD correction to the matrix elements of hadronic operators in the weak effective Hamiltonian. Both the hard functions and the jet functions in the perturbative factorization formulae from the short-distance fluctuations at the two distinct scales $m_b$ and $\sqrt{m_b \, \Lambda}$ are determined at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ with the soft-collinear factorization technique. We then demonstrate that the one-loop weak annihilation correction can bring about the noticeable impacts on theory predictions for the CP asymmetries and the isospin asymmetry in the $B \to \pi \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium scaling of the energy density along the critical relaxational flow after a quench of the temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium behavior of statistical systems along critical relaxational flows arising from instantaneous quenches of the temperature $T$ to the critical point $T_c$, starting from equilibrium conditions at time $t=0$. In the case of soft quenches, i.e. when the initial temperature $T$ is assumed sufficiently close to $T_c$ (to keep the system within the critical regime), the critical modes develop an out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (FSS) behavior in terms of the rescaled time variable $\Theta=t/L^z$, where $t$ is the time interval after quenching, $L$ is the size of the system, and $z$ is the dynamic exponent associated with the dynamics. However, the realization of this picture is less clear when considering the energy density, whose equilibrium scaling behavior (corresponding to the starting point of the relaxational flow) is generally dominated by a temperature-dependent regular background term or mixing with the identity operator. These issues are investigated by numerical analyses within the three-dimensional lattice $N$-vector models, for $N=3$ and $N=4$, which provide examples of critical behaviors with negative values of the specific-heat critical exponent $\alpha$, implying that also the critical behavior of the specific heat gets hidden by the background term. The results show that, after subtraction of its asymptotic critical value at $T_c$, the energy density develops an asymptotic out-of-equilibrium FSS in terms of $\Theta$ as well, whose scaling function appears singular in the small-$\Theta$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within a 2+1 flavor Nambu\textendash Jona-Lasinio model, we have calculated the curvature coefficients and checked them against available lattice QCD estimations. With the observation that the flavor mixing due to the `t Hooft determinant term significantly affects the $\kappa_{2}^{S}$, we explore the effect of $\mu_{S}$ on the $T-\mu_{B}$ cross-over lines. With the novel determination of negative $\kappa_{2}^{B}$ at large $\mu_{S}$, we advocate the importance of studying the same in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Low-mode deflation for twisted-mass and RHMC reweighting in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose improved estimators to compute the reweighting factors which are needed for lattice QCD calculations that rely on twisted-mass reweighting for the light quark contribution and the Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC) algorithm for non-degenerate quark masses. This is the case for a number of modern large-scale simulations based on O(a) improved Wilson fermions. We find a significant reduction of uncertainties for the reweighting factors at similar computational cost compared to the conventional estimation. This leads to a significant increase in precision for phenomenologically relevant observables with high correlation to the low eigenmodes of the Wilson-Dirac operator in the presence of exceptionally small eigenvalues. Supplementary details regarding the spectral gap of the light quark Dirac operator on the 2+1 flavor large-volume ensembles explored in this study can be found in an accompanying appendix.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the Parton Momentum-Fraction Dependence of Generalized Parton Distributions from Exclusive Photoproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $x$ dependence of hadrons' generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $\mathcal{F}(x,\xi,t)$ is the most difficult to extract from the existing known processes, while the $\xi$ and $t$ dependence are uniquely determined by the kinematics of the scattered hadron. We study the single diffractive hard exclusive processes for extracting GPDs in the photoproduction. We demonstrate quantitatively the enhanced sensitivity on extracting the $x$ dependence of various GPDs from the photoproduction cross sections, as well as the asymmetries constructed from photon polarization and hadron spin that could be measured at JLab Hall D by GlueX Collaboration and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Form Factors of the Tricritical Three-state Potts Model in its Scaling Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the form factors of the order and disorder operators, together with those of the stress-energy tensor, of the two-dimensional three-state Potts model with vacancies along its thermal deformation of the critical point. At criticality the model is described by the non-diagonal partition function of the unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}_{6,7}$ of conformal field theories and is accompanied by an internal $S_3$ symmetry. Its off-critical thermal deformation is an integrable massive theory which is still invariant under $S_3$. The presence of infinitely many conserved quantities, whose spin spectrum is related to the exceptional Lie algebra $E_6$, allows us to determine the analytic $S$-matrix, the exact mass spectrum and the matrix elements of local operators of this model in an exact non-perturbative way. We use the spectral representation series of the correlators and the fast convergence of these series to compute several universal ratios of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quantum utility: simulating large-scale quantum spin chains on superconducting quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the quantum simulation of the frustrated quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with competing nearest-neighbor $(J_1)$ and next-nearest-neighbor $(J_2)$ exchange interactions in the real superconducting quantum computer with qubits ranging up to 100. In particular, we implement, for the first time, the Hamiltonian with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>
