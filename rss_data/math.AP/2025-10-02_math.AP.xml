      <title>Classification of solutions of an elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any classical solution of the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi (DHJ) equation $-\Delta u= |\nabla u|^p$ in a half-space with zero boundary conditions for $1&lt;p\le 2$ is necessarily one-dimensional. This improves the previously known result, which required an extra assumption of boundedness from above. Combined with the existing analogous result for $p&gt;2$, our result completes the full classification picture of the Dirichlet problem for equation (DHJ) in a half-space.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg-Nash strategy for the null controllability of semilinear degenerate equations in non-cylindrical domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Stackelberg-Nash strategy to show the local null controllability of a semilinear parabolic equation in one-dimension defined in a non-cylindrical domain where the diffusion coefficient degenerates at one point of the boundary. The linearized degenerated system is treated using a Carleman inequality for degenerated non-autonomous systems proved by the autors in [19] and the local controllability of the semilinear system is obtained using Liusterniks inverse function theorem.</description>

      <title>Integrated Local Energy Decay for Waves with Time-Dependent Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove integrated local energy decay for solutions of the damped wave equation with time-dependent damping satisfying an appropriate generalization of the geometric control condition on asymptotically flat, stationary space-times. We first obtain a high frequency estimate, which we prove via a positive commutator estimate using an escape function explicitly constructed in terms of the damping around individual space-time trajectories. We combine the high frequency estimate with low and medium frequency results for the undamped problem, then we handle the damping term as a perturbation to obtain local energy decay.</description>

      <title>Very Weak Solutions and Asymptotic Behavior of Leray Solutions to the Stationary Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\bfu$ be a Leray solution to the Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem in an exterior domain, vanishing at infinity and satisfying the generalized energy inequality. We show that if there exist $R&gt;0$ and ${\sf s}\ge \frac23 q$, $q&gt;6$, such that the $L^{\sf s}-$norm of $\bfu$ on the spherical surface of radius $R$ divided by $R$ is less than a constant depending only on {\sf s} and $q$, then $\bfu(x)$ must decay as $|x|^{-1}$ for $|x|\to\infty$. This result is proved with an approach based on a new theory of very weak solutions in exterior domains which, as such, is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of solutions for discrete semilinear wave equation with the scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the blow-up problem for discretized scale-invariant nonlinear dissipative wave equations. It is known that the critical exponents for undiscretized equations (continuous equations) are given by Fujita and Strauss exponents depending on the space dimensions. Our purpose is to obtain results for the discretized equations that correspond to those shown for the continuous one. The proof is based on Matsuya [6], who showed the blow-up problem for discrete semilinear wave equations without dissipative terms, and we found that the result is sharp in the case of one and two space dimensions compared to the continuous equations.</description>

      <title>On Sharp Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we summarize the linearization method to study the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles, and explain that the same approach can be used to handle the stability problem. As examples of application, combining with spherical harmonic decomposition and the Hardy inequalities, we revise two families of inequalities. We give firstly an affirmative answer in dimension four to Cazacu-Flynn-Lam's conjecture [JFA, 2022] for the sharp Hydrogen Uncertainty Principle, and improve the recent estimates of Chen-Tang [arXiv:2508.15221v1] in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, we identify the best constants and extremal functions for two stability estimates associated to $\|\Delta u\|_2 \|r\nabla u\|_2 - \frac{N+2}{2}\|\nabla u\|^2_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 2$), studied recently by Duong-Nguyen [CVPDE, 2025] and Do-Lam-Lu-Zhang [arXiv:2505.02758v1].</description>

      <title>Stability of Lamb dipoles for odd-symmetric and non-negative initial disturbances without the finite mass condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the stability of the Lamb dipole solution of the two-dimensional Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and question under which initial disturbance the Lamb dipole is stable, motivated by experimental work on the formation of a large vortex dipole in two-dimensional turbulence. We assume (O) odd symmetry for the $x_2$-variable and (N) non-negativity in the upper half plane for the initial disturbance of vorticity, and establish the stability theorem of the Lamb dipole without assuming (F) finite mass condition. The proof is based on a new variational characterization of the Lamb dipole using an improved energy inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Cauchy problem for the Zakharov-Rubenchik/Benney-Roskes system. Our method is based on the dispersive estimates and the suitable Bourgain's spaces. We then, obtain the local well-posedness of the solution with the main component $\psi$ belongs to $H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ ($d=2, 3$) which is actually the energy space corresponding to this component. Our result also suggests a potential approach to the problem of finding exact existence time scale for the solution of Benney-Roskes model in the context of water waves.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates and its application to the well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on H-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to give the well-posedness results for the Cauchy problem of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power type nonlinearities on H-type groups. To do this, we prove the dispersive estimate and Strichartz estimate. Although these estimates are given by Hierro (2005), its complete proofs cannot be find. We correct the statement of these estimates, give the proofs, and apply to the nonlinear problem. Our well-posedness results are an improvement of the previous result by Bruno et al.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes: Biological propagation via reaction-diffusion equations with nonlocal diffusion and free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on the lectures given in a mini-course at VIASM (Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics) 2025 Summer School. They give a brief account of the theory (with detailed proofs) for propagation governed by a nonlocal reaction-diffusion model with free boundaries in one space dimension. The main part is concerned with a KPP reaction term, though the basic results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as on the comparison principles are for more general situations. The contents are mostly taken from published recent works of the author with several collaborators, where the kernel function was assumed to be symmetric: J(x)=J(-x). When J(x) is not symmetric, significant differences may arise in the dynamics of the model, as shown in several preprints quoted in the references at the end of these notes, but many of the existing techniques can be easily extended to cover the "weakly non-symmetric case", and this is done here with all the necessary details.</description>

      <title>Convergence to a receding wave in a monostable free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a monostable reaction-diffusion equation of the form $u_t=du_{xx}+f(u)$ over a semi-infinite spatial domain $[g(t),\infty)$, with $x=g(t)$ the free boundary whose evolution is governed by equations derived from a ``preferred population density'' principle, which postulates that the species with population density $u(t,x)$ and population range $[g(t),\infty)$ maintains a certain density $\delta$ at the habitat edge $x=g(t)$. In the ``high-density'' regime, where $\delta$ exceeds the carrying capacity of the favourable environment represented by a monostable function $f(u)$, it is known (see \cite{DLNS} for the case of a bounded population range $[g(t), h(t)]$) that for large time, the front retreats as time advances. In this work, the unboundedness of the population range $[g(t),\infty)$ allows us to prove that, as time $t$ converges to infinity, the free boundary $x=g(t)$ converges to $\infty$ with a constant asymptotic speed $c(\delta)&gt;0$ determined by an associated semi-wave problem, and the population density $u(t,x)$ has the property that $u(t,x+g(t))$ converges uniformly to $q_{c(\delta)}(x)$, the semi-wave profile function associated with the speed $c(\delta)$. It turns out that in the retreating situation considered here, some key techniques developed for advancing fronts in related free boundary models do not work anymore. This difficulty is overcome here by a ``touching method", which uses a family of lower and upper solutions constructed from semi-waves of some carefully designed auxiliary problems to touch the solution $u(t,x)$ at the moving boundary $x=g(t)$, thereby generating a setting where the comparison principle can be used to obtain the desired estimates for $g'(t)$ and $u(t,x)$. We believe this method will find applications elsewhere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the quasilinear subelliptic function derived from H\"ormander vector fields. Based on the significant work of J. Serrin in \cite{SER}, M. Meier in \cite{MM1}, and L. Capogna, D. Danielli and N. Garofalo in \cite{LC1,LDN}, we obtain the removable singularities and Harnack inequality by a sharp Sobolev inequalities under weaker integrability of coefficients in structure conditions. Furthermore, we get the H\"older continuity when domain $\Omega$ is equiregular.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions and incompressible limit of two-dimensional isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with ripped density and large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak solutions to isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with ripped density in the whole plane provided the bulk viscosity coefficient is properly large. Moreover, we show that such solutions converge globally in time to a weak solution of the inhomogeneous incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations when the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity. In particular, the initial data can be arbitrarily large and vacuum states are allowed in interior regions. Our method relies on the effective viscous flux and a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning incompressible limit of isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations for the large bulk viscosity.</description>

      <title>Compactness of conformal metrics with constant $Q$-curvature of higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\ge1$ be a positive integer and let $P_g$ be the GJMS operator $P_{g}$ of order $2k$ on a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n&gt;2k$. We investigate the compactness of the set of conformal metrics to $g$ with prescribed constant positive $Q$-curvature of order $2k$- or, equivalently, of the set of positive solutions for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation. Under a natural positivity-preserving condition on $P_{g}$ we establish compactness, for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, under the following assumptions: $(M,g)$ is locally conformally flat and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $2k+1 \le n \le 2k+5$ and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $n \ge 2k+4$ and $|\text{W}_g|_g &gt;0$ in $M$.
  For an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the expression of $P_g$ is not explicit, which is an obstacle to proving compactness. We overcome this by relying on Juhl's celebrated recursive formulae for $P_g$ to perform a refined blow-up analysis for solutions of the $Q$-curvature equation and to prove a Weyl vanishing result for $P_g$. This is the first compactness result for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$ and the first successful instance where Juhl's formulae are used to yield compactness. Our result also hints that the threshold dimension for compactness for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation diverges as $k \to + \infty$.</description>

      <title>Existence of multiple normalized solutions to a critical growth Choquard equation involving mixed operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the normalized solutions of the following critical growth Choquard equation with mixed local and non-local operators:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
  -\Delta u +(-\Delta)^s u &amp; = &amp; \lambda u +\mu |u|^{p-2}u +(I_{\alpha}*|u|^{2^*_{\alpha}})|u|^{2^*_{\alpha}-2}u \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N;\;\;
  \left\| u \right\|_2 &amp; = &amp; \tau,
  \end{array}

      <title>Exponential Dichotomies in Higher-Dimensional Spatial Dynamics for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential dichotomies, when they exist, provide powerful information about the structure of bounded solutions even in the case of an ill-posed evolutionary equation. The method of spatial dynamics, in which one views a spatial variable as a time-like evolutionary variable, allows for the use of classical dynamical systems techniques, such as exponential dichotomies, in broader contexts. This has been utilized to study stationary, traveling wave, time-periodic, and spiral wave solutions of PDEs on spatial domains with a distinguished unbounded direction (e.g. the real line or a channel of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\Omega$). Recent work has shown how to extend the spatial dynamics framework to elliptic PDEs posed on general multi-dimensional spatial domains. In this paper, we show that, in the same context, exponential dichotomies exist, thus allowing for their use in future analyses of coherent structures, such as spatial patterns in reaction-diffusion equations on more general domains.</description>

      <title>A Unified H\"older Lebesgue Framework for Caffarelli Kohn Nirenberg Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified H\"older Lebesgue scale \(X^p\) and its weighted, higher order variants \(X^{k,p,a}\) to extend the Caffarelli Kohn Nirenberg (CKN) inequality beyond the classical Lebesgue regime. Within this framework we prove a two parameter interpolation theorem that is continuous in the triplet \((k,1/p,a)\) and bridges integrability and regularity across the Lebesgue H\"older spectrum. As a consequence we obtain a generalized CKN inequality on bounded punctured domains \(\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}\); the dependence of the constant on \(\Omega\) is characterized precisely by the (non)integrability of the weights at the origin. At the critical endpoint \(p=n\) we establish a localized, weighted Brezis Wainger type bound via Trudinger Moser together with a localized weighted Hardy lemma, yielding an endpoint CKN inequality with a logarithmic loss. Sharp constants are not pursued; rather, we prove existence of constants depending only on the structural parameters and coarse geometry of \(\Omega\). Several corollaries, including a unified Hardy--Sobolev inequality, follow from the same interpolation mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study boundary regularity for the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for $2s$-stable operators in generalized H\"older spaces. Moreover, we provide explicit counterexamples that showcase the sharpness of our results. Our approach directly addresses the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem, rather than subtracting an appropriate extension of the exterior data. Even for the fractional Laplacian, our result is new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem was recently introduced by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang, which seeks to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given finite Borel measure such that it is the $L_p$ chord measure of a convex body. In this paper, we solve the $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem for the super-critical exponents by combining a nonlocal Gauss curvature flow introduced in \cite{HHLW exi} and a topological argument developed in \cite{GLW2022}. Notably, we provide a simplified argument for the topological part.</description>

      <title>On the vanishing viscosity limit for incompressible flows with inflow/outflow boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vanishing viscosity limit for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in a general bounded domain with inflow-outflow boundary conditions. Extending the work of Gie, Hamouda, and Temam ( Netw. Heterog. Media 7, 2012) and also of Lombardo and Sammartino (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 33, 2001), we allow for a general injection and suction angle, as long as it is bounded away from zero. We rigorously establish the convergence of NSE solutions to those of the Euler equations (EE) as viscosity vanishes in the energy norm. We prove interior convergence in both the $L^2$ and the Sobolev $H^1$ norms at the same rates as in the case of injection/suction normal to the boundary. The proof relies on the construction of boundary layer correctors via Prandtl-type equations and a higher-order asymptotic expansion that improves the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically compatible entropy-consistent discretization for a class of nonlocal conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws modeling traffic flows, given by $ \partial_t \rho_\varepsilon + \partial_x(V(\rho_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon) \rho_\varepsilon) = 0 $ with a suitable convex kernel $ \gamma_\varepsilon $, and its Godunov-type numerical discretization. We prove that, as the nonlocal parameter $ \varepsilon $ and mesh size $ h $ tend to zero simultaneously, the discrete approximation $ W_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $ W_\varepsilon := \rho_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon $ converges to the entropy solution of the (local) scalar conservation law $ \partial_t \rho + \partial_x(V(\rho) \rho) = 0 $, with an explicit convergence rate estimate of order $ \varepsilon+h+\sqrt{\varepsilon\, t}+\sqrt{h\,t} $. In particular, with an exponential kernel, we establish the same convergence result for the discrete approximation $ \rho_{\varepsilon,h} $ of $ \rho_\varepsilon $, along with an $ \mathrm{L}^1 $-contraction property for $ W_\varepsilon $. The key ingredients in proving these results are uniform $ \mathrm{L}^\infty $- and $\mathrm{TV}$-estimates that ensure compactness of approximate solutions, and discrete entropy inequalities that ensure the entropy admissibility of the limit solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the bifurcation diagrams of positive solutions for a one-dimensional diffusive generalized logistic boundary-value problem with the Minkowski curvature operator and constant yield harvesting. We prove that the corresponding bifurcation curves on both the (lambda, sup-norm of u)-plane and the (mu, sup-norm of u)-plane are C-shaped. Furthermore, by characterizing the bifurcation set on the (mu, lambda)-plane, we determine the exact multiplicity of positive solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under natural assumptions on curvature and cross section, we establish the uniqueness of asymptotic limits and the exponential convergence rate for complete noncollapsed Ricci-flat manifolds with linear volume growth, which are known to only admit cylindrical asymptotic limits. In dimension four, these assumptions hold automatically, yielding unconditional uniqueness and convergence. In particular, our results show that all asymptotically cylindrical Calabi--Yau manifolds converge exponentially to their asymptotic limits, thereby answering affirmatively a question by Haskins--Hein--Nordstr\"om. In dimension four our result strengthens those of Chen--Chen, who proved exponential convergence to its asymptotic limit space for any ALH instanton.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a class of control problems where the initial datum acts as a control and the state is given by the entropy solution of (local) conservation laws by a nonlocal-to-local limiting strategy. In particular we characterize the limit up to subsequence of minimizers to nonlocal control problems as minimizer of the corresponding local ones. Moreover, we also prove an analogous result at a discrete level by means of a Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme.</description>

      <title>Spectral minimal partitions of unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing $k$-spectral minimal partitions of domains in $d$ dimensions, where the energy functional to be minimized is a $p$-norm ($1 \le p \le \infty$) of the infimum of the spectrum of a suitable Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$, with Dirichlet conditions on the boundary of the partition elements (cells). The main novelty of this paper is that the domains may be unbounded, including of infinite volume.
  First, we prove a sharp upper bound for the infimal energy among all $k$-partitions by a threshold value which involves the infimum $\Sigma$ of the essential spectrum of the Schr\"odinger operator on the whole domain as well as the infimal energy among all $k-1$-partitions. Strictly below such threshold, we develop a concentration-compactness-type argument showing optimal partitions exist, and each cell admits ground states (i.e., the infimum of the spectrum on each cell is a simple isolated eigenvalue).
  Second, for $p&lt;\infty$, when the energy and the threshold level coincide, we show there may or may not be minimizing partitions. Moreover, even when these exist, they may not have ground states.
  Third, for $p=\infty$, minimal partitions always exist, even at the threshold level, but these may or may not admit ground states. Moreover, below the threshold, we can always construct a minimizer, which is an equipartition. At the threshold value we show that spectral minimal partitions may not need to be equipartitions.
  We give a variety of examples of both domains and potentials to illustrate the new phenomena that occur in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider funnel control for linear infinite-dimensional systems that are impedance passive, meaning that they satisfy an energy balance in which the stored energy equals the squared norm of the state and the supplied power is the inner product of input and output. For the analysis we employ the system node approach, which offers a unified framework for infinite-dimensional systems with boundary and distributed control and observation. The resulting closed-loop dynamics are governed by a nonlinear evolution equation; we establish its solvability and hence the applicability of funnel control to this class. The applicability is illustrated by an Euler-Bernoulli beam, which is studied in two distinct scenarios: once with boundary control and once with distributed control.</description>

      <title>A viscosity solution approach to the large deviation principle for stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops the viscosity solution approach to the large deviation principle for the following two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d,\ d\in\{2,3\}$ with small noise intensity:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{u}_n+[-\mu\Delta\boldsymbol{u}_n+ (\boldsymbol{u}_n\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}_n +\alpha\boldsymbol{u}_n+\beta|\boldsymbol{u}_n|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}_n+\nabla p_n]\mathrm{d} t=\boldsymbol{f}\mathrm{d} t+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\mathrm{Q}^{\frac12}\mathrm{d}\mathrm{W}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}_n=0,
  \end{align*} where $\mu,\alpha,\beta&gt;0$, $r\in[1,\infty)$, $\mathrm{Q}$ is a trace class operator and $\mathrm{W}$ is Hilbert-valued calendrical Wiener process. We build our analysis on the framework of Varadhan and Bryc, together with the techniques of [J. Feng et.al., Large Deviations for Stochastic Processes, American Mathematical Society (2006) vol. \textbf{131}]. By employing the techniques from the comparison principle, we identify the Laplace limit as the convergence of the viscosity solution of the associated second-order singularly perturbed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A key advantage of this method is that it establishes a Laplace principle without relying on additional sufficient conditions such as Bryc's theorem, which the literature commonly requires. For $r&gt;3$ and $r=3$ with $2\beta\mu\geq1$, we also derive the exponential moment bounds without imposing the classical orthogonality condition $((\boldsymbol{u}_n\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}_n,\mathrm{A}\boldsymbol{u}_n)=0$, where $\mathrm{A}=-\Delta$, in both two-and three-dimensions. We first establish the large deviation principle in the Skorohod space. Then, by using the $\mathrm{C}-$exponential tightness, we finally establish the large deviation principle in the continuous space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of some non-local equations defined on Dirichlet spaces equipped with sub-gaussian estimates for the heat kernel associated to the generator. We prove that weak solutions for homogeneous equations involving pure powers of the generator are actually H\"older continuous and satisfy an Harnack inequality. Our methods are based on a version of the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension method which is valid in any Dirichlet space and our results complement the existing literature on solutions of PDEs on classes of Dirichlet spaces such as fractals.</description>

      <title>Impact of diffusion mechanisms on persistence and spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a generalized KPP equation with a ``$q$-diffusion", which is a framework that unifies various standard linear diffusion regimes: Fickian diffusion ($q = 0$), Stratonovich diffusion ($q = 1/2$), Fokker-Planck diffusion ($q = 1$), and nonstandard diffusion regimes for general $q\in\mathbb{R}$. Using both analytical methods and numerical simulations, we explore how the ability of persistence (measured by some principal eigenvalue) and how the asymptotic spreading speed depend on the parameter $q$ and on the phase shift between the growth rate $r(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$.
  Our results demonstrate that persistence and spreading properties generally depend on $q$: for example, appropriate configurations of $r(x)$ and $D(x)$ can be constructed such that $q$-diffusion either enhances or diminishes the ability of persistence and the spreading speed with respect to the traditional Fickian diffusion. We show that the spatial arrangement of $r(x)$ with respect to $D(x)$ has markedly different effects depending on whether $q &gt; 0$, $q = 0$, or $q &lt; 0$. The case where $r$ is constant is an exception: persistence becomes independent of $q$, while the spreading speed displays a symmetry around $q = 1/2$.
  This work underscores the importance of carefully selecting diffusion models in ecological and epidemiological contexts, highlighting their potential implications for persistence, spreading, and control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove minimality of the zero level set with respect to a certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In addition, we obtain that the zero level set of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation has zero mean curvature. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture in it's original statement, without the limiting assumption of O. Savin, by reducing it to classical Bernstein type results for minimal graphs, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>

      <title>Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimates for double phase problems with matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an optimal Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory for nonuniformly elliptic double phase problems with matrix weights. For $1&lt;p&lt;q&lt;\infty$, $a(\cdot)\in C^{0,\alpha}(\Omega)$ ($0&lt;\alpha\le1$), and a symmetric, almost everywhere positive definite matrix weight $\M$ with $|\M(x)|\,|\M(x)^{-1}|\le\Lambda$ for some constant $\Lambda\ge 1$ and small $|\log \M|_{\mathrm{BMO}}$, we prove, for every $\gamma&gt;1$, $$ (|\M F|^p+a(x)|\M F|^q)\in L^\gamma_{\mathrm{loc}} \;\Longrightarrow\; (|\M Du|^p+a(x)|\M Du|^q)\in L^\gamma_{\mathrm{loc}}. $$ Our argument combines a freezing of the logarithm of the matrix field, $\log \M$, with a fractional maximal-operator method governed by the Muckenhoupt-Wheeden $\mathcal{A}_{p,s}$ classes (where $1/s=1/p-\alpha/(nq)$). This yields scale-invariant comparison and level-set estimates and precludes Lavrentiev gaps at the sharp threshold $q/p\le 1+\alpha/n$. Our result recovers the identity case $\,\M\equiv {\rm I}_n\,$, i.e., the classical (unweighted) Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory for double-phase problems.</description>

      <title>Global convergence rates in the relaxation limits for the compressible Euler and Euler-Maxwell systems in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two relaxation problems in the class of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems: the compressible Euler system and the compressible Euler-Maxwell system. In classical Sobolev spaces, we derive a global convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ between strong solutions of the relaxed Euler system and the porous medium equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq1$) for \emph{ill-prepared} initial data. In a well-prepared setting, we derive an enhanced convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ between the solutions of the relaxed compressible Euler system and their first-order asymptotic approximation. Regarding the relaxed Euler-Maxwell system, we prove the global strong convergence of its solutions to the drift-diffusion model in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in an \emph{ill-prepared} setting. These results are achieved by developing a new asymptotic expansion approach that, combined with stream function techniques, ensures uniform-in-time error estimates.</description>

      <title>Exact Poincar\'e Constants in three-dimensional Annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3d-annuli. In our non-dimensional setting each annulus ${\Omega}_{\cal A}$ is defined via two concentrical balls with radii ${\cal A}/2$ and ${\cal A}/2 +1$. For these geometries we provide the exact value for the Poincar\'e constants for scalar functions and calculate precise Poincar\'e constants for solenoidal vector fields (in both cases with vanishing Dirichlet traces on the boundary). For this we use the first eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian and the Stokes operator, respectively. Additionally, corresponding problems in domains ${\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$, the 3d-annuli are investigated - for comparison but also to provide limits for ${\cal
  A}\,\to\,0$. In particular, the Green's function of the Laplacian on ${\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$ with vanishing Dirichlet traces on $\partial {\Omega}_{\sigma}^{*}$ is used to show that for ${\sigma}\,\to\,0$ the first eigenvalue here tends to the first eigenvalue of the corresponding problem on the open unit ball. On the other hand, we take advantage of the so-called small-gap limit for ${\cal A}\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux: existence and uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for scalar conservation laws with discontinuous, non-degenerate fluxes. Locally, the fluxes are piecewise smooth across interfaces described by a Heaviside-type discontinuity, with left and right states depending smoothly on both space and the solution variable. The interface is given by a smooth function, and the fluxes vanish at the boundary values of the admissible interval for the solution.
  In addition, we consider the more general case of heterogeneous flux functions with bounded variation in the spatial variable and smooth dependence on the solution variable, again vanishing at the prescribed boundary states. For this setting, we construct a stable semigroup of solutions, thereby establishing a well-posed solution framework.</description>

      <title>Stochastic flows for H\"older drifts and transport/continuity equations with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms generated by SDEs with drift in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$ for any $q \in [2, \infty)$ and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. This result is achieved using a Zvonkin-type transformation for the SDE. As a key intermediate step, well-posedness and optimal regularity for a class of parabolic PDEs related to the transformation is established. Using the existence of a differentiable stochastic flow, we prove well-posedness of $BV_\text{loc}$-solutions of stochastic transport equations and weak solutions of stochastic continuity equations with so-called transport noise and velocity fields in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$. For both equations, solutions may fail to be unique in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Lie module analysis of hydrodynamic-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study nonlinear superpositions of Riemann wave solutions admitted by quasilinear hyperbolic first-order systems of partial differential equations. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie module associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.</description>

      <title>The Kuramoto model on the Sierpinski Gasket II: Twisted states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive CUR Algorithm and its Application to Reduced-Order Modeling of Random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain classes of CUR algorithms, also referred to as cross or pseudoskeleton algorithms, are widely used for low-rank matrix approximation when direct access to all matrix entries is costly. Their key advantage lies in constructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of the target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for reduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where nonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or even full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$. CUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the rank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of accuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability. In this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the intersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We also present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling entries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several nonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds.</description>
