      <title>Unifying Measurement Schemes in 2-D Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two distinct measurement schemes have emerged for the new technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS), complicating the literature. Here, we argue that the 'conventional' measurement scheme derived from nuclear magnetic resonance and its optical-frequency analogues should be favored over the 'alternative' measurement scheme implemented in the majority of 2DTS literature. It is shown that the conventional scheme avoids issues such as overlapping nonlinearities and facilitates physical interpretation of spectra, in contrast to the alternative scheme.</description>

      <title>Analytic Fourier ptychotomography for volumetric refractive index imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) tomography offers label-free, quantitative volumetric imaging but faces limitations due to optical aberrations, limited resolution, and the computational complexity inherent to existing approaches. To overcome these barriers, we propose Analytic Fourier Ptychotomography (AFP), a new computational microscopy technique that analytically reconstructs aberration-free, complex-valued 3D RI distributions without iterative optimization or axial scanning. AFP incorporates a new concept called the finite sample thickness (FST) prior, and analytically solves the inverse scattering problem through three sequential steps: complex-field reconstruction via the Kramers-Kronig relation, linear aberration correction using overlapping spectra, and analytic spectrum extension into the darkfield region. Unlike iterative reconstruction methods, AFP does not require parameter tuning or computationally intensive optimizations, which are often error-prone and non-generalizable. We experimentally demonstrate that AFP significantly enhances image quality and resolution under various aberration conditions across a range of applications. AFP corrected aberrations associated with 25 Zernike modes (with a maximal phase difference of 2.3$\pi$ and maximal Zernike coefficient value of 4), extended the synthetic numerical aperture from 0.41 to 0.99, and provided a two-fold resolution enhancement in all directions. AFP's simplicity and robustness make it an attractive imaging technology for quantitative 3D analysis in biological, microbial ecological, and medical studies.</description>

      <title>Probing Bulk Band Topology from Time Boundary Effect in Synthetic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incident wave at a temporal interface, created by an abrupt change in system parameters, generates time-refracted and time-reflected waves. We find topological characteristics associated with the temporal interface that separates distinct spatial topologies and report a novel bulk-boundary correspondence for the temporal interface. The vanishing of either time refraction or time reflection records a topological phase transition across the temporal interface, and the difference of bulk band topology predicts nontrivial braiding hidden in the time refraction and time reflection coefficients. These findings, which are insensitive to spatial boundary conditions and robust against disorder, are demonstrated in a synthetic frequency lattice with rich topological phases engendered by long-range couplings. Our work reveals the topological aspect of temporal interface and paves the way for using the time boundary effect to probe topological phase transitions and topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Cooperative-Memory Photonic Reservoir using Modulation Nonlinearity: Circumventing the Speed Constraints of Nonlinear Silicon Microring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex dynamics of silicon microring resonators loaded by delayed feedback elements enable high-speed photonic reservoir computing. Implementing feedback is especially challenging when the required delay should match the time scales of silicon's nonlinearities. To increase the computation speed and preclude any need for very long delay lines, we avoid relying on silicon's nonlinearity and merely employ either amplitude or phase modulation along with direct detection. By supplementing its memory with that of the electronic output layer, the proposed photonic reservoir composed of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a microring resonator is predicted to perform computations one order of magnitude faster than those based on silicon's nonlinearity with its speed only limited by the modulation/detection bandwidth. This reservoir performs accurately in NARMA-10, Mackey-Glass, and Santa-Fe prediction tasks, and enables signal equalization in optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Czochralski Growth of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Non-linearity Effect Analysis of Gaussian Pulse Propagation In Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, numerical analysis of nonlinear pulse propagation is carried out. This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist simultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity results in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by inducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion causes the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is discussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental effects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here. Gaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth. Explanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining these steps.</description>

      <title>300 {\mu}s optical cavity storage time and $\mathbf{10^{-7}}$ active RAM cancellation for $\mathbf{10^{-19}}$ laser frequency stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency stabilisation of lasers to optical reference cavities is an established method to achieve state-of-the-art stability. The strengths of this method are the high discriminator coefficient of optical cavities, and the low-noise extraction of the stabilisation signal using modulation techniques. In this Letter we report beyond state-of-the-art performance on both of these fundamentals, unlocking $10^{-19}$ fractional frequency laser stabilisation. We employ a 68 cm long cavity to realise an optical storage time of 300 microseconds, achieving ultrahigh frequency discrimination. We develop a simple and robust scheme to actively cancel residual amplitude modulation (RAM) at the $10^{-7}$ level in an annealed-proton-exchanged lithium-niobate waveguide electro-optic-modulator (EOM).</description>

      <title>Deep photonic reservoir computer for nonlinear equalization of 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic reservoir computer (PRC) is a kind of real-time and adaptive recurrent neural network, where only weights in the readout layer require training. PRC is a promising tool to deal with the crucial issue of nonlinear equalization in optical fiber communications. Here we theoretically show a deep PRC for the nonlinear equalization of coherent signals with the format of 16- level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM). The deep PRC consists of cascading injection-locked Fabry-Perot lasers with optical feedback. Both the in-phase component and the quadrature component of the 16-QAM signals are simultaneously injected into the deep PRC in parallel, based on the wavelength multiplexing of Fabry-Perot lasers. It is demonstrated that the deep PRC exhibits strong capability for the nonlinearity compensation of coherent signals. The Q factor is improved by more than 1 dB for 16-QAM signals with launch powers above 10 dBm, associated with a bit rate of 240 Gbps and a transmission distance of 50 km.</description>

      <title>Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A comparison of single- and two-color schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>

      <title>Micro-Ring Perceptron Sensor for High-Speed, Low-Power Radio-Frequency Signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sensing enables long-range, high-resolution detection for applications such as radar and wireless communication. RF photonic sensing mitigates the bandwidth limitations and high transmission losses of electronic systems by transducing the detected RF signals into broadband optical carriers. However, these sensing systems remain limited by detector noise and Nyquist rate sampling with analog-to-digital converters, particularly under low-power and high-data rate conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the micro-ring perceptron (MiRP) sensor, a physics-inspired AI framework that integrates the micro-ring (MiR) dynamics-based analog processor with a machine-learning-driven digital backend. By embedding the nonlinear optical dynamics of MiRs into an end-to-end architecture, MiRP sensing maps the input signal into a learned feature space for the subsequent digital neural network. The trick is to encode the entire temporal structure of the incoming signal into each output sample in order to enable effectively sub-Nyquist sampling without loss of task-relevant information. Evaluations of three target classification datasets demonstrate the performance advantages of MiRP sensing. For example, on MNIST, MiRP detection achieves $94\pm0.1$\% accuracy at $1/49$ the Nyquist rate at the input RF signal of $1$~ pW, compared to $11\pm0.4$\% for the conventional RF detection method. Thus, our sensor framework provides a robust and efficient solution for the detection of low-power and high-speed signals in real-world sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond Ferroelectric Switching of Intralayer Excitons in Bilayer 3R-MoS2 through Coulomb Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed, non-volatile tunability is critical for advancing reconfigurable photonic devices used in neuromorphic information processing, sensing, and communication. Despite significant progress in developing phase change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, largely impacting their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current infrared sensing devices are based on costly materials with relatively few viable alternatives known. To identify promising candidate materials for infrared photodetection, we have developed a high-throughput screening methodology based on high-accuracy r$^2$SCAN and HSE calculations in density functional theory. Using this method, we identify ten already synthesized materials between the inverse perovskite family, barium silver pnictide family, the alkaline pnictide family, and ZnSnAs$_2$ as top candidates. Among these, ZnSnAs$_2$ emerges as the most promising candidate due to its experimentally verified band gap of 0.74 eV at 0 K, and its cost-effective synthesis through Bridgman growth. BaAgP also shows potential with an HSE-calculated band gap of 0.64 eV, although further experimental validation is required. Lastly, we discover an additional material, Ca$_3$BiP, which has not been previously synthesized, but exhibits a promising optical spectra and a band gap of 0.56 eV. The method applied in this work is sufficiently general to screen wider bandgap materials in high-throughput and now extended to narrow-band gap materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz field effect in a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic-scale thickness and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, open many promising pathways to significantly advance modern electronics. The field effect caused by a strong electric field, typically of MV/cm level, applied perpendicular to the material layers, is a highly effective method for controlling these properties. Field effect allows the regulation of the electron flow in transistor channels, improves the photodetector efficiency and spectral range, and facilitates the exploration of novel exotic quantum phenomena in 2D materials. However, existing approaches to induce the field effect in 2D materials utilize circuit-based electrical gating methods fundamentally limited to microwave response rates. Device-compatible ultrafast, sub-picosecond control needed for modern technology and basic science applications still remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate such an ultrafast field effect in atomically thin MoS2, an archetypal 2D semiconductor, embedded in a hybrid 3D-2D terahertz nanoantenna structure. This nanoantenna efficiently converts an incident terahertz electric field into the vertical ultrafast gating field in MoS2 while simultaneously enhancing it to the required MV/cm level. We observe the terahertz field effect optically as coherent terahertz-induced Stark shift of characteristic exciton resonances in MoS2. Our results enable novel developments in technology and the fundamental science of 2D materials, where the terahertz field effect is crucial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design, fabricate, and characterize fishbone grating couplers for triangular cross-section photonics in silicon carbide compatible with color center integration. The periodic and aperiodic grating coupler designs are optimized to outcouple up to 31% of light in the fundamental TE mode of a triangular waveguide. The devices are fabricated using an ion beam etching process in a 4H-SiC sample implanted with NV center ensembles. The room-temperature transmission and the cryogenic NV center photoluminescence collection measurements indicate experimental grating coupler efficiency of up to 24%. This result provides a scalable method to efficiently extract color center light from SiC quantum nanophotonic devices to free-space optics.</description>

      <title>Self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity</title>

Abstract: Topological edge states typically arise at the boundaries of topologically nontrivial structures or at interfaces between regions with differing topological invariants. When topological systems are extended into the nonlinear regime, linear topological edge states bifurcate into nonlinear counterparts, and topological gap solitons emerge in the bulk of the structures. Despite extensive studies of these two types of nonlinear states, self-induced topological edge states localized at the physical boundaries of originally nontopological structures remain underexplored. Unlike the previously reported self-induced topological transitions driven by nonlinear couplings, which are conceptually straightforward but less common in realistic interacting systems, here we experimentally realize self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity. Leveraging the strong and tunable nonlinearity of electrical circuits, we systematically investigate the localized states in a nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Besides revisiting the nonlinear topological edge states and topological gap solitons, we uncover a novel type of self-induced topological edge states which exhibit the hallmark features of linear topological edge states, including sublattice polarization, phase jumps, and decaying tails that approach zero. A distinctive feature of these states is the boundary-induced power threshold for existence. Our results are broadly applicable and can be readily extended to photonic and cold atomic systems, where onsite nonlinearities naturally arise from interparticle interactions. Our work unveils new opportunities for exploring novel correlated topological states of light and matter, and paves the way for the development of robust photonic devices and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Superadditive Communication with the Green Machine: A Practical Demonstration of Nonlocality without Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving the ultimate Holevo limit of optical communication capacity requires a joint-detection receiver which makes a collective quantum measurement over multiple modulated symbols. Such superadditivity -- a higher communication rate than that achievable by symbol-by-symbol optical detection -- is a special case of the well-known nonlocality without entanglement and has yet to be demonstrated. In this article, we propose and demonstrate a design of joint-detection receivers, the Green Machine, that can achieve superadditivity. We build this receiver and show that its capacity surpasses any symbol-by-symbol receivers in the photon-starved regime with binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK). Our Green Machine receiver can also significantly reduce the transmitter peak power requirement compared with the pulse-position modulation (the conventional modulation format used for deep space laser communication). We further show that the self-referenced phase makes it immune to phase noise, e.g., atmospheric turbulence or platform vibrations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Driven Attractive Interactions in Quantum Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons propagating with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry. This indicates that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonon wave packets across a broad wave vectors range, spanning from 300 to 60 nm. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples, and the signal is still detectable also on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. These findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths across a wide range of solid surfaces. They also establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vectors regime that is well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering techniques.</description>

      <title>Erratic non-Hermitian skin localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel localization phenomenon, termed erratic non-Hermitian skin localization, has been identified in disordered globally-reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices. Unlike conventional non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization, it features macroscopic eigenstate localization at irregular, disorder-dependent positions with sub-exponential decay. Using the Hatano-Nelson model with disordered imaginary gauge fields as a case study, this effect is linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. Finite-size scaling analysis confirms the localized nature of the eigenstates. This discovery challenges conventional wave localization paradigms, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>
