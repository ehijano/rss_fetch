      <title>All-Pass Fractional OPF: A Solver-Friendly, Physics-Preserving Approximation of AC OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/APF-OPF}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.</description>

      <title>An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14613v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stabilizing Neural Controllers for Unknown Switched Nonlinear Systems within Compact Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a neural network based control framework that ensures system safety and input-to-state stability (ISS) for general nonlinear switched systems with unknown dynamics. Leveraging the concept of dwell time, we derive Lyapunov based sufficient conditions under which both safety and ISS of the closed-loop switched system are guaranteed. The feedback controllers and the associated Lyapunov functions are parameterized using neural networks and trained from data collected over a compact state space via deterministic sampling. To provide formal stability guarantees under the learned controllers, we introduce a validity condition based on Lipschitz continuity assumptions, which is embedded directly into the training framework. This ensures that the resulting neural network controllers satisfy provable correctness and stability guarantees beyond the sampled data. As a special case, the proposed framework recovers ISS and safety under arbitrary switching when a common Lyapunov function exists. Simulation results on a representative switched nonlinear system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Calibrated uncertainty quantification for prosumer flexibility aggregation in ancillary service markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Risk-Averse DRO-MILP Methodological Framework for Managing AI/Data Center Demand Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.</description>

      <title>Efficient reformulations of ReLU deep neural networks for surrogate modelling in power system optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.</description>

      <title>Ramping-aware Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation of Distributed Generation with Energy Storage in Power Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power distribution networks are increasingly hosting controllable and flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) that, when aggregated, can provide ancillary support to transmission systems. However, existing aggregation schemes often ignore the ramping constraints of these DERs, which can render them impractical in real deployments. This work proposes a ramping-aware flexibility aggregation scheme, computed at the transmission-distribution boundary, that explicitly accounts for DER ramp limits and yields flexibility envelopes that are provably disaggregable. To further enhance the attainable flexibility region, we introduce a novel pre-ramping strategy, which proactively adjusts resource operating points to enlarge the aggregated flexibility envelope while preserving both network feasibility and disaggregation guarantees. The proposed method demonstrates a 5.2% to 19.2% improvement in flexibility relative to the baseline model, depending on system conditions. We validate the scheme on an IEEE-33 bus distribution system and provide formal proofs showing that both aggregation strategies are disaggregable for all feasible trajectories within the aggregate flexibility envelope.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Optimization Based Multi-objective Dynamic Regulation Scheme for VANET Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a core technology of intelligent transportation systems, vehicular ad-hoc networks support latency-sensitive services such as safety warning and cooperative perception via vehicle-to-everything communications. However, their highly dynamic topology increases average path length, raises latency, and reduces throughput, severely limiting communication performance. Existing topology optimization methods lack capabilities in multi-objective coordination, dynamic adaptation, and global-local synergy. To address this, this paper proposes a two-layer dynamic topology regulation scheme combining local feature aggregation and global adjustment. The scheme constructs a dynamic multi-objective optimization model integrating average path length, end-to-end latency, and network throughput, and achieves multi-index coordination via link adaptability metrics and a dynamic normalization mechanism. it quickly responds to local link changes via feature fusion of local node feature extraction and dynamic neighborhood sensing, and balances optimization accuracy and real-time performance using a dual-mode adaptive solving strategy for global topology adjustment. It reduces network oscillation risks by introducing a performance improvement threshold and a topology validity verification mechanism. Simulation results on real urban road networks via the SUMO platform show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional methods in average path length (stabilizing at ~4 hops), end-to-end latency (remaining ~0.01 s), and network throughput.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy on Affine Manifolds: Geometrically Confined Privacy in Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for differential privacy over affine manifolds and validate its usefulness in the contexts of differentially private cloud-based control and average consensus. We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints. The established theoretical results are illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Contingency Planning for Safety-Critical Autonomous Vehicles: A Review and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contingency planning is the architectural capability that enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to anticipate and mitigate discrete, high-impact hazards, such as sensor outages and adversarial interactions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the field, synthesizing fragmented literature into a unified logic-conditioned hybrid control framework. Within this formalism, we categorize approaches into two distinct paradigms: Reactive Safety, which responds to realized hazards by enforcing safety constraints or executing fail-safe maneuvers; and Proactive Safety, which optimizes for future recourse by branching over potential modal transitions. In addition, we propose a fine-grained taxonomy that partitions the landscape into external contingencies (environmental and interactive hazards) and internal contingencies (system faults). Through a critical comparative analysis, we reveal a fundamental structural divergence: internal faults are predominantly addressed via reactive fail-safe mechanisms, whereas external interaction uncertainties increasingly require proactive branching strategies. Furthermore, we identify a critical methodological divergence: whereas physical hazards are typically managed with formal guarantees, semantic and out-of-distribution anomalies currently rely heavily on empirical validation. We conclude by identifying the open challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical validation, advocating for hybrid architectures and standardized benchmarking to transition contingency planning from formulation to certifiable real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Stealthy bias injection attack detection based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in stochastic linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the design of detection observers against stealthy bias injection attacks in stochastic linear systems under Gaussian noise, considering adversaries that exploit noise and inject crafted bias signals into a subset of sensors in a slow and coordinated manner, thereby achieving malicious objectives while remaining stealthy. To address such attacks, we formulate the observer design as a max-min optimization problem to enhance the detectability of worst-case BIAs, which attain a prescribed attack impact with the least detectability evaluated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. To reduce the computational complexity of the derived non-convex design problem, we consider the detectability of worst-case BIAs at three specific time instants: attack onset, one step after attack occurrence, and the steady state. We prove that the Kalman filter is optimal for maximizing the BIA detectability at the attack onset, regardless of the subset of attacked sensors. For the one-step and steady-state cases, the observer design problems are approximated by bi-convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, more tractable linear matrix inequality relaxations are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed stealth-aware detection framework is demonstrated through an application to a thermal system.</description>

      <title>Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil &amp; gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an instantaneous-frequency (IF) local estimator calculated with the complex Teager-Kaiser energy operator (CTKEO) and the dynamic-signal identity. The contribution is a novel IF expression that makes the envelope-curvature terms explicit, thus correcting the bias that affects conventional estimators used in power systems. The estimator aligns with complex-frequency (CF) kinematics and admits a geometric interpretation (curvature/torsion) without phase unwrapping. Simulations and data-driven examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Stochastic EMS for Optimal 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization formulation to determine optimal operation and procurement plans for achieving a 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) compliance at minimized cost. The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.</description>

      <title>TTCBF: A Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function for High-Order Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety by rendering a prescribed safe set forward invariant. However, standard CBFs are limited to safety constraints with relative degree one, while High-Order CBF (HOCBF) methods address higher relative degree at the cost of introducing a chain of auxiliary functions and multiple class K functions whose tuning scales with the relative degree. In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>VCSEL-based CPO for Scale-Up in A.I. Datacenter. Status and Perspectives</title>

Abstract: The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

      <title>Rethinking On-Device LLM Reasoning: Why Analogical Mapping Outperforms Abstract Thinking for IoT DDoS Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT deployments has intensified cybersecurity threats, notably Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, characterized by increasingly sophisticated patterns. Leveraging Generative AI through On-Device Large Language Models (ODLLMs) provides a viable solution for real-time threat detection at the network edge, though limited computational resources present challenges for smaller ODLLMs. This paper introduces a novel detection framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tailored specifically for IoT edge environments. We systematically evaluate compact ODLLMs, including LLaMA 3.2 (1B, 3B) and Gemma 3 (1B, 4B), using structured prompting and exemplar-driven reasoning strategies. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements with few-shot prompting, achieving macro-average F1 scores as high as 0.85. Our findings highlight the significant advantages of incorporating exemplar-based reasoning, underscoring that CoT and RAG approaches markedly enhance small ODLLMs' capabilities in accurately classifying complex network attacks under stringent resource constraints.</description>

      <title>$\pi$MPC: A Parallel-in-horizon and Construction-free NMPC Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has gained increasing popularity in embedded model predictive control (MPC) due to its code simplicity and pain-free parameter selection. However, existing ADMM solvers either target general quadratic programming (QP) problems or exploit sparse MPC formulations via Riccati recursions, which are inherently sequential and therefore difficult to parallelize for long prediction horizons. This technical note proposes a novel \textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $\pi$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction. Numerical experiments and accompanying code are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Newton Extremum Seeking for Multivariable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Specifying and Verifying RDMA Synchronisation (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows a machine to directly read from and write to the memory of remote machine, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data transfer. Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\text{RDMA}^\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\text{RDMA}^{\text{TSO}}_{\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\text{RDMA}^{\text{WAIT}}_{\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\text{RDMA}^{\text{SC}}_{\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures. Our libraries are built to be compatible with an existing set of high-performance libraries called LOCO, which ensures compositionality and verifiability.</description>

      <title>Blended Dynamics and Emergence in Open Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Practical prescribed-time prescribed performance control with asymptotic convergence -- A vanishing sigma-modification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method capable of ensuring practical prescribed-time control with guaranteed performance for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of time-varying parametric and dynamic uncertainties, and uncertain control coefficients. Our design consists of two key steps. First, we construct a performance-rate function that freezes at and after a user-specified time T, playing a crucial role in achieving desired precision within prescribed time T and dealing with unmodeled dynamics. Next, based on this function and a sigma-modification strategy in which the leakage term starts to vanish at t &gt; T, we develop an adaptive dynamic surface control framework to reduce control complexity, deal with uncertainties, ensure prescribed performance, practical prescribed-time convergence to a specific region, and ultimately achieve asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Rank-one Riemannian Subspace Descent for Nonlinear Matrix Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a rank-one Riemannian subspace descent algorithm for computing symmetric positive definite (SPD) solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising in control theory, dynamic programming, and stochastic filtering. For solution matrices of size $n\times n$, standard approaches for dense matrix equations typically incur $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost per-iteration, while the efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ methods either rely on sparsity or low-rank solutions, or have iteration counts that scale poorly. The proposed method entails updating along the dominant eigen-component of a transformed Riemannian gradient, identified using at most $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ power iterations. The update structure also enables exact step-size selection in many cases at minimal additional cost. For objectives defined as compositions of standard matrix operations, each iteration can be implemented using only matrix--vector products, yielding $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ arithmetic cost. We prove an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ iteration bound under standard smoothness assumptions, with improved bounds under geodesic strong convexity. Numerical experiments on large-scale CARE, DARE, and other nonlinear matrix equations show that the proposed algorithm solves instances (up to $n=10{,}000$ in our tests) for which the compared solvers, including MATLAB's \texttt{icare}, structure-preserving doubling, and subspace-descent baselines fail to return a solution. These results demonstrate that rank-one manifold updates provide a practical approach for high-dimensional and dense SPD-constrained matrix equations.

      <title>The Responsibility Vacuum: Organizational Failure in Scaled Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.
  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.
  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.
  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.
  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) often suffer from limited parallel performance, whereas thread monitoring in Linux-based systems remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a satellite flight software system design based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), which utilizes its reliable built-in publish-subscribe messaging mechanism to facilitate inter-application communication. In response to the complex functional demands of modern small satellites, the proposed design integrates both hardware and software architectures, along with system scheduling and error-correction strategies. This integration supports efficient parallel data processing, enhances system reliability, and shortens the development cycle through code reuse. The system was rigorously evaluated through comprehensive tests covering time delay, system management, fault tolerance, and maintenance procedures. Experimental results confirm the system's effectiveness in telemetry, remote control, integration of new features, and autonomous error recovery. The findings underscore the high reliability and maintainability of the ROS-based satellite flight software, offering a valuable reference for the rapid development of high-performance small satellite systems.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the exact characterization of the covariance dynamics related to linear discrete-time systems subject to both additive and parametric stochastic uncertainties that are potentially unbounded. Using this characterization, the problem of control design for state covariance dynamics is addressed, providing conditions that are conservative yet more tractable compared to standard necessary and sufficient ones for the same class of systems. Numerical results assess this new characterization by comparing it to the empirical covariance and illustrate the control design problem.</description>

      <title>Two-Level Distributed Interference Management for Large-Scale HAPS-Empowered vHetNets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation wireless networks (xG). Integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, creating HAPS-empowered vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), significantly improves coverage and capacity and supports emerging novel use cases. In HAPS-empowered vHetNets, HAPS and terrestrial network tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, harmonized spectrum vHetNets face major challenges, including severe co-channel interference and scalability in large-scale deployments. To address the first challenge, we adopt a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network architecture in which users are simultaneously served by multiple base stations using beamforming. However, beamforming weight design leads to a nonconvex, high-dimensional optimization problem, highlighting the scalability challenge. To address this second challenge, we develop a two-level distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm. This algorithm combines the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) with a three-block ADMM framework. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvements achieved by integrating HAPS with standalone terrestrial networks, as well as the reduced complexity and signaling overhead of the distributed algorithm compared to centralized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Grid Connections Providing Fast-Frequency Response: System Integration Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</description>

      <title>Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE.
  Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures.
  Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Network Slicing Resource Management in Uplink User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation and UE-access point (AP) association to maximize weighted sum-rate while satisfying heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink of a network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. To address this challenge, it is decomposed into two sub-problems, each solved by a computationally efficient heuristic scheme, and jointly optimized through an alternating optimization framework. We then propose (i) a bandwidth allocation scheme that balances UE priority, spectral efficiency, and minimum bandwidth demand under limited resources to ensure fair QoS distribution, and (ii) a priority-based UE-AP association assignment approach that balances UE service quality with system capacity constraints. Together, these approaches provide a practical and computationally efficient solution for resource-constrained network slicing scenarios, where QoS feasibility is often violated under dense deployments and limited bandwidth, necessitating graceful degradation and fair QoS preservation rather than solely maximizing the aggregate sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 52% higher weighted sum-rate, 140% and 58% higher QoS success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, while reducing runtime by up to 97% compared to the considered benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from an interior point solver-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Research on Adaptive Inertial Control in Synchronization Systems: Based on Variational Optimization Methods and Their Applications in the Stability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Co-Buchi Barrier Certificates for Discrete-time Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barrier certificates provide functional overapproximations for the reachable set of dynamical systems and provide inductive guarantees on the safe evolution of the system. In automata-theoretic verification, a key query is to determine whether the system visits a given predicate over the states finitely often, typically resulting from the complement of the traditional Buchi acceptance condition. This paper proposes a barrier certificate approach to answer such queries by developing a notion of co-Buchi barrier certificates (CBBCs) that generalize classic barrier certificates to ensure that the traces of a system visit a given predicate a fixed number of times. Our notion of CBBC is inspired from bounded synthesis paradigm to LTL realizability, where the LTL specifications are converted to safety automata via universal co-Buchi automata with a bound on final state visitations provided as a hyperparameter. Our application of CBBCs in verification is analogous: we fix a bound and search for a suitable barrier certificate, increasing the bound if no suitable function can be found. We then use these CBBCs to verify our system against properties specified by co-Buchi automata and demonstrate their effectiveness via some case studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.</description>
