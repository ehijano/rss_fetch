      <description>arXiv:2405.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define variational properties for dynamical systems with subexponential complexity, and study these properties in certain specific examples. By computing the value of slow entropy directly, we show that Sturmian systems are not variational, while a class of interval exchange transformations are variational</description>

      <title>Nearly-circular periodic solutions of perturbed relativistic Kepler problems: the fixed-period and the fixed-energy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the existence of periodic solutions of a perturbed relativistic Kepler problem of the type \begin{equation*} \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left(\frac{m\dot{x}}{\sqrt{1-|\dot{x}|^{2}/c^{2}}}\right) = -\alpha\frac{x}{|x|^{3}} + \varepsilon \, \nabla_{x} U(t,x), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}, \end{equation*} with $d=2$ or $d=3$, bifurcating, for $\varepsilon$ small enough, from the set of circular solutions of the unperturbed system. Both the case of the fixed-period problem (assuming that $U$ is $T$-periodic in time) and the case of the fixed-energy problem (assuming that $U$ is independent of time) are considered.</description>

      <title>Results on Dynamics of Bungee set of Composite Entire Functions in the Eremenko-Lyubich Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discussed the dynamics of composite entire functions in terms of relationship between Bungee set and repelling periodic points(to be denoted by $RP$. We have established relation between the dynamics of composite function and the functions taken for composition. We showed that the union of their Bungee sets contains Bungee set of the composite function. We also showed that $RP$ set of composite functions contains the $ RP$ set of functions used for the composition. We have mostly dealt with the functions of class $\mathcal{B}$ which are also permutable. These results hold true when we have a composite function in which one function is a periodic translation of another.</description>

      <title>A refined saturation theorem for polynomials and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a dynamical system $(X,T)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and distinct non-constant integral polynomials $p_1,\ldots, p_d$ vanishing at $0$, the notion of regionally proximal relation along $C=\{p_1,\ldots,p_d\}$ (denoted by $RP_C^{[d]}(X,T)$) is introduced.
  It turns out that for a minimal system, $RP_C^{[d]}(X,T)=\Delta$ implies that $X$ is an almost one-to-one extension of $X_k$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$ only depending on a set of finite polynomials associated with $C$ and has zero entropy, where $X_k$ is the maximal $k$-step pro-nilfactor of $X$.
  Particularly, when $C$ is a collection of linear polynomials, it is proved that $RP_C^{[d]}(X,T)=\Delta$ implies $(X,T)$ is a $d$-step pro-nilsystem, which answers negatively a conjecture in \cite{5p}. The results are obtained by proving a refined saturation theorem for polynomials.</description>

      <title>All, most, some? On diffeomorphisms of the interval that are distorted and/or conjugate to powers of themselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of conjugating a diffeomorphism of the interval to (positive) powers of itself. Although this is always possible for homeomorphisms, the smooth setting is rather interesting. Besides the obvious obstruction given by hyperbolic fixed points, several other aspects need to be considered. As concrete results we show that, in class $C^1$, if we restrict to the (closed) subset of diffeomorphisms having only parabolic fixed points, then the set of diffeomorphisms that are conjugate to their powers is dense, but its complement is generic. In higher regularity, however, the complementary set contains an open and dense set. The text is complemented with several remarks and results concerning distortion elements of the group of diffeomorphisms of the interval in several regularities.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing and superpolynomial equidistribution for torus extensions of hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study error estimates on the equidistribution of holonomies around closed orbits and mixing rates for $\mathbb{T}^{d}$-extensions of hyperbolic flows. Given three closed orbits with their holonomies, we can relate them to a point in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We prove that the extension flow enjoys rapid mixing as well as superpolynomial equidistribution, if the associated point is an inhomogeneously Diophantine number. Additionally, we also provide examples of frame flows that meet this criterion.</description>

      <title>Generic behavior of differentially positive systems on a globally orderable Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially positive systems are the nonlinear systems whose linearization along trajectories preserves a cone field on a smooth Riemannian manifold. One of the embryonic forms for cone fields in reality is originated from the general relativity. By utilizing the Perron-Frobenius vector fields and the $\Gamma$-invariance of cone fields, we show that generic (i.e.,``almost all" in the topological sense) orbits are convergent to certain single equilibrium. This solved a reduced version of Forni-Sepulchre's conjecture in 2016 for globally orderable manifolds.</description>

      <title>On ergodic properties of geodesic flows on uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on ergodic properties of the geodesic flow on a $C^\infty$ uniform visibility manifold $M$ without conjugate points. If $M$ is a closed surface of genus at least two without conjugate points, and with continuous Green bundles and bounded asymptote, we study the geometric properties of singular geodesics and show that if all singular geodesics are closed, then there are at most finitely many isolated singular closed geodesics and finitely many generalized strips. In particular, the geodesic flow is ergodic with respect to Liouville measure under the above assumption.
  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed uniform visibility manifold without conjugate points and $X$ its universal cover. Under the entropy gap assumption, the geodesic flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy (MME for short) by \cite[Theorem 1.2]{MR}. We develop a Patterson-Sullivan construction of this unique MME and show that it has local product structure, is fully supported, and has the Bernoulli property.
  If we assume further that $M$ has continuous Green bundles and the geodesic flow has a hyperbolic periodic point, using the nonuniform hyperbolic structure on an open dense subset and the symbolic approach developed in \cite{LP}, we show that for any H\"{o}lder continuous function, the equilibrium state is unique under the pressure gap condition.
  Under the same conditions above, we apply the mixing properties of the MME to count the number of free-homotopy classes containing a closed geodesic, as well as the volume asymptotics of Riemannian balls in the universal cover. We then obtain some rigidity results involving the Margulis function.
  Finally, for a uniform visibility manifold $M=X/\Gamma$ (not necessarily compact) without conjugate points, we show that if $\Gamma$ is non-elementary and contains an expansive isometry, then the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy holds.</description>

      <title>Global stability and period-doubling bifurcations of a discrete Kolmogorov predator-prey model with Ricker-type prey growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of a discrete Kolmogorov predator-prey model with Ricker-type prey growth. We give the sufficient and necessary condition to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the positive fixed point. Using the center manifold theory, we prove that the period-doubling bifurcations can occur at the positive fixed point. Furthermore, our numerical simulations reveal that the model can exhibit cascades of period-doubling bifurcations leading to chaos, which is a significant difference from the behavior of continuous predator-prey models. Despite the complexities of the model dynamics, we are able to provide a criterion for the global stability of the positive fixed point by using a geometric analysis of the nullclines.</description>

      <title>Shrinking targets and recurrent behaviour for forward compositions of inner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp results about recurrent behaviour of orbits of forward compositions of inner functions, inspired by fundamental results about iterates of inner functions, and give examples to illustrate behaviours that cannot occur in the simpler case of iteration.
  A result of Fern\'andez, Meli\'an and Pestana gives a precise version of the classical Poincar\'e recurrence theorem for iterates of the boundary extension of an inner function that fixes~0. We generalise this to forward composition sequences $F_n=f_n\circ \dots\circ f_1,$ $n\in \mathbb{N},$ where $f_n$ are inner functions that fix~0, giving conditions on the contraction of $(F_n)$ so that the radial boundary extension $F_n$ hits any shrinking target of arcs $(I_n)$ of a given size.
  Next, Aaronson, and also Doering and Ma\~n\'e, gave a remarkable dichotomy for iterates of any inner function, showing that the behaviour of the boundary extension is of two entirely different types, depending on the size of the sequence $(|f^n(0)|)$. In earlier work, we showed that one part of this dichotomy holds in the non-autonomous setting of forward compositions.
  It turns out that this dichotomy is closely related to the result of Fern\'andez, Meli\'an and Pestana, and here we show that a version of the second part of the dichotomy holds in the non-autonomous setting provided we impose a condition on the contraction of $(F_n)$ in relation to the size of the sequence $(|F_n(0)|)$. The techniques we use include a strong version of the second Borel--Cantelli lemma and strong mixing results of Pommerenke for contracting sequences of inner functions. We give examples to show that the contraction conditions that we need to impose in the non-autonomous setting are best possible.</description>

      <title>Variety of Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, some variation of the concept of attractor are presented, called attractor, physical attractor and proper attractor. As a result, it is proved that the phase space of a topologically exact system is a proper attractor for its inverse and vice versa.
  Furthermore, in definition of physical attractor, one face with systems in which their phase space attracts all of the open non-empty sets. It is established that a system is topologically mixing if and only if its phase space is physical attractor.
  Finally, by appealing to IFSs, we demonstrate some classes of non-trivial topologically mixing and topologically exact IFSs.</description>

      <title>The amount of nonhyperbolicity for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amount of nonhyperbolicity within a broad class of (nonhyperbolic) partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with a one-dimensional center. For that, we focus on the center Lyapunov exponent and the entropy of its level sets. We show that these entropies vary continuously and can be expressed in terms of restricted variational principles. In this study, no dynamical coherence is required.
  Of particular interest is the case where the exponent is zero. To study this level set, we construct a compact set foliated by curves tangent to the central direction. Within this set, the entropy attains the maximal possible (and positive) value. Moreover, finite-time Lyapunov exponents converge uniformly to zero. In this construction, we introduce a mechanism to concatenate center curves.
  The class studied consists of those robustly transitive diffeomorphisms that have a pair of blender-horseshoes with different types of hyperbolicity and possess minimal strong stable and unstable foliations. This classes includes flow-type and circle-fibered diffeomorphisms as well as some derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms. It also includes the so-called anomalous examples which are dynamically incoherent.</description>

      <title>Classifying multiply connected wandering domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the internal dynamics of multiply connected wandering domains of meromorphic functions. We do so by considering the sequence of injectivity radii along the orbit of a base point, together with the hyperbolic distortions along the same orbit. The latter sequence had been previously used in this context; the former introduces geometric information about the shape of the wandering domains that interacts with the dynamic information given by the hyperbolic distortions. Using this idea, we complete the description of the internal dynamics of any wandering domain of a meromorphic function, and also unify previous approaches to the question. We conclude that the internal dynamics of a wandering domain, from the point of view of hyperbolic geometry, can be classified into six different types. Five of these types are realised by wandering domains of entire functions, while the sixth can only arise for meromorphic functions: a locally but not globally eventually isometric wandering domain. We construct a meromorphic function with such a domain, demonstrating that this new phenomenon does in fact occur. Our results show that, on a local level, the dynamics of multiply connected wandering domains of meromorphic functions is similar to those of entire functions, although new global phenomena can arise for non-entire functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic two-patch epidemic model with nonlinear recidivism to investigate infectious disease dynamics in heterogeneous populations. Extending a deterministic framework, we introduce stochasticity to account for random transmission, recovery, and inter-patch movement fluctuations. We showcase the interplay between local dynamics and migration effects on disease persistence using Monte Carlo simulations and three stochastic approximations-discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), Poisson, and stochastic differential equations (SDE). Our analysis shows that stochastic effects can cause extinction events and oscillations near critical thresholds like the basic reproduction number, R0, phenomena absent in deterministic models. Numerical simulations highlight source-sink dynamics, where one patch is a persistent infection source while the other experiences intermittent outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Contrasting chaotic and stochastic forcing: tipping windows and attractor crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions or tipping points where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing causes the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. If this noise corresponds to unresolved chaotic forcing, there is a limit such that this can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the statistics of large deviations determine the transitions. Away from this limit it makes sense to consider tipping in the presence of chaotic rather than stochastic forcing. In general we argue that close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen, in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be seen as a boundary crisis/non-autonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional case of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlight the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If a parameter is changing slowly we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>On Mirzakhani's twist torus conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a conjecture of Mirzakhani about the statistical behavior of certain expanding families of ``twist tori'' in the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces, showing that they equidistribute to a certain Lebesgue-class measure along almost all sequences. We also identify a number of other expanding families of twist tori whose limiting distributions are mutually singular to Lebesgue.</description>

      <title>Zimmer's conjecture for non-uniform lattices: escape of mass and growth of cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish finiteness of low-dimensional actions of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and establish Zimmer's conjecture for many such groups. This builds on previous work of the authors handling the case of actions by cocompact lattices and of actions by $\Sl(n,\Z)$. While the results are not sharp in all cases, they do dramatically improve all known results. The key difficulty overcome in this paper concerns escape of mass when taking limits of sequences of measures. Due to a need to control Lyapunov exponents for unbounded cocycles when taking such limits, quantitative controls on the concentration of mass at infinity are need and novel techniques are introduced to avoid ``escape of Lyapunov exponent."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a continuous eigenfunction for the transfer operator corresponding to pair potentials that satisfy a square summability condition, when the inverse temperature is subcritical. As a corollary we obtain a continuous eigenfunction for the classical Dyson model, with interactions $\J(k)=\beta \, k^{-\alpha}$, $k\ge1$, in the whole subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ for which the parameter $\alpha$ is greater than $3/2$.</description>

      <title>Equivariant embedding of finite-dimensional dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an equivariant version of the classical Menger-Nobeling theorem regarding topological embeddings: Whenever a group $G$ acts on a finite-dimensional compact metric space $X$, a generic continuous equivariant function from $X$ into $([0,1]^r)^G$ is a topological embedding, provided that for every positive integer $N$ the space of points in $X$ with orbit size at most $N$ has topological dimension strictly less than $\frac{rN}{2}$. We emphasize that the result imposes no restrictions whatsoever on the acting group $G$ (beyond the existence of an action on a finite-dimensional space). Moreover, if $G$ is finitely generated then there exists a finite subset $F\subset G$ so that for a generic continuous map $h:X\to [0,1]^{r}$, the map $h^{F}:X\to ([0,1]^{r})^{F}$ given by $x\mapsto (f(gx))_{g\in F}$ is an embedding. This constitutes a generalization of the Takens delay embedding theorem into the topological category.</description>

      <title>Arnold diffusion for an a priori unstable Hamiltonian system with 3 $+$ 1/2 degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we apply the geometrical mechanism of diffusion in an \emph{a priori} unstable Hamiltonian system with 3 $+$ 1/2 degrees of freedom. This mechanism consists of combining iterations of the \emph{inner} and \emph{outer} dynamics associated to a \emph{Normallly Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold} (NHIM), to construct diffusing \emph{pseudo-orbits} and subsequently apply shadowing results to prove the existence of diffusing orbits of the system.
  In addition to proving the existence of diffusion for a wide range of the parameters of the system, an important part of our study focuses on the search for \emph{Highways}, a particular family of orbits of the outer map (the so-called \emph{scattering} map), whose existence is sufficient to ensure a very large drift of the action variables, with a diffusion time near them that agrees with the optimal estimates in the literature. Moreover, this optimal diffusion time is calculated, with an explicit calculation of the constants involved. All these properties are proved by analytical methods and, where necessary, supplemented by numerical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetic properties of the multiplier polynomials for certain $1$-parameter families of polynomials. In particular, we prove integrality theorems of multiplier polynomials for $z^d+c$, $(z-c)z^d + c$ and $z^{d+1}+cz$. As a corollary, we obtain the uniform upper bound of the naive height of parabolic parameters of unicritical polynomials. Moreover, we determined the quadratic parabolic parameters for $z^2 + c$. We also conditionally list parabolic parameters for $z^2 + c$ of fixed degrees.</description>

      <title>Note on existence of physical measures for systems with mixed central behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of physical measures for $C^{\infty}$ smooth instances of certain partially hyperbolic dynamics, both continuous and discrete, exhibiting mixed behavior (positive and negative Lyapunov exponents) along the central non-uniformly hyperbolic multidimensional invariant direction, as a consequence of assuming the existence of certain types of ''regular points'' on positive volume subsets. This includes the $C^3$ robust class of multidimensional non-hyperbolic attractors obtained by Viana, and the $C^1$ robust classes of $3$-sectionally hyperbolic wild strange attractors presented by Shilnikov and Turaev.</description>

      <title>The Artin-Mazur zeta function for interval maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the Artin-Mazur zeta function for piecewise monotone functions acting on a compact interval of real numbers. In the case of unimodal maps, Milnor and Thurston gave a characterization for the rationality of the Artin-Mazur zeta function in terms of the orbit of the unique turning point. We show that for multimodal maps, the previous characterization does not hold.</description>

      <title>An Inner Product on Adelic Measures: With Applications to the Arakelov-Zhang Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an inner product on a vector space of adelic measures over a number field. We find that the norm induced by this inner product governs weak convergence at each place of $K$. The canonical adelic measure associated to a rational map is in this vector space, and the square of the norm of the difference of two such adelic measures is the Arakelov-Zhang pairing from arithmetic dynamics. We prove a sharp lower bound on the norm of adelic measures with points of small adelic height. We find that the norm of a canonical adelic measure associated to a rational map is commensurate with the Arakelov height on the space of rational functions with fixed degree. As a consequence, the Arakelov-Zhang pairing of two rational maps $f$ and $g$ can be bounded from below as a function of $g$.</description>

      <title>Generic mean curvature flows with cylindrical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamics of mean curvature flow as it approaches a cylindrical singularity. We reveal the mechanism for the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities in terms of the normal form of the asymptotic expansion of the rescaled mean curvature flow and formulate the notion of nondegeneracy of a cylindrical singularity.
  Our findings show that, generically, such a non-degenerate singularity is robust and isolated. In the presence of more complicated singularity sets such as in the example of a marriage ring, we demonstrate how to make the first-time singularity set a singleton by an arbitrarily small initial perturbation. These discoveries have implications for the level set flows' generic low regularity and the type-I nature of generic rotational MCFs. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of a ``firecracker'' type singularity and its significance in studying the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities. The research combines techniques and concepts from geometric flows, dynamical systems, and semilinear heat equations.</description>

Abstract: We show that discrete stationary random subgroups of isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces have full limit sets as well as critical exponents bounded from below. This information is used to answer a question of Gelander and show that a rank one locally symmetric space for which the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the same as that of its universal cover has unbounded injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Almost periodic and Asymptotically Almost Periodic Navier-Stokes flows on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic (AP-) and asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies negative and bounded conditions on Ricci curvature tensor. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of AP- and AAP- mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the ones for Navier-Stokes equations obtained in \cite{Xuan2022}.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling and Control of Medical Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vision of personalized medicine is to identify interventions that maintain or restore a person's health based on their individual biology. Medical digital twins, computational models that integrate a wide range of health-related data about a person and can be dynamically updated, are a key technology that can help guide medical decisions. Such medical digital twin models can be high-dimensional, multi-scale, and stochastic. To be practical for healthcare applications, they often need to be simplified into low-dimensional surrogate models that can be used for the optimal design of interventions. This paper introduces surrogate modeling algorithms for the purpose of optimal control applications. As a use case, we focus on agent-based models (ABMs), a common model type in biomedicine for which there are no readily available optimal control algorithms. By deriving surrogate models that are based on systems of ordinary differential equations, we show how optimal control methods can be employed to compute effective interventions, which can then be lifted back to a given ABM. The relevance of the methods introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a twist condition, inspired by the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem on area-preserving maps of the annulus, which applies to asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of linear phase space. When an asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, non-degenerate and unitary at infinity, satisfies this twist condition, we show that it has infinitely many periodic points.</description>

Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>
