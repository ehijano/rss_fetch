      <title>Can Moons Exist around the Habitable-zone Planet K2-18b?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-18b closely orbits a nearby M3 dwarf within its habitable zone, where this planet could be either a super-Earth or a mini-Neptune. Recent studies using transit spectroscopy suggest that it is Hycean in nature, but this classification is currently controversial. We use the N-body integrator rebound and its extension library reboundx to investigate the possibility of exomoons around K2-18b. Due to tidal interactions that induce outward migration, we find that any moons would be extremely unlikely. If formed, their lifetimes would be relatively short, not exceeding 10 Myr assuming Earth-like or Neptune-like tidal parameters for K2-18b. Recent studies estimate the stellar (and system) lifetime as 3 Gyr, which is significantly longer than the tidal migration timescale. We show that exomoons are unlikely to survive around K2-18b due to rapid tidal-driven migration, casting doubt on moon-based habitability scenarios for short-period M-dwarf planets in general.</description>

      <title>A young gas giant and hidden substructures in a protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely challenging. In contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet-disk interactions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class II) disk observed at 0.9-1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The nearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its advanced age (7-10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its apparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data of MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of a companion. Here we present ALMA 3 mm observations of the system with comparable high spatial resolution to previous 1.3 mm data. The new observations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity (&lt;3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations narrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1-3 au, and hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the observed cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect but compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using Gaia astrometry. MP Mus is the first system in which undetected substructures are revealed thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths, suggesting that rings and gaps are even more abundant than what is currently believed.</description>

      <title>Chemical transformation of CO in evolving protoplanetary discs across stellar masses: a route to C-rich inner regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich MIR spectra indicative of C/O&gt;1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs around higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario proposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas from the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most ~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this transport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving inner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of molecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key reaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size, ionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due to sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich species (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O&gt;1, separating C and O is key, hence the liberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this chemistry and needs rates &gt;~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical evolution within a disc lifetime. However, &lt;~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure that C/O stays &lt;1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually higher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O significantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction with gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon production around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization rates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher ionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales alone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the CH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the inner disc.</description>

      <title>exoALMA. XVIII. Interpreting large scale kinematic structures as moderate warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps ($\sim 0.5-2^\circ$) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber $m = 1$. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with $\sim 10$ K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disc and outer disc kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Volatile enrichment in low-mass planets: Signatures of past planetary disruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Tidal disruption and engulfment events around main-sequence stars, such as the luminous red nova ZTF SLRN-2020 (a candidate planetary-engulfment event), reveal the destruction of close-in giant planets. While current observations focus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of the volatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly understood.
  Aims: We investigate whether the H/He-rich gas expelled from the disrupted planet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be gravitationally captured by an outer low-mass planet (a volatile-enriched planet, or VEP), potentially forming a transient atmosphere and producing detectable volatile contamination.
  Methods: We model the outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, complemented by analytical estimates of volatile observability and atmospheric escape. We assess the efficiency of gas capture by outer planets and the survival timescales of the resulting secondary atmospheres under high-energy stellar irradiation.
  Results: Our simulations show that volatile-rich gas can form a VEP. The resulting envelopes can contain between 1e-10 and 1e-6 Earth masses, up to the mass of Earth's atmosphere, for Earth-like planets, yielding transit depths of tens to several hundred ppm. Such signatures may persist for 1 to 100 million years, depending on planetary mass, orbit, and stellar activity.
  Conclusions: This scenario offers a viable pathway to form volatile-rich atmospheres in evolved low-mass planets. When accompanied by dynamical signatures such as eccentric orbits, these chemical anomalies may trace past planetary disruption. This framework may help interpret the atmospheric and orbital properties of systems like TOI-421b and WASP-107b, shedding new light on the late-stage evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>ExoGemS The Effect of Offsets from True Orbital Parameters on Exoplanet High-Resolution Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) plays a crucial role in characterizing exoplanet atmospheres, revealing detailed information about their chemical composition, temperatures, and dynamics. However, inaccuracies in orbital parameters can affect the result of HRS analyses. In this paper, we simulated HRS observations of an exoplanet's transit to model the effects of an offset in transit midpoint or eccentricity on the resulting spectra. We derived analytical equations to relate an offset in transit midpoint or eccentricity to shifted velocities, and compared it with velocities measured from simulated HRS observations. Additionally, we compared velocity shifts in the spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b using previously reported and newly measured transit times. We found that transit midpoint offsets on the order of minutes, combined with eccentricity offsets of approximately $0.1$, lead to significant shifts in velocities, yielding measurements on the order of several kilometers per second. Thus, such uncertainties could conflate derived wind measurements.</description>

      <title>Palomar and Apache Point Spectrophotometry of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On July 1st 2025 the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered, with an eccentricity of $e=6.15 \pm 0.01$ and perihelion of $q=1.357\pm0.001$ au. We report our initial visible to near-infrared (420-1000 nm) spectrophotometry of 3I/ATLAS using both the Palomar 200 inch telescope and Apache Point Observatory. We measure 3I/ATLAS to have a red spectral slope of 19 %/100 nm in the 420-700 nm range, and a more neutral 6 %/100 nm slope over 700-1000 nm. We detect no notable emission features such as from C$_2$.</description>

      <title>Why Wide Jupiter-Mass Binary-Objects Cannot Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of $N_{\rm pp} = 40$ Jupiter-mass binary objects (JuMBOs) alongside $N_{\rm p} = 500$ free-floating Jupiter-mass objects (JMOs) in the Trapezium cluster's central portion raises questions about their origin \cite{2023arXiv231001231P}. \citet{2024NatAs...8..756W} argue that the rate at which two planets orbiting the same star are stripped by a close encounter can explain about half the observed JuMBOs in the Trapezium cluster. Although, their cross-section calculations agree with our own \citep{2024ScPA....3....1P}, one cannot extrapolate their results into clustered environments because it ignores the dissociation of JuMBOs due to subsequent encounters in the clustered environment. The inability of forming JuMBOs via the proposed scenario either calls for another formation mechanism, or the observed JuMBOs require thorough confirmation.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Near-Discovery Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar Objects are comets and asteroids that formed around other stars but were ejected before they could accrete into exoplanets. They therefore represent a rare opportunity to compare the building blocks of planets in the Solar System to those in other stellar systems. The third Interstellar Object, 3I/ATLAS, is the newest, brightest, potentially largest, and fastest member of this population. We report observations of 3I/ATLAS taken on 2025 July 3 and 4 with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility just days after its discovery. In r'-band imaging with 'Opihi, we see no obvious lightcurve variability and derive a g'-i' color of 1.06+/-0.11 which is consistent in spectral slope to recent work by D.Z. Seligman et al. (2025) and C. Opitom (2025). We obtained the first near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectrum of 3I/ATLAS with SpeX. The visible color and NIR spectrum show a linear, red visible slope, a somewhat less red slope between 0.7 and 1.1 $\mu{m}$, and a neutral or slightly blue slope at longer wavelengths. Challenges in modeling the reflectivity of 3I may indicate that this comet has a complex grain size distribution, grain compositions unlike Solar system comets, or both. Like 2I/Borisov, there are no obvious signatures of water ice in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. Observations closer to perihelion will help elucidate whether 3I has less water than anticipated or whether the Interstellar Objects might retain and release their ices somewhat differently than Solar System comets do.</description>

      <title>Panchromatic characterization of the Y0 brown dwarf WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 using JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold brown dwarf atmospheres are good training grounds for analyzing temperate giant planets. WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (WISE 1738) is an isolated Y0 brown dwarf with a temperature between 350-400 K, at the T-Y transition. While its near-infrared spectrum has been studied, bulk properties and chemistry remain uncertain. We analyze new JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectra (5-18 micron), combined with near-infrared spectra (0.98-2.2 micron) from HST/WFC3 and Gemini/GNIRS, to better constrain WISE 1738's atmosphere and physical parameters. We use Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a cloud-free petitRADTRANS model and evaluate results using posterior checks, coverage, and L-C2ST diagnostics. Our retrieval confirms previous constraints on H2O, CH4, and NH3, and for the first time constrains CO, CO2, and 15NH3. We find evidence of disequilibrium chemistry through CO and CO2 abundances not expected under equilibrium. Estimated properties are temperature 402 (+12,-9) K, log g 4.43 (+0.26,-0.34) cm/s2, mass 13 (+11,-7) M_Jup, radius 1.14 (+0.03,-0.03) R_Jup, and bolometric luminosity -6.52 (+0.05,-0.04) log L/L_sun. Evolutionary models suggest an age between 1 and 4 Gyr, consistent with a 6-hour rotation. We place an upper bound on 15NH3, implying a 3-sigma lower limit on the 14N/15N ratio of 275. We also derive a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.39,-0.31) and metallicity of 0.34 (+0.12,-0.11), without accounting for oxygen sequestration.</description>

      <title>SAMPLE -- Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence -- A Method of Collection of Stratospheric Samples Using Balloon-Borne Payload System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.</description>

      <title>Impacts and Ejecta in Natural Granular Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With laboratory experiments we investigate the ejecta of low-velocity (~m/s) impacts into multi-scale granular media and compare them against ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Impacts are into a 50 cm diameter galvanized washtub filled with fine sand that has larger diameter gravel buried below the surface is filmed with two high-speed cameras. The resulting ejecta curtain consists mainly of fine sand, and has a complex asymmetric structure that depends on the location and interaction of the ejecta with the larger gravel grains mixed into the sand. To characterize the highly heterogeneous ejecta curtain we combine three analysis techniques: Particle tracking measures the ejecta velocities and ejecta angles best in low density regions, while particle image velocimetry (PIV) elucidates average motion in dense regions, and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which captures directions of motion against a patterned background. We find significant asymmetries in the multi-scale ejecta's velocity distributions and ejection angles compared to the symmetry seen in the ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Our experiments show that larger grains under the surface impede and direct ejecta along preferential paths during the impact process.</description>

      <title>Can plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a process that converts magnetic energy into plasma energy by changing the magnetic field line topology. The outstanding question is why the reconnection rate is $\mathcal{O}(0.01 - 0.1)$ in many astrophysical phenomena, for example solar flares and terrestrial substorms. Previous studies have shown two ideas of Hall reconnection and plasmoid instability. However, there is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection. In this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \rewrite{2D antiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD simulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can indeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of secondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge using realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we find that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary plasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated reconnection. Although our simulation $\mathcal{O}(100\lambda_i)$ box is not large enough to discuss astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares, it can reflect a relatively small plasma system such as the Earth's magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Activity in the Largest Known Oort Cloud Comet: ALMA Imaging of C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) at 16.6 au from the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) carried out on UT 2024 March 8 and 17 at a heliocentric distance ($r_{\mathrm{H}}$) of 16.6 au using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The CO ($J$=2-1) line at 230 GHz was detected along with continuum emission from its dust coma and large ($\sim$140 km) nucleus, revealing the nature of the activity drivers and outgassing kinematics of the largest Oort cloud comet discovered to date. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for CO and a stringent upper limit for the H$_2$CO production rate. CO outgassing displayed multiple active jets which evolved from one epoch to the next. The continuum emission was compact and spatially unresolved, and is consistent with thermal emission from the large nucleus and a tentative detection of a dust coma. Complementary optical observations provided activity context for the ALMA epochs, indicating that UN271 underwent an outburst in late February before returning to a quiescent brightness in mid--late March. These results represent the first secure detection of molecular activity reported in the literature for C/2014 UN271 and highlight the dynamic nature of this distantly active small world.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VII. SOPHIE discovery of BEBOP-3b, a circumbinary giant planet on an eccentric orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems orbiting close binaries are valuable testing grounds for planet formation and migration models. More detections with good mass measurements are needed. We present a new planet discovered during the BEBOP survey for circumbinary exoplanets using radial velocities. We use data taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, and perform a spectroscopic analysis to obtain high precision radial velocities. This planet is the first radial velocity detection of a previously unknown circumbinary system. The planet has a mass of $0.56$ $M_{Jup}$ and orbits its host binary in 550 days with an eccentricity of 0.25. Compared to most of the previously known circumbinary planets, BEBOP-3b has a long period (relative to the binary) and a high eccentricity. There also is a candidate outer planet with a $\sim1400$ day orbital period. We test the stability of potential further candidate signals inside the orbit of BEBOP-3b, and demonstrate that there are stable orbital solutions for planets near the instability region which is where the Kepler circumbinary planets are located. We also use our data to obtain independent dynamical masses for the two stellar components of the eclipsing binary using High Resolution Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (HRCCS), and compare those results to a more traditional approach, finding them compatible with one another.</description>

      <title>Refining Bounds for Snyder and GUP Models through Seismic Wave Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>
