      <title>Hamilton cycles in regular graphs perturbed by a random 2-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for each $d \ge 3$, the union of a $d$-regular graph with a uniformly random $2$-factor on the same vertex set is Hamiltonian with high probability. This resolves a conjecture by Dragani\'c and Keevash for all values of $d$ but $d=2$.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors in the complete graph $K_n$, is a central object in combinatorial optimization, with applications ranging from max-cut problems to correlation analysis. Building on a probabilistic interpretation via agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables, we derive an explicit closed-form formula for enumerating the vertices of the related polytope $1$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$. Our approach is based on a natural binary encoding of cut vectors and introduces the alternating cycle function, a map that generates integer sequences with palindromic and recursive structure. This encoding directly captures the vertex structure and reveals that the scaled encoded vertices, perhaps unexpectedly, exhibit an almost-linear behaviour. This work provides the first explicit vertex enumeration formula for this classical polytope family.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of Linear-Compartmental Mammillary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear compartmental models are a widely used tool for analyzing systems arising in biology, medicine, and more. In such settings, it is essential to know whether model parameters can be recovered from experimental data. This is the identifiability problem. For a class of linear compartmental models with one input and one output, namely, those for which the underlying graph is a bidirected tree, Bortner et al. completely characterized which such models are structurally identifiability, which means that every parameter is generically locally identifiable. Here, we delve deeper, by examining which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable. Specifically, we analyze mammillary models, which consist of one central compartment which is connected to all other (peripheral) compartments. For these models, which fall into five infinite families, we determine which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable, and we give formulas for some of the globally identifiable parameters in terms of the coefficients of input-output equations. Our proofs rely on a combinatorial formula due to Bortner et al. for these coefficients.</description>

      <title>Evasive Random Walks and the Clairvoyant Demon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of random walks $(R,S)$ on the vertices of a graph $G$ is {\it successful} if two tokens can be scheduled (moving only one token at a time) to travel along $R$ and $S$ without colliding. We consider questions related to P. Winkler's {\it clairvoyant demon problem}, which asks whether for random walks $R$ and $S$ on $G$, $Pr[\ (R,S) \mbox{ is successful }] &gt;0$. We introduce the notion of an {\it evasive} walk on $G$: a walk $S$ so that for a random walk $R$ on $G$, $Pr[\ (R,S) \mbox{ is successful }]&gt;0$. We characterize graphs $G$ having evasive walks, giving explicit constructions on such $G$. On a cycle, we show that with high probability the tokens must collide quickly. Finally we consider two variants of the problem for which, under certain assumptions on the graph $G$, we provide algorithms that schedule $(R,S)$ successfully with positive probability.</description>

      <title>$s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting families for finite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set are called $s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting if each member in $\mathcal{F}$ (resp. $\mathcal{G}$) is $t$-disjoint with at most $s$ members in $\mathcal{G}$ (resp. $\mathcal{F}$). In this paper, we characterize the $s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting families with the maximum product of their sizes. Furthermore, we provide a corresponding stability result after studying the $s$-almost cross-$t$-intersecting families which are not cross-$t$-intersecting.</description>

      <title>Single-exponential bounds for diagonals of D-finite power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D-finite power series appear ubiquitously in combinatorics, number theory, and mathematical physics. They satisfy systems of linear partial differential equations whose solution spaces are finite-dimensional, which makes them enjoy a lot of nice properties. After attempts by others in the 1980s, Lipshitz was the first to prove that the class they form in the multivariate case is closed under the operation of diagonal. In particular, an earlier work by Gessel had addressed the D-finiteness of the diagonals of multivariate rational power series. In this paper, we give another proof of Gessel's result that fixes a gap in his original proof, while extending it to the full class of D-finite power series. We also provide a single exponential bound on the degree and order of the defining differential equation satisfied by the diagonal of a D-finite power series in terms of the degree and order of the input differential system.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of geometric Weierstrass points of metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result states that on a smooth algebraic curve of genus $g$ the number of Weierstrass points, counted with multiplicity, is $g^3-g$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of geometric Weierstrass points of metric graphs and show that a generic metric graph of genus $g$ has $g^3-g$ geometric Weierstrass points counted with multiplicity. Our methods also provide a new proof of the existence of Weierstrass points on metric graphs of genus bigger than or equal to $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds on a decomposition of a Cayley tree using the notion of a record, a concept closely related to the blob encoding of a tree introduced by Kreweras and Moszkowski, and Picciotto, that we explore and extend. We provide an alternative definition of parking functions and derive from it a record-preserving bijection between Cayley trees and parking functions. Finally, we use this bijection to establish an equidistribution between a sextuple of statistics on Cayley trees and a corresponding sextuple of statistics on parking functions.</description>

      <title>5-regular graphs and the 3-dimensional rigidity matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bar-joint framework $(G,p)$ in Euclidean $d$-space is rigid if the only edge-length-preserving continuous motions arise from isometries of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In the generic case, rigidity is determined by the generic $d$-dimensional rigidity matroid of $G$. The combinatorial nature of this matroid is well understood when $d=1,2$ but open when $d\geq 3$. Jackson and Jord\'an 2005 characterised independence in this matroid for connected graphs with minimum degree at most $d+1$ and maximum degree at most $d+2$. Their characterisation is known to be false for $(d+2)$-regular graphs when $d\geq 4$ but when $d=3$ it remained open. Indeed they conjectured that their characterisation extends to 5-regular graphs when $d=3$. The purpose of this article is to prove their conjecture. That is, we prove that every 5-regular graph that has at most $3n-6$ edges in any subgraph on $n\geq 3$ vertices is independent in the generic 3-dimensional rigidity matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish tight lower and upper bounds on the number of edges in traceable graphs in several classes of dense graphs. A graph is traceable if it has a Hamiltonian path. We show that the bound is: - quadratic for the class of graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity, bounded size of maximum induced matching or bounded cluster vertex deletion number; - n log n for the class of cographs or, more generaly, bounded modular-width, and for the class of bounded distance to cograph; and - sligthly superlinear for the class of bounded shrub-depth.</description>

      <title>Identifying Orbit Lengths for Promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study Sch\"utzenberger's promotion operator on standard Young tableaux via a corresponding graphical construction known as $m-$diagrams. In particular, we prove that certain internal structures of SYT are preserved under promotion and correspond to distinct components of $m-$diagrams. By treating these structures as atomic parts of the $m-$diagram, we provide a simple algorithm for computing the promotion orbit length of rectangular SYT. We conclude the paper by applying our results to (column) semi-standard Young tableaux and prove a formula for the promotion orbit lengths of rectangular (column) SSYT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we explore the structure of inversion graphs of permutations--a class of graphs that naturally arises by representing each permutation as a graph, where vertices correspond to entries and edges encode inversions. Advantageously, this class also arises from several other definitions that relate these graphs to geometry and partially ordered sets. By leveraging these different perspectives, we are equipped to gain many insights into their combinatorial intricacies.</description>

      <title>Statistics of maximal independent sets in grid-like graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An independent set $I$ in a graph $G$ is maximal if $I$ is not properly contained in any other independent set of $G$. The study of maximal independent sets (MIS's) in various graphs is well-established, often focusing upon enumeration of the set of MIS's. For an arbitrary graph $G$, it is typically quite difficult to understand the number and structure of MIS's in $G$; however, when $G$ has regular structure, the problem may be more tractable. One class of graphs for which enumeration of MIS's is fairly well-understood is the rectangular grid graphs $G_{m\times n}$.
  We say a graph is grid-like if it is locally isomorphic to a square grid, though the global structure of such a graph might resemble a surface such as a torus or M\"obius strip. We study the properties of MIS's in various types of grid-like graphs, in particular determining parity of the set of MIS's, average size of MIS's, and number of pairwise non-isomorphic MIS's in various grid-like graphs.</description>

      <title>Some more constructions of $n-$cycle permutation polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $ n-$cycle permutation polynomials with small n have the advantage that their compositional inverses are efficient in terms of implementation. These permutation polynomials have significant applications in cryptography and coding theory. In this article, we propose criteria for the construction of $ n-$cycle permutation using linearized polynomial $ L(x) $ for larger $ n $. Furthermore, we investigate and generalize certain novel forms of $ n-$cycle permutation polynomials. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by constructing explicit $ n-$cycle permutation of the form $ L(x)+\gamma h(Tr_{q^{m}/q}(x)) $, and $ G(x)+\gamma f(x) $ with a Boolean function $ f(x) $. The polynomial $ x^{d}+\gamma f(x) $ with $ f(x) $ being a Boolean function is shown to be quadruple and quintuple permutation polynomials. Moreover, linear binomial triple-cycle permutation polynomials are constructed.</description>

Abstract: A Condorcet winning set addresses the Condorcet paradox by selecting a few candidates--rather than a single winner--such that no unselected alternative is preferred to all of them by a majority of voters. This idea extends to $\alpha$-undominated sets, which ensure the same property for any $\alpha$-fraction of voters and are guaranteed to exist in constant size for any $\alpha$. However, the requirement that an outsider be preferred to every member of the set can be overly restrictive and difficult to justify in many applications. Motivated by this, we introduce a more flexible notion: $(t, \alpha)$-undominated sets. Here, each voter compares an outsider to their $t$-th most preferred member of the set, and the set is undominated if no outsider is preferred by more than an $\alpha$-fraction of voters. This framework subsumes prior definitions, recovering Condorcet winning sets when $(t = 1, \alpha = 1/2)$ and $\alpha$-undominated sets when $t = 1$, and introduces a new, tunable notion of collective acceptability for $t &gt; 1$. We establish three main results:
  1. We prove that a $(t, \alpha)$-undominated set of size $O(t/\alpha)$ exists for all values of $t$ and $\alpha$.
  2. We show that as $t$ becomes large, the minimum size of such a set approaches $t/\alpha$, which is asymptotically optimal.
  3. In the special case $t = 1$, we improve the bound on the size of an $\alpha$-undominated set given by Charikar, Lassota, Ramakrishnan, Vetta, and Wang (STOC 2025). As a consequence, we show that a Condorcet winning set of five candidates exists, improving their bound of six.</description>

Abstract: Volume polynomials measure the growth of Minkowski sums of convex bodies and of tensor powers of positive line bundles on projective varieties. We show that Aluffi's covolume polynomials are precisely the polynomial differential operators that preserve volume polynomials, reflecting a duality between homology and cohomology. We then present several applications to matroid theory.</description>

      <title>A framework unifying some bijections for graphs and its connection to Lawrence polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07376v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The Jacobian group (also known as the Picard group or sandpile group) of $G$ is a finite abelian group whose cardinality equals the number of spanning trees of $G$. The Jacobian group admits a canonical simply transitive action on the set $\mathcal{R}(G)$ of cycle-cocycle reversal classes of orientations of $G$. Hence one can construct combinatorial bijections between spanning trees of $G$ and $\mathcal{R}(G)$ to build connections between spanning trees and the Jacobian group. The BBY bijections and the Bernardi bijections are two important examples. In this paper, we construct a new family of such bijections that includes both. Our bijections depend on a pair of atlases (different from the ones in manifold theory) that abstract and generalize certain common features of the two known bijections. The definitions of these atlases are derived from triangulations and dissections of the Lawrence polytopes associated to $G$. The acyclic cycle signatures and cocycle signatures used to define the BBY bijections correspond to regular triangulations. Our bijections can extend to subgraph-orientation correspondences. Most of our results hold for regular matroids. We present our work in the language of fourientations, which are a generalization of orientations.</description>

      <title>On CNF formulas irredundant with respect to unit clause propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01750v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two CNF formulas are called ucp-equivalent, if they behave in the same way with respect to the unit clause propagation (UCP). A formula is called ucp-irredundant, if removing any clause leads to a formula which is not ucp-equivalent to the original one. As a consequence of known results, the ratio of the size of a ucp-irredundant formula and the size of a smallest ucp-equivalent formula is at most $n^2$, where $n$ is the number of the variables. We demonstrate an example of a ucp-irredundant formula for a symmetric definite Horn function which is larger than a smallest ucp-equivalent formula by a factor $\Omega(n/\ln n)$. Consequently, a general upper bound on the above ratio cannot be smaller than this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a classic result of Gessel, the exponential generating functions for $k$-regular graphs are D-finite. Using Gr\"obner bases in Weyl algebras, we compute the linear differential equations satisfied by the generating function for 5-, 6-, and 7- regular graphs. The method is sufficiently robust to consider variants such as graphs with multiple edges, loops, and graphs whose degrees are limited to fixed sets of values.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic enumeration and limit shapes of monotone grid classes of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a procedure to asymptotically enumerate monotone grid classes of permutations. This is then applied to compute the asymptotic number of permutations in any connected one-corner class. Our strategy consists of enumerating the gridded permutations, finding the asymptotic distribution of points between the cells in a typical large gridded permutation, and analysing in detail the ways in which a typical permutation can be gridded. We also determine the limit shape of any connected monotone grid class.</description>

      <title>A polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums and the odd/even minimal excludant in integer partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of the minimal excludant in integer partitions by G.E. Andrews and D. Newman, we introduce a pair of new partition statistics, sqrank and rerank. It is related to a polynomial bosonic form of statistical configuration sums for an integrable cellular automaton. For all nonnegative integer $n$, we prove that the partitions of $n$ on which sqrank or rerank takes on a particular value, say $r$, are equinumerous with the partitions of $n$ on which the odd/even minimal exclutant takes on the corresponding value, $2r+1$ or $2r+2$.</description>

      <title>Sets of equiangular lines in dimension $18$ constructed from $A_9 \oplus A_9 \oplus A_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, Greaves et~al.\ constructed several sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension 18. Using the concept of switching root introduced by Cao et~al.\ in 2021, these sets of equiangular lines are embedded in a lattice of rank 19 spanned by norm 3 vectors together with a switching root. We characterize this lattice as an overlattice of the root lattice $A_9\oplus A_9\oplus A_1$, and show that there are at least $246896$ sets of 57 equiangular lines in dimension $18$ arising in this way, up to isometry. Additionally, we prove that all of these sets of equiangular lines are strongly maximal. Here, a set of equiangular lines is said to be strongly maximal if there is no set of equiangular lines properly containing it even if the dimension of the underlying space is increased. Among these sets, there are ones with only six distinct Seidel eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Convex Geometries via Hopf Monoids: Combinatorial Invariants, Reciprocity, and Supersolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hopf monoid of convex geometries, which contains partial orders as a Hopf submonoid, and investigate the combinatorial invariants arising from canonical characters. Each invariant consists of a pair: a polynomial and a more general quasisymmetric function. We give combinatorial descriptions of the polynomial invariants and prove combinatorial reciprocity theorems for the Edelman-Jamison and Billera-Hsiao-Provan polynomials, which generalize the order and enriched order polynomials, respectively, within a unified framework. For the quasisymmetric invariants, we show that their coefficients enumerate faces of certain simplicial complexes, including subcomplexes of the Coxeter complex and a simplicial sphere structure introduced by Billera, Hsiao, and Provan. We also examine the associated $ab$- and $cd$-indices. We establish an equivalent condition for convex geometries to be supersolvable and use this result to give a geometric interpretation of the $ab$- and $cd$-index coefficients for this class of convex geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a smooth $d$-manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^d$ if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function, i.e., a smooth map $f:M\to\mathbb R$ that is proper, lower-bounded, and has a unique critical point. By constructing such functions, we deduce that the moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages and configurations are diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces. This resolves the Refined Carpenter's Rule Problem and confirms a conjecture proposed by Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza. We further describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions and develop algorithms for related problems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian connectivity of some base-cobase graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been wide interest in understanding which properties of base graphs of matroids extend to base-cobase graphs of matroids. A significant result of Naddef and Pulleyblank (1984) shows that the $1$-skeleton of any $(0,1)$-polytope is either a hypercube, or Hamiltonian-connected, i.e. there is a Hamiltonian path connecting any two vertices. In particular, this is true for base graphs of matroids. A natural question raised by Farber, Richter, and Shank (1985) is whether this extends to base-cobase graphs.
  First, we use the polytopal approach to show Hamiltonian connectivity of base-cobase graphs of series-parallel extensions of lattice path matroids. On the other hand, we show that this method extends to only very special classes related to identically self-dual matroids. Second, we show that base-cobase graphs of wheels and whirls are Hamiltonian connected. Last, we show that the regular matroid $R_{10}$ yields a negative answer to the question of Farber, Richter, and Shank.</description>

      <title>Is it easier to count communities than find them?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graph models with community structure have been studied extensively in the literature. For both the problems of detecting and recovering community structure, an interesting landscape of statistical and computational phase transitions has emerged. A natural unanswered question is: might it be possible to infer properties of the community structure (for instance, the number and sizes of communities) even in situations where actually finding those communities is believed to be computationally hard? We show the answer is no. In particular, we consider certain hypothesis testing problems between models with different community structures, and we show (in the low-degree polynomial framework) that testing between two options is as hard as finding the communities.
  Our methods give the first computational lower bounds for testing between two different ``planted'' distributions, whereas previous results have considered testing between a planted distribution and an i.i.d. ``null'' distribution. We also show a formal relationship between the low--degree frameworks for recovery in a planted model and for testing two planted models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive one-weight codes over a finite field of non-prime order are equivalent to special subspace coverings of the points of a projective space, which we call multispreads. The current paper is devoted to the characterization of the parameters of multispreads, which is equivalent to the characterization of the parameters of additive one-weight codes and, via duality, of additive completely regular codes of covering radius 1 (intriguing sets). We characterize these parameters for the case of the prime-square order of the field and make a partial characterization for the prime-cube case and the case of the fourth degree of a prime, including a complete characterization for orders 8, 27, and 16.

      <title>The Square-Root Law Does Not Hold in the Presence of Zero Divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13248v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring (with unit, not necessarily commutative) and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law of the form $|\hat{P}(\chi)|\leq C|R|^{-d}|P|^\frac{1}{2}$ for some fixed constant $C$ (for instance, if $R$ is a finite field, this bound will be satisfied with $C = 1$). Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields.
  Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative probabilistic proof for the sharp Assouad--Nagata dimension bound of a doubling metric space. In addition, we explore some partial rigidity results and applications to scalar curvature. A significant technical tool in our argument is the concept of padded decomposition, which originates in computer science and has been extended to general separable metric spaces by us. Along the way, we extend the sharp upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of graphs with polynomial growth to noncollapsed locally compact metric measure spaces with polynomial volume growth. This sheds light on broader applications of probabilistic methods in metric geometry.</description>

Abstract: Local certification is a topic originating from distributed computing, where a prover tries to convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$. To convince the vertices, the prover gives a small piece of information, called certificate, to each vertex, and the vertices then decide whether the property $\mathcal{P}$ is satisfied by just looking at their certificate and the certificates of their neighbors. When studying a property $\mathcal{P}$ in the perspective of local certification, the aim is to find the optimal size of the certificates needed to certify $\mathcal{P}$, which can be viewed a measure of the local complexity of $\mathcal{P}$.
  A certification scheme is considered to be efficient if the size of the certificates is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. While there have been a number of meta-theorems providing efficient certification schemes for general graph classes, the proofs of the lower bounds on the size of the certificates are usually very problem-dependent.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of hardness reduction in local certification, and show that we can transfer a lower bound on the certificates for a property $\mathcal{P}$ to a lower bound for another property $\mathcal{P}'$, via a (local) hardness reduction from $\mathcal{P}$ to $\mathcal{P}'$. We then give a number of applications in which we obtain polynomial lower bounds for many classical properties using such reductions.</description>

      <title>The stable limit DAHA: the structure of the standard representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of results about the structure of the standard representation of the stable limit DAHA. More precisely, we address the triangularity, spectrum, and eigenfunctions of the limit Cherednik operators, and construct several PBW-type bases for the stable limit DAHA. We establish a remarkable triangularity property concerning the contribution of certain special elements of the PBW basis of a finite rank DAHA of high enough rank to the PBW expansion of a PBW basis element of the stable limit DAHA. The triangularity property implies the faithfulness of the standard representation. This shows that the algebraic structure defined by the limit operators associated to elements of the finite rank DAHAs is precisely the stable limit DAHA.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology and singular cohomology of toric varieties via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an affine toric variety $X$ embedded in a smooth variety, we prove a general result about the mixed Hodge module structure on the local cohomology sheaves of $X$. As a consequence, we prove that the singular cohomology of a proper toric variety is mixed of Hodge-Tate type. Additionally, using these Hodge module techniques, we derive a purely combinatorial result on rational polyhedral cones that has consequences regarding the depth of reflexive differentials on a toric variety.
  We then study in detail two important subclasses of toric varieties: those corresponding to cones over simplicial polytopes and those corresponding to cones over simple polytopes. Here, we give a comprehensive description of the local cohomology in terms of the combinatorics of the associated cones, and calculate the Betti numbers (or more precisely, the Hodge-Du Bois diamond) of a projective toric variety associated to a simple polytope.</description>
