      <title>Scaling Symmetry Reductions of Coupled KdV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the Painlev\'e reductions of coupled KdV systems. We start by comparing the procedure with that of {\em stationary reductions}. Indeed, we see that exactly the same construction can be used at each step and parallel results obtained. For simplicity, we restrict attention to the $t_2$ flow of the KdV and DWW hierarchies and derive respectively 2 and 3 compatible Poisson brackets, which have identical {\em structure} to those of their stationary counterparts. In the KdV case, we derive a discrete version, which is a non-autonomous generalisation of the well known Darboux transformation of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <title>On the coupled Maxwell-Bloch system of equations with non-decaying fields at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP) for a system of coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations (CMBE) that model two colors or polarizations of light resonantly interacting with a degenerate, two-level, active optical medium with an excited state and a pair of degenerate ground states. We assume that the electromagnetic field approaches non-vanishing plane waves in the far past and future. This type of interaction has been found to underlie nonlinear optical phenomena including electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, stopped light, and quantum memory. Under the assumptions of unidirectional, lossless propagation of slowly-modulated plane waves, the resulting CMBE become completely integrable in the sense of possessing a Lax Pair. In this paper, we formulate an inverse scattering transform (IST) corresponding to these CMBE and their Lax pair, allowing for the spectral line of the atomic transitions in the active medium to have a finite width. The scattering problem for this Lax pair is the same as for the Manakov system. The main advancement in this IST for CMBE is calculating the nontrivial spatial propagation of the spectral data and determining the state of the optical medium in the distant future from that in the distant past, which is needed for the complete formulation of the IBVP. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is used to extract the spatio-temporal dependence of the solution from the evolving spectral data. We further derive and analyze several types of solitons and determine their velocity and stability, as well as find dark states of the medium which fail to interact with a given pulse.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  We evaluate various limits. More precisely, we tweak the MZ chain to allow for a short-range limit, and show it is the XX model with q-deformed antiperiodic boundary conditions. Taking $q\to 1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. It, too, can be adjusted to admit a short-range limit, which we demonstrate to be the antiperiodic XX model. By identifying the translation operator of the MZ chain, which is nontrivial, we show that antiperiodicity is a persistent feature.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry chains. We find that the landscapes only share a single point: the rational Haldane--Shastry chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the antiperiodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian discrete Toda chains and related lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have derived a non-abelian analog for the two-dimensional discrete Toda lattice which possesses solutions in terms of quasideterminants and admits Lax pairs of different forms. Its connection with non-abelian analogs for several well-known (1+1) and one-dimensional lattices is discussed. In particular, we consider a non-commutative analog of the scheme: discrete Toda equations $\rightarrow$ Somos-$N$ sequences $\rightarrow$ discrete Painlev\'e equations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Overlaps from Functional Separation of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how the Functional Separation of Variables (FSoV) method can be applied to the problem of computing overlaps with integrable boundary states in integrable systems. We demonstrate our general method on the example of a particular boundary state, a singlet of the symmetry group, in an su(3) rational spin chain in an alternating fundamental--anti-fundamental representation. The FSoV formalism allows us to compute in determinant form not only the overlaps of the boundary state with the eigenstates of the transfer matrix, but in fact with any factorisable state. This includes off-shell Bethe states, whose overlaps with the boundary state have been out of reach with other methods. Furthermore, we also found determinant representations for insertions of so-called Principal Operators (forming a complete algebra of all observables) between the boundary and the factorisable state as well as certain types of multiple insertions of Principal Operators. Concise formulas for the matrix elements of the boundary state in the SoV basis and su(N) generalisations are presented. Finally, we managed to construct a complete basis of integrable boundary states by repeated action of conserved charges on the singlet state. As a result, we are also able to compute the overlaps of all of these states with integral of motion eigenstates.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>
