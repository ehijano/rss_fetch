      <title>Probabilistic Bounds on the Number of Elements to Generate Finite Nilpotent Groups and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a new probabilistic bound on the number of elements to generate finite nilpotent groups. Let $\varphi_k(G)$ denote the probability that $k$ random elements generate a finite nilpotent group $G$. For any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, we prove that $\varphi_k(G) \ge 1 - \epsilon$ if $k \ge \operatorname{rank}(G) + \lceil \log_2(2/\epsilon) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group rank) or if $k \ge \operatorname{len}(G) + \lceil \log_2(1/\epsilon) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group chain length). Moreover, these bounds are shown to be nearly tight. Both bounds sharpen the previously known requirement of $k \ge \lceil \log_2 |G| + \log_2(1/\epsilon) \rceil + 2$. Our results provide a foundational tool for analyzing probabilistic algorithms, enabling a better estimation of the iteration count for the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) standard quantum algorithm and a reduction in the circuit repetitions required by Regev's factoring algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a complete quantum-classical hybrid branch-and-bound algorithm (QCBB) to solve binary linear programs with equality constraints. That includes bound calculation, convergence metrics and optimality guarantee to the quantum optimization based algorithm, which makes our method directly comparable to classical methods. Key aspects of the proposed algorithm are (i) encapsulation of the quantum optimization method, (ii) utilization of noisy samples for problem reduction, (iii) classical approximation based bound calculation, (iv) branch and bound traits like gap-based stopping criterion and monotonic increase in solution quality, (v) integrated composition of many different solutions that can be improved individually. We show numerical results on set partitioning problem instances and provide many details about the characteristics of the different steps of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>SPARTA: $\chi^2$-calibrated, risk-controlled exploration-exploitation for variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms face a fundamental trainability crisis: barren plateaus render optimization exponentially difficult as system size grows. While recent Lie algebraic theory precisely characterizes when and why these plateaus occur, no practical optimization method exists with finite-sample guarantees for navigating them. We present the sequential plateau-adaptive regime-testing algorithm (SPARTA), the first measurement-frugal scheduler that provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization. Our approach integrates three components with rigorous statistical foundations: (i) a $\chi^2$-calibrated sequential test that distinguishes barren plateaus from informative regions using likelihood-ratio supermartingales; (ii) a probabilistic trust-region exploration strategy with one-sided acceptance to prevent false improvements under shot noise; and (iii) a theoretically-optimal exploitation phase that achieves the best attainable convergence rate. We prove geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and show how Lie-algebraic variance proxies enhance test power without compromising statistical calibration.</description>

      <title>Modelling and experimental verification of photoelectrical response of NV diamond spin centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.</description>

      <title>Monogamy of Mutual Information in Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monogamy of mutual information (MMI) is a quantum entropy inequality that enforces the non-positivity of tripartite information. We investigate the failure of MMI in graph states as a forbidden-subgraph phenomenon, conjecturing that every MMI-violating graph state is local-Clifford equivalent to one whose graph contains a four-star subgraph. We construct a family of star-like graphs whose states fail a specific class of MMI instances, and extend this analysis to general star topologies. Deriving adjacency matrix constraints that fix the MMI evaluation for these instances and interpreting them physically, we prove the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for this family of graphs. Finally, through an exhaustive search over graph representatives for all $8$-qubit stabilizer entropy vectors, we establish that MMI failure is not reducible to the cases within our scope.</description>

      <title>Holographic duality between bulk topological order and boundary mixed-state order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for analyzing the steady states of repeated quantum channels with strong symmetries. Using channel-state duality, we show that the steady state of a $d$-dimensional quantum channel is holographically mapped to the boundary reduced density matrix of a $(d+1)$-dimensional wavefunction generated by a sequential unitary circuit. From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS. Built on isoTNS, we further construct continuously tunable quantum channels that exhibit distinct mixed-state phases and transitions in the steady states.</description>

      <title>Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.</description>

      <title>No-go theorems for sequential preparation of two-dimensional chiral states via channel-state correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether sequential unitary circuits can prepare two-dimensional chiral states, using a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. We establish two no-go theorems, one for Gaussian fermion systems and one for generic interacting systems. In Gaussian fermion systems, the correspondence relates the defining features of chiral wave functions in their entanglement spectrum to the algebraic decaying correlations in the steady state of channel dynamics. We establish the no-go theorem by proving that local channel dynamics with translational invariance cannot support such correlations. As a direct implication, two-dimensional Gaussian fermion isometric tensor network states cannot support algebraically decaying correlations in all directions or represent a chiral state. In generic interacting systems, we establish a no-go theorem by showing that the state prepared by sequential circuits cannot host the tripartite entanglement of a chiral state due to the constraints from causality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hardware-Efficient Selection of Auxiliary Variables for QUBO Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) requires considered optimization problems to be translated into a compatible format. A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%. An implementation of all proposed methods is publicly available at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/problemsolver.</description>

      <title>Shake before use: universal enhancement of quantum thermometry by unitary driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19631v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>High-Order Splitting of Non-Unitary Operators on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order splitting method for simulating non-unitary dynamics by sequential real- and imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolutions. Complex-coefficient splitting methods with positive real parts are chosen for stable integration in a quantum circuit, avoiding the unstable, norm-amplifying negative steps that arise from real-coefficient splitting at high orders. The method is most beneficial for dynamics that naturally separate into unitary and dissipative components, with broad applications across science and engineering. These systems frequently admit compact spectral representations of the split operators, which we demonstrate by deriving efficient quantum circuits for simulating the damped-wave equation with up to sixth-order accuracy in time. A single sixth-order step in three dimensions on 35 trillion cells requires 1,562 CNOT gates, which can be executed within the coherence time of modern quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flow and Exceptional-Point Structure in Two-Mode Squeezed-Bath Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Rare-Earth Ions in Heterogeneous Photonic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Infrared absorption spectroscopy of a single polyatomic molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for probing molecular structure. However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Effects of Detuning and Auxiliary Qubits on Quantum Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19697v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how detuning and auxiliary qubits collaboratively enhance quantum synchronization in a dissipative multi-qubit system that is coupled to a structured reservoir. Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.</description>

      <title>Localization and Delocalization of Quantum Trajectories in the Liouvillian Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Assisted Clifford Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce a method to synthesize an $n$-qubit Clifford unitary $C$ from the stabilizer tableau of its inverse $C\dag$, using ancilla qubits and measurements. The procedure uses ancillary $|+\rangle$ states, controlled-Paulis, $X$-basis measurements and single-qubit Pauli corrections on the data qubits (based on the measurement results). This introduces a new normal form for Clifford synthesis, with the number of two-qubit gates required exactly equal to the weight of the stabilizer tableau, and a depth linear in $n$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Framework for Wavelet Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for quantum wavelet shrinkage, extending classical denoising ideas into the quantum domain. Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage.</description>

      <title>Suboptimality of Parity for Distilling Correlations with Nontrivial Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the PARITY protocol is optimal for a general class of non-adaptive distillation protocols of all $n$ player nonlocal boxes (NLBs) based on XOR games. The conditional distributions generated by these NLBs are assumed to have trivial local marginals. We also show that already for $n=2$, PARITY is no longer optimal if the local marginals are non-trivial. The OR protocol is shown to perform better and in the process also slightly extend the known correlations that collapse communication complexity. This emphasizes again the need to understand the local properties of nonlocal systems in order to obtain a better characterization of the global behavior. We conclude by showing an equivalence between adaptive distillation protocols that use identical NLBs and PARITY protocol using nonidentical NLBs.</description>

      <title>Error-structure-tailored early fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault tolerance is widely regarded as indispensable for achieving scalable and reliable quantum computing. However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\varphi|\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications. Compared to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation and magic state cultivation approaches, our method reduces spacetime resource costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6, respectively, for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation task under realistic hardware assumptions.</description>

      <title>Virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual maps allow the simulation of quantum operations by combining physical processes with classical post-processing. Recent work on virtual unitary covariant broadcasting has shown, however, that such maps remain impractical for observable estimation tasks due to poor sample efficiency. Here we investigate whether relaxing the symmetry requirements can improve operational performance, focusing on virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits. We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning. Despite these improvements, the resulting virtual broadcasting map remains sample-inefficient and is therefore still operationally impractical.</description>

      <title>Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</description>

      <title>Real and Fourier space readout methods: Comparison of complexity and applications to CFD problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising technology that accelerates the partial differential equations solver for practical problems. The reconstruction of solutions (i.e., the readout of quantum states) remains a crucial problem, although numerous efficient quantum algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we propose and compare several efficient readout methods in the real and the Fourier space. The Fourier space readout (FSR) and the proposed approximate real space readout (ARSR) methods are currently the most efficient and practical ones for the purpose of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions. In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>An Adaptable Route to Fast Coherent State Transport via Bang-Bang-Bang Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast coherent state transport is essential to quantum computation and quantum information processing. While an adiabatic transport of atomic qubits guarantees a high fidelity of the state preparation, it requires a long timescale that defies efficient quantum operations. Here, we propose an adaptable and fast bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol, utilizing a combination of forwardand backward-moving trap potentials, to expedite the coherent state transport. This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation. Our protocols outperform conventional forward-moving-only methods, providing new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport and preparation, ultimately advancing the capabilities of quantum control and quantum operations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of the Vacuum Beam Guide and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed vacuum beam guide (VBG) represents an innovation in the field of quantum channel technology, guaranteeing an ultra-low level of attenuation and a broad transmission linewidth, which offers an unprecedented quantum capacity exceeding Tera-qubits per second on a continental scale. However, its stability in terms of interferometry remains unexamined. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive error model that captures the intrinsic phase noise power spectral density associated with VBG, thereby revealing the advantages of VBG for interferometry over existing techniques. This model facilitates a comprehensive characterization of VBG as a photonic quantum channel, thereby facilitating a detailed investigation of its potential. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of VBG and its expected performance in a wide range of quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: Resonator Design and Role in Qubit Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.</description>

      <title>The Cumulants Expansion Approach: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration space, i.e. the Hilbert space, of compound quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of its subsystems: its dimensionality is given by the product of the dimensions of its constituents. Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20133v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental implementation of a three-time-bin phase-encoded Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocol using a Sagnac-based star-topology plug-and-play architecture. The proposed encoding method leverages the relative phases of three consecutive time bins to encode two bits per signal. The Sagnac loop configuration enables self-compensation for both phase and polarisation drifts, eliminating the need for active stabilisation. However, field deployments are subject to rapid phase fluctuations caused by external vibrations, which can degrade interference visibility. We used the first time bin for real-time phase-fluctuation monitoring. Although this monitoring reduces the effective key generation rate, the system achieved a secure key rate of approximately 1.5e-5 bits per pulse, with a corresponding visibility of up to 87% over a 50 km asymmetric optical fibre channel. These results demonstrate the practicality, stability, and scalability of the proposed three-time-bin TF-QKD protocol for real-world quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Complexity-Algorithm Account of Constant-Round QAOA Expectation Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is widely studied for combinatorial optimization and has achieved significant advances both in theoretical guarantees and practical performance, yet for general combinatorial optimization problems the expected performance and classical simulability of fixed-round QAOA remain unclear. Focusing on Max-Cut, we first show that for general graphs and any fixed round $p\ge2$, exactly evaluating the expectation of fixed-round QAOA at prescribed angles is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard, and that approximating this expectation within additive error $2^{-O(n)}$ in the number $n$ of vertices is already $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. To evaluate the expected performance of QAOA, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm leveraging tree decomposition. As a byproduct, when the $p$-local treewidth grows at most logarithmically with the number of vertices, this yields a polynomial-time \emph{exact} evaluation algorithm in the graph size $n$. Beyond Max-Cut, we extend the framework to general Binary Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization (BUCO). Finally, we provide reproducible evaluations for rounds up to $p=3$ on representative structured families, including the generalized Petersen graph $GP(15,2)$, double-layer triangular 2-lifts, and the truncated icosahedron graph $C_{60}$, and report cut ratios while benchmarking against locality-matched classical baselines.</description>

For quantum-to-classical measurement channels, we show that all standard quantum divergences select the same retrodictive update, yielding a unique and divergence-independent quantum Bayesian inverse for any POVM and prior state. Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states.</description>

      <title>Realizing Universal Non-Markovian Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian noise, arising from environmental memory effects, is the most general and challenging form of noise in quantum computing, and is typically difficult to characterize and suppress. Here, we analyze and experimentally demonstrate a non-Markovian noise suppression scheme inspired by quantum purification protocols. We theoretically prove that, even without noise calibration and assumptions on specific noise models, the scheme can exponentially reduce non-Markovian error rates with respect to the ancillary system size. We implement the protocol using nuclear spins, demonstrating that non-Markovian noise can be suppressed for both unitary operations and non-unitary channels. The observed fidelities and process tomography show close agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the practicality and effectiveness of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Non-Clifford GKP Gates using Polynomial Phase Gates and On-Demand Noise Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code uses a bosonic mode to encode a logical qubit, and has the attractive property that its logical Clifford gates can be implemented using Gaussian unitary gates. In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.

      <title>Proximity driven photon-tunneling in chiral quantum hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon tunneling in a pair of coupled inverted circular split-ring microwave resonators with four discrete chiral orientations. By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of the Lorentz transformation on the measures of quantum coherence in an entangled atomic system. Here, we consider the effect of this relativistic boosts on two-particle entangled generalized Gaussian wave packets in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider that the relativistic boost affects the one particle and other remains unaffected while in the second scenario, we consider that both the particles are affected by the effect of the relativistic boost. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the boost parameter and the width of the Gaussian wave packets. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with increase in the width of the Gaussian wave packet, higher values of boost parameter, and the number of particles on which boost is applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the run-time and energy consumption of simulating non-equilibrium dynamics on neutral atom quantum computers in analog mode, directly comparing their performance to state-of-the-art classical methods, namely Matrix Product States and Neural Quantum States. By collecting both experimental data from a quantum processing unit (QPU) in analog mode and numerical benchmarks, we enable accurate predictions of run-time and energy consumption for large-scale simulations on both QPUs and classical systems through fitting of theoretical scaling laws. Our analysis shows that neutral atom devices are already operating in a competitive regime, achieving comparable or superior performance to classical approaches while consuming significantly less energy. These results demonstrate the potential of analog neutral atom quantum computing for energy-efficient simulation and highlight a viable path toward sustainable computational strategies.</description>

      <title>Twin Hamiltonians, three types of the Dyson maps, and the probabilistic interpretation problem in quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics (QHQM) of unitary systems, an optimal, calculation-friendly form of Hamiltonian is generally non-Hermitian, $H \neq H^\dagger$. This makes its physical interpretation ambiguous. Without altering $H$, this ambiguity is resolved by specifying a nontrivial inner-product metric $\Theta$ in Hilbert space. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy: transforming $H$ into a Hermitian form via the Dyson map $\Omega: H \to \mathfrak{h}$. This construction of the Hermitian isospectral twin $\mathfrak{h}$ of $H$ does not only restore the conventional correspondence principle between quantum and classical physics, but it also provides a framework for the exhaustive classification of all admissible probabilistic interpretations of quantum systems in QHQM framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical scheme for a family of fast and high-fidelity two-qubit iSWAP gates between neutral atoms separated by more than 20 um, enabled by resonant dipole-dipole spin-exchange interactions between Rydberg states. The protocol harnesses coherent excitation-exchange-deexcitation dynamics between the qubit and the Rydberg states within a single and smooth laser pulse, in the presence of strong dipole-dipole interactions. We utilize optimal control methods to achieve theoretical gate fidelities and durations comparable to blockade-based gates in the presence of relevant noise, while extending the effective interaction range by an order of magnitude. This enables entanglement well beyond the blockade radius, offering a route toward fast, high-connectivity quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Multiple Temperatures via a Collisional Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum thermometric protocol for the estimation of multiple temperatures within the collisional model framework. Employing the formalism of multiparameter quantum metrology, we develop a systematic strategy to estimate the temperatures of several thermal reservoirs with minimal estimation error. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity of the Fisher information matrix for a bi-parametrized qubit state. By using controlled rotations of ancillary systems between successive interaction stages, we eliminate parameter interdependencies, thereby rendering the quantum Fisher information matrix non-singular. Remarkably, we demonstrate that precision enhancement in the joint estimation of multiple temperatures can be achieved even in the absence of correlations among the ancillas, surpassing the corresponding thermal Fisher information limits. Exploiting correlations within the ancillary system yields additional enhancement of Fisher information. Finally, we identify the dimensionality of the ancillary systems as a key factor governing the efficiency of multiparameter temperature estimation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Control of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Two-Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-Engineered Exceptional Points for Quantum Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points are spectral singularities where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors collapse onto a single mode, causing the system behavior to shift abruptly and making it highly responsive to even small perturbations. Although widely studied in optical and quantum systems, using them for energy storage in quantum systems has been difficult because existing approaches rely on gain, precise balanced loss, or explicitly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic local single-shot checks for toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction typically requires repeated syndrome extraction due to measurement noise, which results in substantial time overhead in fault-tolerant computation. Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performance at the circuit level. In this work, we introduce local single-shot checks, where we impose constraints on check weights. Using a dynamic measurement scheme, we show that the number of required measurement rounds can be reduced by a factor determined by this constraint. As an example, we show through numerical simulation that our scheme can improve decoding performance compared to conventional checks when using sliding-window decoding with a reduced window size under circuit-level noise models for toric codes. Our work provides a new direction for constructing checks that can reduce time overhead in large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution: Bridging Theoretical Security Proofs, Practical Attacks, and Error Correction for Quantum-Augmented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic yet practical optimization of quantum circuits implementing GF($2^m$) multiplication and division operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20618v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optimized quantum circuits for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division operations, which are essential computing primitives in various quantum algorithms. Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\lceil{m/2}\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the CNOT gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \log \log(m)/\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$, including reductions in both CNOT and Toffoli gate counts. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.</description>

      <title>Extracting conserved operators from a projected entangled pair state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tensor network state, how can we determine conserved operators (including Hamiltonians) for which the state is an eigenstate? We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Routing in Non-Isotonic Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal routing in quantum-repeater networks requires finding the best path that connects a pair of end nodes. Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Algorithms for Simultaneous Unitary Similarity and Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to solve the Simultaneous Unitary Similarity(S.U.S) problem which is to check if there exists a Similarity transformation determined by a Unitary $U$ s.t $UA_lU^*=B_l$, $l \in \{1,...,p\}$, where $A_l$ and $B_l$ are $nxn$ complex matrices. We observe that the problem is simplest when $U$ is diagonal, where we see that the `paths' in the graph defined by non-zero elements of $A_l$ and $B_l$ determine the solution. Inspired by this we generalize this to the case when $U$ is block-diagonal to identify a form refered to as the `Solution-form' using `paths' determined by non-zero sub-matrices of $A_l,B_l$ which are non-zero multiples of Unitary. When not in Solution form we find an equivalent problem to solve by diagonalizing a Hermitian or a Normal matrix related to the sub-matrices. The problem is solved in a maximum of $n$ steps. The same idea can be extended to solve the Simultaneous Unitary Equivalence(S.U.Eq) problem where we solve for $U,V$ in $UA_lV^*=B_l$, $A_l,B_l$ being $mxn$ Complex rectangular matrices. Here we work with the 'paths' in the related bi-graph to define the Solution-form. The algorithms have a complexity of $O(pn^4)$. This work finds application in Quantum Evolution, Quantum gate design and Simulation.The salient features of each step of the algorithm can be retained as Canonical features to classify a given collection of complex matrices up to Unitary Similarity.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>

      <title>On the microlocal phase space concentration of Schr\"odinger evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microlocal properties of the evolutions of Schr\"odinger equations using metaplectic Wigner distributions. So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schr\"odinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions for the Kemmer Oscillator in 1+1 Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents exact solutions of the Kemmer equation for spin-1 particles in $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime, motivated by the need to understand vector bosons under uniform acceleration, including non-inertial effects and the Unruh temperature, which distinguish them from spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems. Starting from the free Kemmer field in an accelerated reference frame, we establish eigenvalue equations resembling those of the Klein--Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates. By introducing the Dirac oscillator interaction through a momentum substitution, we derive an exact closed-form spectrum for the Kemmer oscillator, revealing how the acceleration parameter modifies the characteristic length, shifts the discrete energy spectrum, and lifts degeneracies. In the Minkowski limit $a\to 0$, the standard Kemmer oscillator spectrum is recovered, ensuring consistency with flat-spacetime results. These findings provide a tractable framework for analyzing acceleration-induced effects, with implications for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum gravity, and analogue gravity platforms.</description>

      <title>Fermionisation of the Aharonov--Bohm Phase on the Lightfront</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19756v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.</description>

      <title>Generalized Landau Paradigm for quantum phases and phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm is a central dogma for understanding phase and phase transitions in condensed matter systems, yet for decades it has been known that a variety of quantum phases exist beyond the framework. Is there a more general framework that provides a systematic understanding of phase and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems? Recent developments of the notion of generalized symmetry and generalized gauging seem to point to a way to generalize the Landau Paradigm. In this essay, we discuss how `beyond Landau' phases and phase transitions can be captured by a generalized Landau paradigm in terms of the breaking of generalized symmetries, often induced by the generalized gauging procedure facilitated through the topological holography formalism. We also discuss what needs to be understood to make the generalized Landau paradigm useful in the study of quantum phase and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Exciton collective modes in a bilayer of axion insulator $\text{MnBi}_2 \text{Te}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an exciton condensate and associated collective modes in a bilayer configuration of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$, an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and van der Waals material, recognized for hosting axion physics. Utilizing a minimal low-energy Hamiltonian for the two layer system which is gapped by the intrinsic N\'eel order, we first employ mean-field theory to establish the conditions for exciton condensation. Our analysis identifies a nonzero, spin-singlet exciton order parameter which is tuned by external displacement field, temperature, and Coulomb attraction. Beyond the mean-field, we explore collective mode fluctuations in the uncondensed phase via many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. From this, we derive the exciton spectral function which allows for a direct comparison between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We detail how the softening of the collective mode peak is a function of the competition between interlayer detuning and thermal fluctuations. This work elucidates how the unique topological and magnetic environment of $\text{MnBi}_2\text{Te}_4$ offers a tunable platform for the realization and manipulation of exciton condensates and the corresponding collective excitations. Our findings contribute to understanding the interplay of topology and bosonic condensates, which could inspire application in optically accessing topological properties, dissipationless transport, and gate-tunable optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic magnetometry in a spin-dense diamond cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for high-sensitivity magnetometry with nanometer-scale resolution. State-of-the-art implementations, however, typically rely on bulky free-space optics or sacrifice spatial resolution to achieve high sensitivities. Here, we realize an integrated platform that overcomes this trade-off by fabricating monolithic whispering-gallery-mode cavities from a diamond chip containing a high density of NV centers and by evanescently coupling excitation to and photoluminescence from the cavity using a tapered optical fiber. Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\,\text{nT}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer. The microscopic cavity size enables sub-micrometer-scale spatial resolution and low-power operation, while fiber-coupling provides a path to scalable on-chip integration. Arrays of such sensors could enable NV-NMR spectroscopy of sub-nanoliter samples, new magnetic-gradient imaging architectures, and compact biosensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrahigh Anomalous Hall Conductivities via Optimally Prepared Topological Floquet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve &gt;99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.</description>

      <title>Is the large uncertainty of $\delta_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</description>

      <title>Attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering for imaging coupled electron-hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving our understanding of electron dynamics is essential for advancing energy transfer, optoelectronics, light harvesting systems and quantum computing. Recent developments in attosecond x-ray sources provide the fundamental possibility of observing these dynamics with atomic-scale resolution. However, connecting a time-resolved signal to dynamics is challenging due to the broad bandwidth of an attosecond probe pulse. This makes exploring the capabilities of different attosecond imaging techniques crucial. Here, we propose attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a prominent technique for tracking ultrafast dynamics. We demonstrate that the scattering signal contains an information about the instantaneous distribution of charge density across the scattering atoms. To illustrate this, we consider scattering from an $\alpha$-sexithiophene molecule, in which coupled electron-hole dynamics are excited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene is a maturing material platform for gate-defined quantum dots that hosts long-lived spin and valley states. Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems. In particular, states of two and three carriers, for which the exchange interaction between particles plays a crucial role, are a cornerstone for qubit readout and manipulation. Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $\pi/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>Impact of the valence band on Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.</description>

Abstract: Weak coin flipping is an important cryptographic primitive$\unicode{x2013}$it is the strongest known secure two-party computation primitive that classically becomes secure only under certain assumptions (e.g. computational hardness), while quantumly there exist protocols that achieve arbitrarily close to perfect security. This breakthrough result was established by Mochon in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. However, his proof relied on the existence of certain unitary operators which was established by a non-constructive argument. Consequently, explicit protocols have remained elusive. In this work, we give exact constructions of related unitary operators. These, together with a new formalism, yield a family of protocols approaching perfect security thereby also simplifying Mochon's proof of existence. We illustrate the construction of explicit weak coin flipping protocols by considering concrete examples (from the aforementioned family of protocols) that are more secure than all previously known protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrized and random unitary (or orthogonal) $n$-qubit circuits play a central role in quantum information. As such, one could naturally assume that circuits implementing symplectic transformations would attract similar attention. However, this is not the case, as $\mathbb{SP} (d/2)$ -- the group of $d\times d$ unitary symplectic matrices -- has thus far been overlooked. In this work, we aim at starting to fill this gap. We begin by presenting a universal set of generators $\mathcal{G}$ for the symplectic algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(d/2)$, consisting of one- and two-qubit Pauli operators acting on neighboring sites in a one-dimensional lattice. Here, we uncover two critical differences between such set, and equivalent ones for unitary and orthogonal circuits. Namely, we find that the operators in $\mathcal{G}$ cannot generate arbitrary local symplectic unitaries and that they are not translationally invariant. We then review the Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra, and use tools from Weingarten calculus to prove that Pauli measurements at the output of Haar random symplectic circuits can converge to Gaussian processes. As a by-product, such analysis provides us with concentration bounds for Pauli measurements in circuits that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$. To finish, we present tensor-network tools to analyze shallow random symplectic circuits, and we use these to numerically show that computational-basis measurements anti-concentrate at logarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement in Monitored Random Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions in Many-body systems are typically short-range and few-body. We investigate how such local interactions build up long-range and intrinsically multipartite entanglement by studying the $n$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ($\text{GHZ}_n$) entanglement in monitored random Clifford circuits, which is well-known for a measurement-induced transition between phases of volume-law and area-law (bipartite) entanglement. We obtain a series of results: (1) About 1.25 $|\text{GHZ}_3\rangle$ can be extracted from states in the volume-law phase. This value is remarkably universal, independent of both the measurement rate and partitioning details, until a phase transition (either measurement-induced or a newly identified partitioning-induced transition) is approached. (2) Dynamically, The creation (sometimes also the annihilation) of $\text{GHZ}_3$ entanglement occur suddenly via dynamical phase transitions (DPTs). The critical points of these DPTs are governed by the entanglement speed ($v_E$) of biaprtite entanglement. (3) In stark contrast to $\text{GHZ}_{n\leq 3}$, $\text{GHZ}_{n\geq 4}$ entanglement is statistically significant only at the measurement-induced critical point, not in the bulk of the volume-law phase. Our results uncover a rich and previously overlooked hierarchy of multipartite entanglement structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing graph completeness is a critical problem in computer science and network theory. Leveraging quantum computation, we present an efficient algorithm using the Szegedy quantum walk and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our algorithm, which takes the number of nodes and the adjacency matrix as input, constructs a quantum walk operator and applies QPE to estimate its eigenvalues. These eigenvalues reveal the graph's structural properties, enabling us to determine its completeness. We establish a relationship between the number of nodes in a complete graph and the number of marked nodes, optimizing the success probability and running time. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log^2n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. offering a clear quantum advantage over classical methods. This approach is useful in network structure analysis, evaluating classical routing algorithms, and assessing systems based on pairwise comparisons.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a quantum circuit construction that combines classical random sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. Additionally, supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

Abstract: We develop squeezing protocols to enhance cross-Kerr interactions. We show that through alternating between squeezing along different quadratures of a single photonic mode, the cross-Kerr interaction strength can be generically amplified. As an application of the squeezing protocols we discuss speeding up the deterministic implementation of controlled phase gates in photonic quantum computing architectures. We develop bounds that characterize how fast and strong single-mode squeezing has to be applied to achieve a desired gate error and show that the protocols can overcome photon losses. Finally, we discuss experimental realizations of the squeezing strategies in optical fibers and nanophotonic waveguides.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the well-known Tavis-Cummings (TC) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), we introduce a method for quantum-mechanically simulating the dynamics of experimental masers beyond the mean-field approximation (MFA) that takes into account the spatial variation of the a.c. magnetic field of the maser's amplified microwave mode across its gain medium. The distribution in the coupling between the amplified mode and the medium's very large number (typically $10^{17}$) of spatially distributed quantum emitters can be determined straightforwardly for a given geometry and composition using an electromagnetic-field solver. Upon discretising this distribution as a histogram over a small finite number of bins, we assign -- as an approximation -- the same coupling to all emitters that fall within the same bin, where the value of this coupling equals the center value of the bin's range. With our approximate Hamiltonian arranged as a weighted sum over these bins, we generate expressions for expectation values of operators in the Heisenberg picture to second order in cumulant expansion, using the publicly available QuantumCumulants.jl package in Julia. For ten evenly spaced bins, our model, which can be run on a laptop computer, is used to simulate the recorded output from an experimental maser with a pentacene-doped para-terphenyl gain medium. We find that it replicates the quantum-mechanical features of the measured maser's dynamics, in particular its damped collective Rabi oscillations, more closely than the standard TC model under the MFA can, with an $R^2$ value of 0.774, as opposed to 0.265. Our model should thus aid the quantitative engineering of improved, optimised maser designs.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) in its analog form using a neutral atom quantum processing unit to solve the Maximum Independent Set problem. The analog QAOA leverages the natural encoding of problem Hamiltonians by Rydberg atom interactions, while employing Bayesian Optimisation to navigate the quantum-classical parameter space effectively under the constraints of hardware noise and resource limitations. We evaluate the approach through a combination of simulations and experimental runs on Pasqal's first commercial quantum processing unit, Orion Alpha, demonstrating effective parameter optimisation and noise mitigation strategies, such as selective bitstring discarding and detection error corrections. Results show that a limited number of measurements still allows for a quick convergence to a solution, making it a viable solution for resource-efficient scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. Stabilizer codes, including surface code and color code, have long been the focus of research and have seen significant experimental progress in recent years. Recently proposed time-dynamical QEC, including Floquet codes and generalized time-dynamical code implementations, opens up new opportunities for FT quantum computation. By employing a periodic schedule of low-weight parity checks, Floquet codes can generate additional dynamical logical qubits, offering enhanced error correction capabilities and potentially higher code performance. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states, and stabilize these states using repeated error detection. We showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. Furthermore, by implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for resource-efficient FT quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Wigner functions help visualise quantum states and dynamics while supporting quantitative analysis in quantum information. In the discrete setting, many inequivalent constructions coexist for each Hilbert-space dimension. This fragmentation obscures which features are fundamental and which are artefacts of representation. We introduce a stencil-based framework that exhausts all possible $d\times d$ discrete Wigner functions for a single $d$-dimensional quantum system (including a novel one for even $d$), subsuming known forms. We also give explicit invertible linear maps between definitions within the same $d$, enabling direct comparison of operational properties and exposing representation dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Majorana Propagation, an algorithmic framework for the classical simulation of Fermionic circuits. Inspired by Pauli Propagation, Majorana Propagation operates by applying successive truncations throughout the Heisenberg evolution of the observable. We identify monomial length as an effective truncation strategy for typical, unstructured circuits by proving that high-length Majorana monomials are exponentially unlikely to contribute to expectation values and the backflow of high-length monomials to lower-length monomials is quadratically suppressed. We provide performance guarantees by proving analytically that approximation errors decrease exponentially with the truncation threshold and that only polynomial resources are required to compute the expectation value of observables up to a fixed error for an ensemble of circuits relevant to quantum chemistry. Majorana Propagation can be used either independently, or in conjunction with quantum hardware, to simulate Fermionic systems relevant to quantum chemistry and condensed matter. We exemplify this by using Majorana Propagation to find circuits that approximate ground states for strongly correlated systems of up to 52 Fermionic modes. Our results indicate that Majorana Propagation is orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than state-of-the-art tensor-network-based circuit simulators.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum-neural hybrid imaginary time evolution</title>

Abstract: Numerous methodologies have been proposed to implement imaginary time evolution (ITE) on quantum computers. Among these, variational ITE (VITE) methods for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers have attracted much attention, which uses parametrized quantum circuits to mimic non-unitary dynamics. Although widely studied, conventional variational quantum algorithms including face challenges in achieving high accuracy due to their strong dependence on the choice of ansatz quantum circuits. Recently, the variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (VQNHE), which combines the neural network (NN) with a variational quantum eigensolver, has been proposed. This approach enhances the expressive power of variational states and improves the estimation of expectation values. Motivated by this idea, we explore the hybridization of VITE with a NN-based non-unitary operator. In this study, we propose a method named variational quantum-neural hybrid ITE (VQNHITE). By combining the NN and parameterized quantum circuit, our proposal enhances the expressive power compared to conventional approaches, enabling more accurate tracking of imaginary-time dynamics. In addition, to mitigate the instability arising from randomly initialized NN parameters, we introduce an initial-parameter optimization procedure at a small imaginary-time step, which stabilizes the subsequent variational evolution. We tested our approach with numerical simulations on Heisenberg spin chains under both nearest-neighbor and all-to-all circuit connectivities. The results demonstrate that VQNHITE consistently achieves higher fidelity with the exact ITE state compared to VITE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an ergotropy-based formulation of quantum thermodynamics, which provides a strong connection between average heat and von Neumann entropy. By adopting this formulation, we can reinterpret the infinitesimal average heat in terms of the infinitesimal change of the passive state associated with the density operator behind the quantum dynamics. Such as entropy, this leads to a heat concept that is invariant under passive state transformations. As an application, the average heat can be used as a general non-Markovianity measure for unital maps. Moreover, a positive-semidefinite temperature naturally emerges in an out-of-equilibrium ergotropy-based scenario. Concerning the infinitesimal average work, it arises as the infinitesimal variation of ergotropy, as well as an extra passive work contribution in the case of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As illustrations, we consider the thermodynamics of a single-qubit open system in the cases of generalized amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum dynamics in two-dimensional lattices with tensor network influence functional belief propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing nonequilibrium quantum dynamics remains a significant computational challenge due to the growth of spatial entanglement. The tensor network influence functional (TN-IF) approach mitigates this problem for computing the time evolution of local observables by encoding the subsystem's influence functional path integral as a matrix product state (MPS), thereby shifting the resource governing computational cost from spatial entanglement to temporal entanglement. We extend the applicability of the TN-IF method to two-dimensional lattices by demonstrating its construction on tree lattices and proposing a belief propagation (BP) algorithm for the TN-IF, termed influence functional BP (IF-BP), to simulate local observable dynamics on arbitrary graphs. Even though the BP algorithm introduces uncontrolled approximation errors on arbitrary graphs, it provides an accurate description for locally tree-like lattices. Numerical simulations of the kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice, motivated by a recent quantum experiment, highlight the effectiveness of the IF-BP method, which demonstrates superior performance in capturing long-time dynamics where traditional tensor network state-based methods struggle. Our results further reveal that the temporal entanglement entropy (TEE) only grows logarithmically with time for this model, resulting in a polynomial computational cost for the whole method. We further construct a cluster expansion of IF-BP to introduce loop correlations beyond the BP approximation, providing a systematic correction to the IF-BP estimate. We demonstrate the power of the cluster expansion of the IF-BP in simulating the quantum quench dynamics of the 2D transverse field Ising model, obtaining numerical results that improve on the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of thermalization in open quantum systems require a reliable representation of the bath correlation function (BCF). Numerical approaches, such as the hierarchical equations of motion and the pseudomode method, inherently approximate the BCF using a finite set of functions, which can impact simulation accuracy. In this work, we propose a practical and rigorous testing framework to assess the validity of approximate BCFs in open quantum dynamics simulations. Our approach employs a harmonic oscillator system, where the computed dynamics can be benchmarked against known exact solutions. To enable practical testing, we make two key methodological advancements. First, we develop numerical techniques to efficiently evaluate these exact solutions across a wide range of BCFs, ensuring broad applicability. Second, we introduce a moment-based state representation that significantly simplifies computations by exploiting the Gaussian nature of the system. Applications to a two-spin system and a transmon-resonator system demonstrate that our testing procedure provides error estimates that capture the qualitative trends observed in thermalization simulations. Using this methodology, we assess the performance of recently proposed BCF construction methods, highlighting both their strengths and a notable challenge posed by sub-Ohmic spectral densities at finite temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Quantum correlations of 3-beam symmetric Gaussian states are analyzed using their quantum universal invariants. These invariants, 1-, 2-, and 3-beam purities, are expressed in terms of the beams' intensity moments up to sixth order. The 3-beam symmetric Gaussian states with varying amounts of the noise are experimentally generated using entangled photon pairs from down-conversion, their invariants are determined, and their quantum correlations are quantified. The coexistence of bi- and tripartite entanglement and genuine tripartite entanglement are observed in these states that resemble the noisy GHZ/W states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonperturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) while it is possible to find regimes with genuine Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like tripartite entanglement, it is difficult find regimes where tripartite entanglement can be easily shown to be significant or classified. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field nonperturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the Unruh-DeWitt model. Along the way, we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a foundational resource in quantum information science, underpinning applications across physics. However, detecting and quantifying entanglement remains a significant challenge. In this article, we introduce a variational quantum algorithm inspired by Uhlmann's theorem to quantify the Bures entanglement of general quantum states, a method that naturally extends to other quantum resources, including genuine multipartite entanglement, quantum discord, quantum coherence, and total correlations, while also enabling reconstruction of the closest free states. The algorithm requires a polynomial number of ancillary qubits and circuit depth relative to the system size, dimensionality, and free state cardinality, making it scalable for practical implementations. Thus, it provides a versatile framework for quantifying quantum resources, demonstrated here through several applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of memory is a hallmark feature of non-Markovian dynamics. However, the type of memory -- classical or quantum -- required to realize certain dynamics remains unknown. We study the quantum homogenizer as a minimal model of non-Markovian evolution and identify the physical conditions under which genuinely quantum memory becomes necessary. Using entanglement measures and relying only on the local dynamics as a witness, we prove both analytically and numerically the type of memory depends not merely on the dynamics itself, but also on the reservoir's initial entanglement structure, and in particular the propagation of non-classical correlations within it. For different bi- or multi-partite reservoir initializations, we establish a correspondence between interaction strength and entanglement generation. We provide physical criteria and an activation lower bound for the onset of quantum memory. The results may inform us how environmental correlations govern the transition from classical to quantum memory in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, but subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently a parametric exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family must be extended.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the role of functionals of generalized fidelity measures in deriving quantum speed limits (QSLs) within a geometric approach. We establish a general theoretical framework and show that, once a specific generalized fidelity is selected, the resulting Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm QSLs for both unitary and nonunitary (Lindblad-type) dynamics depend solely on the chosen fidelity measure. We prove that any monotone, differentiable reparametrization of the chosen fidelity yields exactly the same Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm-type QSL, rendering the QSLs invariant under such transformations and thereby unifying fidelity- and metric-induced geometric formulations. This result highlights the limitations of improving QSLs through functional transformations of fidelity and indicates that genuine improvements must arise from alternative fidelity definitions. We further show that several QSLs reported in the literature are encompassed by our framework and discuss possible extensions based on other generalized fidelity measures beyond those explicitly analyzed. In addition, we consider the damped Jaynes-Cummings model as a concrete physical setting to explore the behavior of the QSLs discussed in this work and analyze their regime-dependent features.</description>

      <title>Triple-Tone Microwave Control for Sensitivity Optimization in Compact Ensemble Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a well-established platform for quantum magnetometry under ambient conditions. One challenge arises from the hyperfine structure of the NV, which, for the common $^{14}$N isotope, results in a threefold reduction of contrast and thus sensitivity. By addressing each of the NV hyperfine transitions individually, triple-tone microwave (MW) control can mitigate this sensitivity loss. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the regimes in which triple-tone excitation offers an advantage over standard single-tone MW control for two DC magnetometry protocols: pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Ramsey interferometry. We validate a master equation model of the NV dynamics against ensemble NV measurements, and use the model to explore triple-tone vs single-tone sensitivity for different MW powers and NV dephasing rates. For pulsed ODMR, triple-tone driving improves sensitivity by up to a factor of three in the low-dephasing regime, with diminishing gains when dephasing rates approach the hyperfine splitting. In contrast, for Ramsey interferometry, triple-tone excitation only improves sensitivity if MW power is limited. Our results delineate the operating regimes where triple-tone control provides a practical strategy for enhancing NV ensemble magnetometry in portable and power-limited sensors.</description>

      <title>How typical is contextuality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying when observed statistics cannot be explained by any reasonable classical model is a central problem in quantum foundations. A principled and universally applicable approach to defining and identifying nonclassicality is given by the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Here, we study the typicality of contextuality -- namely, the likelihood that randomly chosen quantum preparations and measurements produce nonclassical statistics. Using numerical linear programs to test for the existence of a generalized-noncontextual model, we find that contextuality is fairly common: even in experiments with only a modest number of random preparations and measurements, contextuality arises with probability over 99%. We also show that while typicality of contextuality decreases as the purity (sharpness) of the preparations (measurements) decreases, this dependence is not especially pronounced, so contextuality is fairly typical even in settings with realistic noise. Finally, we show that although nonzero contextuality is quite typical, quantitatively high degrees of contextuality are not as typical, and so large quantum advantages (like for parity-oblivious multiplexing, which we take as a case study) are not as typical. We provide an open-source toolbox that outputs the typicality of contextuality as a function of tunable parameters (such as lower and upper bounds on purity and other constraints on states and measurements). This toolbox can inform the design of experiments that achieve the desired typicality of contextuality for specified experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of Acceptable Defectiveness: Redefining Surface Code Robustness under Heterogeneous Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of past research on superconducting qubits shows that these devices exhibit considerable variation and thus cannot be accurately depicted by a uniform noise model. To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubit's physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Here, we present a simulation framework based on the stabilizer simulation package STIM, that allows for rapid experimentation of quantum error correction (QEC) performance under any arbitrary and unique noise model. Using this tool, QEC circuits using rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $\leq 0.75$, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. Additionally, when modeling noise as a uniform distribution, the logical error rate shows minimal impact with increasing deviation, with $\sigma \leq \mu$. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity relates to the logical error rate and, through the framework provided, facilitates the development of preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet to achieve target logical performance with imperfect or nonuniform qubit qualities.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism in tilted fermionic Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetism in tilted fermionic Mott insulators. With a small tilt, the fermions are still localized and form a Mott-insulating state, where the localized spins interact via antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. While the localized state is naively expected to be broken with a large tilt, in fact, the fermions are still localized under a large tilt due to the Wannier-Stark localization and it can be regarded as a localized spin system. We find that the sign of the exchange coupling is changed and the ferromagnetic interaction is realized under the large tilt. To show this, we employ perturbation theory and real-time numerical simulation of the fermionic Hubbard chain. Our simulation exhibits that it is possible to effectively control the speed and time direction of the dynamics by changing the size of the tilt, which may be useful for experimentally measuring out-of-time-ordered correlators. Finally, we discuss experimental platforms, such as ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, to observe these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Approximate Degradability of High-Spin Modified Landau-Streater Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the degradability of quantum channels in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, focusing on the Modified Landau-Streater (MLS) channels constructed from SU(2) spin-$j$ representations. While the super-additivity of coherent information generally renders quantum capacity calculations intractable, approximate degradability provides a path to tight lower bounds. Extending the analysis of qubit depolarizing channels by Leditzky et al., we rigorously establish that the MLS family exhibits an $O(p^2)$ approximate degradability parameter for arbitrary dimension $d = 2j+1$. A pivotal contribution of our work is the geometric characterization of the noise structure: we establish that the diamond norm distance between the pure Landau-Streater channel and the identity channel is exactly $2$. We identify this geometric orthogonality between the noise and signal subspaces as the physical mechanism responsible for canceling the first-order non-degradability terms. These results suggest that $O(p^2)$ degradability is a robust feature of highly symmetric noise models, paving the way for a deeper structural understanding of quantum capacity in high-dimensional regimes.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state. We demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and does not depend explicitly on the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description>

      <title>Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet with a potential defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central potential barrier or well. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing potential barrier heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the potential well, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for potential barriers as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of potential wells. The presence of selective excitation processes emanating from quantum superposition in the induced droplet dynamics is explicated by evaluating the contribution of the participating single-particle eigenstates. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Kondo-coupled van der Waals antiferromagnet with high-mobility quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature, arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches $\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection. Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus, CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising Kondo-coupled vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral-zeta framework for quantum mechanics with the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{{\cal PT}}(x)=x^{2K}(ix)^{\varepsilon}$ $(K,\varepsilon \in {\mathbb N})$ and the Hermitian potential $V_{{\cal H}}(x)=x^{2M}$ $(M \in {\mathbb N}+1)$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system. Using the ODE/IM correspondence, we construct exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for the spectral zeta functions (SZFs) $\zeta_n(s)$. In contrast to recursive T-Q relations, the ZGFs provide fixed-source, closed-form mappings between different fusion sectors. For Hermitian $M=2$, our ESRs reproduce exact WKB results, extending them systematically to ${\cal PT}$ sectors and (half-)integer $M$. Our analysis reveals a phenomenon of \textit{algebraic information loss}, distinct from analytic ambiguity. The structure is governed by a selection rule ${\cal S}_n$, derived from the Chebyshev structure of fusion relations and $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik symmetry. For odd integer $M$, we identify a structural non-invertibility: mapping from \textit{odd} to \textit{even} fusion sectors causes exact coefficient cancellation due to phase interference, rendering the map non-invertible. This implies even-sector data carry strictly less information than odd-sector data, yielding a \textit{no-go} statement for inverse spectral reconstruction. Conversely, for even and half-integer $M$, all relevant sectors form an information-equivalent, mutually invertible family. Finally, we provide a spectral-zeta formulation of the massless Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS) conjecture. By connecting ${\cal PT}$ and Hermitian spectra via ZGFs, we establish a purely spectral-theoretic route to the conjectured relation, avoiding explicit analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing energy conversion with nonthermal resources in steady-state quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length using a perturbative expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results introduce stealthy disorder into quantum tight-binding models and show that enforcing a low-$k$ spectral gap markedly alters the scattering landscape, enabling localization lengths that exceed the system size at fixed disorder strength. Since this mechanism relies only on the spectral properties of the disorder, it carries over directly to photonic and phononic wave systems.</description>

      <title>Photonic Exceptional Points in Holography and QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>
