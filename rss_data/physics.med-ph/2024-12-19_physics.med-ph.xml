      <title>Optimisation of Magnetic Field Sensing with Optically Pumped Magnetometers for Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography is a novel technique that could enable non-invasive imaging of fast neural activity in the brain. However, commercial magnetometers are not suited to its technical requirements. Computational modelling was used to determine the optimal number, size and orientation of magnetometers, to inform the future development of MDEIT-specific magnetometers. Images were reconstructed using three sensing axes, arrays of 16 to 160 magnetometers, and cell sizes ranging from 1 to 18 mm. Image quality was evaluated visually and with the weighted spatial variance. Single-axis measurements normal to the surface provided the best image quality, and image quality increased with an increase in sensor number and size. This study can inform future OPM design, showing the size of the vapour cell need not be constrained to that of commercially available OPMs, and that a small array of single-axis, highly sensitive sensors is optimal for MDEIT.</description>

      <title>Spatial Brain Tumor Concentration Estimation for Individualized Radiotherapy Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical modeling of brain tumors has emerged as a promising strategy for personalizing radiotherapy planning by estimating the otherwise hidden distribution of tumor cells within the brain. However, many existing state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive, limiting their widespread translation into clinical practice. In this work, we propose an efficient and direct method that utilizes soft physical constraints to estimate the tumor cell concentration from preoperative MRI of brain tumor patients. Our approach optimizes a 3D tumor concentration field by simultaneously minimizing the difference between the observed MRI and a physically informed loss function. Compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, our method significantly improves predicting tumor recurrence on two public datasets with a total of 192 patients while maintaining a clinically viable runtime of under one minute - a substantial reduction from the 30 minutes required by the current best approach. Furthermore, we showcase the generalizability of our framework by incorporating additional imaging information and physical constraints, highlighting its potential to translate to various medical diffusion phenomena with imperfect data.</description>

      <title>Indirect Zero Field NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study pioneers the two-field correlation spectroscopy (COSY) in zero to ultralow field (ZULF) liquid state NMR, employing hyperpolarized [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate as a model system. We demonstrate the successful integration of signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) for hyperpolarization, enabling the detection of ZULF COSY spectra with increased sensitivity. The use of field cycling allows the acquisition of two-field COSY spectra at varying magnetic field strengths, including zero-field conditions. This enables insight into both J-coupling and Zeeman-dominated regimes benefiting from ULF field observation sensitivity and mitigation of low-frequency noise by conducting readout at higher fields (&gt;5 $\mu$T). Our study explores the effects of polarization transfer, apodization techniques, and the potential for further application of ZULF NMR in chemical analysis exemplified for three X-nuclei and three corresponding molecules: [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate, [$^{15}$N]acetonitrile and [3-$^{19}$F]pyridine. These findings pave the way for more sensitive and cost-effective NMR spectroscopy in low-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule in situ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains challenging to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both the tension and elastic modulus of lens tissue and capsule. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. Young's modulus (E) was 1.9 MPa for anterior capsules and 1.2 MPa for posterior capsules. Tensions in cortical tissue (E ~ 10 kPa) were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension from near zero to 64 kPa. This acousto-optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure X-ray dark-field imaging via a dual-energy propagation-based setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray dark-field imaging visualises scattering from sample microstructure, and has found application in medical and security contexts. While most X-ray dark-field imaging techniques rely on masks, gratings, or crystals, recent work on the Fokker--Planck model of diffusive imaging has enabled dark-field imaging in the propagation-based geometry. Images captured at multiple propagation distances or X-ray energies can be used to reconstruct dark-field from propagation-based images but have previously required multiple exposures. Here, we show single-exposure dark-field imaging by exploiting the harmonic content in a monochromatised synchrotron beam and utilising an energy-discriminating photon-counting detector to capture dual-energy propagation-based images. The method is validated by filming time-varying samples, showing the advantage of the dark-field contrast in analysing dynamic evolution. We measure and adjust for the impact of detector charge-sharing on the images. This work opens the way for low-dose and dynamic dark-field X-ray imaging without the need for a high-stability set-up and precision optics.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mesoscopic Larmor Frequency Shifts in White Matter with Diffusion MRI -- A Monte-Carlo Study in axonal phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to validate if MRI can measure anisotropic mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts from white matter axonal microstructure relative to the B0 direction and if dMRI can estimate this anisotropy. Recent models describe how mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons, described by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show MRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its orientation dependence.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Image Reconstruction Regularized with Inter-Spectral Structural Similarity for Limited-Angle Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Limited-angle (LA) dual-energy (DE) cone-beam CT (CBCT) is considered as a potential solution to achieve fast and low-dose DE imaging on current CBCT scanners without hardware modification. However, its clinical implementations are hindered by the challenging image reconstruction from LA projections. While optimization-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for image reconstruction, their utilization is limited by the requirement for X-ray spectra measurement or paired datasets for model training.
  Purpose: This work aims to facilitate the clinical applications of fast and low-dose DECBCT by developing a practical solution for image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT.
  Methods: An inter-spectral structural similarity-based regularization was integrated into the iterative image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT. By enforcing the similarity between the DE images, LA artifacts were efficiently reduced in the reconstructed DECBCT images. The proposed method was evaluated using four physical phantoms and three digital phantoms, demonstrating its efficacy in quantitative DECBCT imaging.
  Conclusions: The proposed method achieves accurate image reconstruction without the need for X-ray spectra measurement for optimization or paired datasets for model training, showing great practical value in clinical implementations of LA-DECBCT.</description>

      <title>Biological and Radiological Dictionary of Radiomics Features: Addressing Understandable AI Issues in Personalized Prostate Cancer; Dictionary Version PM1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between visual semantic features defined in PI-RADS and associated risk factors, moving beyond abnormal imaging findings, establishing a shared framework between medical and AI professionals by creating a standardized dictionary of biological/radiological RFs. Subsequently, 6 interpretable and seven complex classifiers, linked with nine interpretable feature selection algorithms (FSA) applied to risk factors, were extracted from segmented lesions in T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) multiparametric-prostate MRI sequences to predict the UCLA scores. We then utilized the created dictionary to interpret the best-predictive models. Combining T2WI, DWI, and ADC with FSAs including ANOVA F-test, Correlation Coefficient, and Fisher Score, and utilizing logistic regression, identified key features: The 90th percentile from T2WI, which captures hypo-intensity related to prostate cancer risk; Variance from T2WI, indicating lesion heterogeneity; shape metrics including Least Axis Length and Surface Area to Volume ratio from ADC, describing lesion shape and compactness; and Run Entropy from ADC, reflecting texture consistency. This approach achieved the highest average accuracy of 0.78, significantly outperforming single-sequence methods (p-value&lt;0.05). The developed dictionary for Prostate-MRI (PM1.0) serves as a common language, fosters collaboration between clinical professionals and AI developers to advance trustworthy AI solutions that support reliable/interpretable clinical decisions.</description>
