      <title>Surprising Spin-orbit Resonances of Rocky Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works suggest that, in multiplanetary systems, a close-in exoplanet can sometimes avoid becoming tidally locked to its host star if it is captured into a secular spin-orbit resonance with a companion planet. In such a resonance, the planet remains at a sub-synchronous spin rate and an appreciable obliquity (the planet's spin-orbit misalignment angle). However, many of these works have only considered planets with fluid-like rheologies. Recent observations suggest that planets up to a few Earth masses may be rocky and thus may have an appreciable rigidity. In this work, we study the spin-orbit dynamics of such rigid planets using a linear dissipative tidal model and not enforcing principal axis rotation about the body's shortest principal axis. We identify a new class of spin-orbit resonances when the planet spins at twice its orbital frequency. These resonances exist at nonzero obliquity and spontaneously excite non-principal-axis rotation upon resonance capture. While these resonances eventually disappear as tidal dissipation damps the obliquity to zero (and the body returns to principal-axis rotation), they still modify the spin evolutionary history of the planet. Such resonances may enhance the prevalence of secular spin-orbit resonances in exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>A long spin period for a sub-Neptune-mass exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIP 41378 f is a sub-Neptune exoplanet with an anomalously low density. Its long orbital period and deep transit make it an ideal candidate for detecting oblateness photometrically. We present a new cross-platform, GPU-enabled code greenlantern, suitable for computing transit light curves of oblate planets at arbitrary orientations. We then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit K2 data of HIP 41378 b, d, and f, specifically examining HIP 41378 f for possible oblateness and obliquity. We find that the flattening of HIP 41378 f is $f \leq 0.18$ at the 95% confidence level, consistent with a rotation period of $P_\text{rot} \geq 22.2$ hr. In the future, high-precision data from JWST has the potential to tighten such a constraint and can differentiate between spherical and flattened planets.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity to initial conditions of the Co-orbital outcomes of Lunar Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lunar ejecta, produced by meteoroidal impacts, have been proposed for the origin of the near-Earth asteroid (469219) Kamo'oalewa, supported by its unusually Earth-like orbit and L-type reflectance spectrum (Sharkey et al., 2021). In a recent study (Castro-Cisneros et al. 2023), we found with N-body numerical simulations that the orbit of Kamo'oalewa is dynamically compatible with rare pathways of lunar ejecta captured into Earth's co-orbital region, persistently transitioning between horseshoe and quasi-satellite (HS-QS) states. Subsequently, Jiao et al. (2024) found with hydrodynamic and N-body simulations that the geologically young lunar crater Giordano Bruno generated up to 300 Kamo'oalewa-sized escaping fragments, and up to three of those could have become Earth co-orbitals. However, these results are based upon specific initial conditions of the major planets in the Solar System, close to the current epoch. In particular, over megayear time spans, Earth's eccentricity undergoes excursions up to five times its current value, potentially affecting the chaotic orbital evolution of lunar ejecta and their capture into Earth's co-orbital regions. In the present work, we carry out additional numerical simulations to compute the statistics of co-orbital outcomes across different launch epochs, representative of the full range of Earth's eccentricity values. Our main results are as follows: Kamo'oalewa-like co-orbital outcomes of lunar ejecta vary only slightly across the range of Earth's orbital eccentricity, suggesting no privileged ejecta launching epoch for such objects; the probability of co-orbital outcomes decreases rapidly with increasing launch speed, but long-lived HS-QS states are favored at higher launch speeds.</description>

      <title>Mind the kinematics simulation of planet-disk interactions: time evolution and numerical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-disk interactions can produce kinematic signatures in protoplanetary disks. While recent observations have detected non-Keplerian gas motions in disks, their origins are still being debated. To explore this, we conduct 3D hydrodynamic simulations using the code FARGO3D to study non-axisymmetric kinematic perturbations at 2 scale heights induced by Jovian planets in protoplanetary disks, followed by examinations of detectable signals in synthetic CO emission line observations at millimeter wavelengths. We advocate for using residual velocity or channel maps, generated by subtracting an azimuthally averaged background of the disk, to identify planet-induced kinematic perturbations. We investigate the effects of two basic simulation parameters, simulation duration and numerical resolution, on the simulation results. Our findings suggest that a short simulation (e.g., 100 orbits) is insufficient to establish a steady velocity pattern given our chosen viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-3}$), and displays plenty of fluctuations on orbital timescale. Such transient features could be detected in observations. By contrast, a long simulation (e.g., 1,000 orbits) is required to reach steady state in kinematic structures. At 1,000 orbits, the strongest and detectable velocity structures are found in the spiral wakes close to the planet. Through numerical convergence tests, we find hydrodynamics results converge in spiral regions at a resolution of 14 cells per disk scale height (CPH) or higher. Meanwhile, synthetic observations produced from hydrodynamic simulations at different resolutions are indistinguishable with 0.1$^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution and 10 hours of integration time on ALMA.</description>

      <title>The Polar Vortex Hypothesis: Evolving, Spectrally Distinct Polar Regions Explain Short- and Long-term Light Curve Evolution and Color-Inclination Trends in Brown Dwarfs and Giant Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies revealed viewing-angle-dependent color and spectral trends in brown dwarfs, as well as long-term photometric variability (~100 hr). The origins of these trends are yet unexplained. Here, we propose that these seemingly unrelated sets of observations stem from the same phenomenon: The polar regions of brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets are spectrally different from lower-latitude regions, and that they evolve over longer timescales, possibly driven by polar vortices. We explore this hypothesis via a spatio-temporal atmosphere model capable of simulating time-series, disk-integrated spectra of ultracool atmospheres. We study three scenarios with different spectral and temporal components: A null hypothesis without polar vortex, and two scenarios with polar vortices. We find that the scenarios with polar vortex can explain the observed infrared color-inclination trend and the variability amplitude-inclination trend. The presence of spectrally distinct, time-evolving polar regions in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanet atmospheres raises the possibility that one-dimensional, static atmospheric models may be insufficient for reproducing ultracool atmospheres in detail.</description>

      <title>In-situ crystallographic mapping constrains sulfate deposition and timing in Jezero crater, Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Late-stage Ca-sulfate-filled fractures are common on Mars. Notably, the Shenandoah formation in the western edge of Jezero crater preserves a variety of Ca-sulfate minerals in the fine-grained siliciclastic rocks explored by the Perseverance rover. However, the depositional environment and timing of the formation of these sulfates is unknown. To address this outstanding problem, we developed a new technique to map the crystal textures of these sulfates in situ at two stratigraphically similar locations in the Shenandoah formation, allowing us to constrain the burial depth and paleoenvironment at the time of their deposition. Our results suggest that some Ca-sulfate analyzed was formed at a burial depth greater than 80m, whereas Ca-sulfates present at another outcrop likely precipitated in a shallow-subsurface environment. These results indicate that samples collected for potential return to Earth at the two studied locations capture two different times and distinct chemical conditions in the depositional history of the Shenandoah formation providing multiple opportunities to evaluate surface and subsurface habitability.</description>

      <title>Outbursts Upon Cooling of Low-Temperature Binary Mixtures: Experiments and Their Planetary Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many binary mixtures, the three-phase solid-liquid-vapor equilibrium curve has intermediate pressures that are higher than the pressure at the two pure triple points. This curve shape results in a negative slope in the high-temperature region near the triple point of the less volatile component. When freezing mixtures in the negative slope regime, fluid trapped below confined ice has latent heat released with more vapor upon cooling, and thus increases in pressure. If the rising pressure of the confined fluid overcomes the strength of the confining solid, which may be its own ice, it can produce an abrupt outburst of material and an increase in the system's overall pressure. Here, we report experimental results of freezing-induced outbursts occurring in the N2/CH4, CO/CH4, and N2/C2H6 systems, and provide insight into the phenomenon through a thermodynamics perspective. We also propose other binary systems that may experience outbursts and explore the geological implications for icy worlds like Titan, Triton, Pluto and Eris, as well as rocky bodies, specifically Earth and Mars.</description>

      <title>Gaia-4b and 5b: Radial Velocity Confirmation of Gaia Astrometric Orbital Solutions Reveal a Massive Planet and a Brown Dwarf Orbiting Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia astrometry of nearby stars is precise enough to detect the tiny displacements induced by substellar companions, but radial velocity data are needed for definitive confirmation. Here we present radial velocity follow-up observations of 28 M and K stars with candidate astrometric substellar companions, which led to the confirmation of two systems, Gaia-4b and Gaia-5b, and the refutation of 21 systems as stellar binaries. Gaia-4b is a massive planet ($M = 11.8 \pm 0.7 \:\mathrm{M_J}$) in a $P = 571.3 \pm 1.4\:\mathrm{day}$ orbit with a projected semi-major axis $a_0=0.312 \pm 0.040\:\mathrm{mas}$ orbiting a $0.644 \pm 0.02 \:\mathrm{M_\odot}$ star. Gaia-5b is a brown dwarf ($M = 20.9 \pm 0.5\:\mathrm{M_J}$) in a $P = 358.58 \pm 0.19\:\mathrm{days}$ eccentric $e=0.6412 \pm 0.0027$ orbit with a projected angular semi-major axis of $a_0 = 0.947 \pm 0.038\:\mathrm{mas}$ around a $0.34 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ star. Gaia-4b is one of the first exoplanets discovered via the astrometric technique, and is one of the most massive planets known to orbit a low-mass star.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen transport in protoplanetary disks by ammonium salts: a possible origin of Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric compositions preserve the history of planet formation processes. Jupiter has the remarkable feature of being uniformly enriched in various elements compared to the Sun, including highly volatile elements such as nitrogen and noble gases. Radial transport of volatile species by amorphous ice in the solar nebula is one mechanism that explains Jupiter's volatile enrichment, but the low entrapment efficiency of nitrogen into amorphous ice is an issue. We propose an alternative mechanism of delivering nitrogen to Jupiter: radial transport of semi-volatile ammonium salts in the solar nebula. Ammonium salts have been identified in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and can potentially compensate for the comet's nitrogen depletion compared to the Sun. We simulate the radial transport and dissociation of ammonium salts carried by dust in a protoplanetary disk, followed by the accretion of the gas and NH$_3$ vapor by a protoplanet, as well as the delivery of nitrogen to the planetary atmosphere from the salt-containing planetary core that undergoes dilution. We find that when the dust contains 10-30 wt% ammonium salts, the production of NH$_3$ vapor in the inner disk (~ 3 au) by dissociated salts and the incorporation of the salt-derived NH$_3$ through core formation and subsequent gas accretion by the protoplanet result in a planetary nitrogen enrichment consistent with the observations of Jupiter. Ammonium salts may thus play a vital role in developing the atmospheric composition of planets forming in the inner disk. Combining our model with future observations of the bulk compositions and isotopes of comets and other primordial bodies will help to further elucidate the elemental transport to the gas giants and ice giants in the solar system.</description>

      <title>Dust Drift Timescales in Protoplanetary Disks at the Cusp of Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter emitting dust grains have sizes that make them susceptible to drift in protoplanetary disks due to a difference between their orbital speed and that of the gas. The characteristic drift timescale depends on the surface density of the gas. By comparing disk radii measurements from ALMA CO and continuum observations at millimeter wavelengths, the gas surface density profile and dust drift time can be self-consistently determined. We find that profiles which match the measured dust mass have very short drift timescales, an order of magnitude or more shorter than the stellar age, whereas profiles for disks that are on the cusp of gravitational instability, defined via the minimum value of the Toomre parameter, Qmin ~ 1-2, have drift timescales comparable to the stellar lifetime. This holds for disks with masses of dust &gt; 5 MEarth across a range of absolute ages from less than 1 Myr to over 10 Myr. The inferred disk masses scale with stellar mass as Mdisk ~ Mstar / 5Qmin. This interpretation of the gas and dust disk sizes simultaneously solves two long standing issues regarding the dust lifetime and exoplanet mass budget and suggests that we consider millimeter wavelength observations as a window into an underlying population of particles with a wide size distribution in secular evolution with a massive planetesimal disk.</description>

Abstract: Comets, asteroids and moons that orbit stars and planets exterior to our solar system are prefixed with "exo". While the existence of these objects is certain, our understanding of their physical properties, composition, and diversity is still in its infancy, especially when compared to similar objects within our own solar system. This chapter introduces the topics of exocomets, exoasteroids, and exomoons, putting in context three emerging subfields in astronomy that, despite being relatively small, have experienced rapid growth over the past decade.</description>

      <title>Rotation state, colors, and albedo of the mission-accessible tiny near-Earth asteroid 2001 QJ$_{142}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Characterizing mission-accessible asteroids using telescopic observations is fundamental for target-selection and planning for spacecraft missions. Near-Earth asteroids on Earth-like orbits are of particular importance for applications such as asteroid mining. Aims. 2001 QJ142 is a tiny (D $\leq$ 100 m) near-Earth asteroid on an Earth-like orbit with a semimajor axis of 1.06 au, orbital eccentricity of 0.09, and orbital inclination of 3.10$^{\circ}$. We aim to characterize 2001 QJ142 using ground-based observations with future spacecraft missions in mind. Methods. We performed visible multicolor photometry of 2001 QJ142 using the TriCCS on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope in February 2024. We also revisited the images taken with the Suprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope in August 2012. Results. Visible color indices of 2001 QJ142 indicate that 2001 QJ142 is a C- or X-complex asteroid. We detect a possible fast rotation with a period of about 10 min, which is consistent with a previous report. The geometric albedo of 2001 QJ142 is derived to be about 0.3 from a slope of its photometric phase curve, which is consistent with an albedo derived from thermal observations with updated physical quantities. A straightforward interpretation is that 2001 QJ142 is either an E- or M-type asteroid, although surface properties of such tiny fast-rotating asteroids are not well understood. Conclusions. We infer that 2001 QJ142 is a fast-rotating mission-accessible E- or M-type near-Earth asteroid. More characterizations of tiny asteroids are particularly important for a deeper understanding of their nature.</description>

Abstract: Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure. Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes. Surveying 43 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar, novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin (depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across a broader wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Strong Nongravitational Accelerations and the Potential for Misidentification of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nongravitational accelerations in the absence of observed activity have recently been identified on NEOs, opening the question of the prevalence of anisotropic mass-loss in the near-Earth environment. Motivated by the necessity of nongravitational accelerations to identify 2010 VL$_{65}$ and 2021 UA$_{12}$ as a single object, we investigate the problem of linking separate apparitions in the presence of nongravitational perturbations. We find that nongravitational accelerations on the order of $10^{-9}$ au/d$^2$ can lead to a change in plane-of-sky positions of $\sim10^3$ arcsec between apparitions. Moreover, we inject synthetic tracklets of hypothetical nongravitationally-accelerating NEOs into the Minor Planet Center orbit identification algorithms. We find that at large nongravitational accelerations ($|A_i|\geq10^{-8}$ au/d$^2$) these algorithms fail to link a significant fraction of these tracklets. We further show that if orbits can be determined for both apparitions, the tracklets will be linked regardless of nongravitational accelerations, although they may be linked to multiple objects. In order to aid in the identification and linkage of nongravitationally accelerating objects, we propose and test a new methodology to search for unlinked pairs. When applied to the current census of NEOs, we recover the previously identified case but identify no new linkages. We conclude that current linking algorithms are generally robust to nongravitational accelerations, but objects with large nongravitational accelerations may potentially be missed. While current algorithms are well-positioned for the anticipated increase in the census population from future survey missions, it may be possible to find objects with large nongravitational accelerations hidden in isolated tracklet pairs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, as it can employ techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, gradient-based optimization, and other machine learning techniques. This new programming paradigm has motivated us to develop the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022). ExoJAX is designed to directly calculate cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure, rather than interpolating tabulated data, to minimize errors in high-dispersion spectra modeling. However, its application was primarily proof-of-concept and limited to narrowband high-dispersion emission spectroscopy. In this paper, we have enhanced the differentiable opacity calculation using a new fast and memory-efficient algorithm, and have developed differentiable radiative transfer schemes, including emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. These enhancements significantly expand the range of applications, as demonstrated through actual atmospheric retrievals: high-dispersion emission spectra of the brown dwarf GL229 B, medium-dispersion transmission spectra of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b from JWST, and high-dispersion reflection spectra of Jupiter. We obtained a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrained WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular fine structures at original resolution ($R \sim 3,000$), and estimated Jupiter's metallicity consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Estimating Exoplanet Mass using Machine Learning on Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoplanet archive is an incredible resource of information on the properties of discovered extrasolar planets, but statistical analysis has been limited by the number of missing values. One of the most informative bulk properties is planet mass, which is particularly challenging to measure with more than 70\% of discovered planets with no measured value. We compare the capabilities of five different machine learning algorithms that can utilize multidimensional incomplete datasets to estimate missing properties for imputing planet mass. The results are compared when using a partial subset of the archive with a complete set of six planet properties, and where all planet discoveries are leveraged in an incomplete set of six and eight planet properties. We find that imputation results improve with more data even when the additional data is incomplete, and allows a mass prediction for any planet regardless of which properties are known. Our favored algorithm is the newly developed $k$NN$\times$KDE, which can return a probability distribution for the imputed properties. The shape of this distribution can indicate the algorithm's level of confidence, and also inform on the underlying demographics of the exoplanet population. We demonstrate how the distributions can be interpreted with a series of examples for planets where the discovery was made with either the transit method, or radial velocity method. Finally, we test the generative capability of the $k$NN$\times$KDE to create a large synthetic population of planets based on the archive, and identify potential categories of planets from groups of properties in the multidimensional space. All codes are Open Source.</description>

      <title>Effect of different stickiness between icy and silicate particles on carbon depletion in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth and other rocky bodies in the inner Solar System are significantly depleted in carbon compared to the Sun and interstellar medium (ISM) dust. Observations indicate that over half of carbon in the ISM and comets is in refractory forms, like amorphous hydrocarbons and complex organics, which can be building blocks of rocky bodies. While amorphous hydrocarbons are destroyed by photolysis and oxidation, radial transport of solid particles can limit carbon depletion, except when complex organics, which are less refractory, are the main carbon source. We aim to identify conditions for severe carbon depletion in the inner Solar System by introducing more realistic factors: differences in stickiness between icy and silicate particles, and high-temperature regions in the disk's upper optically-thin layer, which were not considered in previous studies. We perform a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of radial drift and turbulent diffusion in a steady accretion disk, incorporating ice evaporation/re-condensation, photolysis/oxidation of hydrocarbons in the upper layer, and pyrolysis of complex organics. Our results show that the carbon fraction drops by two orders of magnitude inside the snow line under two conditions: i) silicate particles are much less sticky than icy particles, leading to a rapid decline in icy pebble flux while silicates accumulate inside the snow line, and ii) high-temperature regions in the disk's upper layer stir silicate particles into UV-exposed areas. These conditions reproduce carbon depletion patterns consistent with observations and allow for diverse carbon fractions in rocky bodies. This diversity may explain the wide variation of metals in white dwarf photospheres and suggest different surface environments for rocky planets in habitable zones.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. II. Understanding Prominence Eruption through Data-Driven Modeling and Observed Magnetic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EK Draconis, a nearby young solar-type star (G1.5V, 50-120 Myr), is known as one of the best proxies for inferring the environmental conditions of the young Sun. The star frequently produces superflares and Paper I presented the first evidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a blueshifted H$\alpha$ Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the results of dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its relationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed concurrently with the event. By performing a one-dimensional free-fall dynamical model and a one dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along the expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely occurred near the stellar limb (12$^{+5}_{-5}$-16$^{+7}_{-7}$ degrees from the limb) and was ejected at an angle of 15$^{+6}_{-5}$-24$^{+6}_{-6}$ degrees relative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a coronal mass ejection (CME). The observed prominence displayed a terminal velocity of $\sim$0 km s$^{-1}$ prior to disappearance, complicating the interpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest that prominence's H$\alpha$ intensity diminishes at around or before its expected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in observations. The TESS light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging revealed large mid-latitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar spot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the eruption. This suggests that mid-latitude spots could be the source of the pre-existing gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the environments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic programming methods for reconstruction of multichannel imaging detector events: ELVES and TRACK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for analyzing dynamic images registered by multichannel, highly sensitive detectors with low spatial but high temporal resolution. The principal characteristic of the approach is the absence of factorization of different types of information within the data set. For a number of rapidly changing (transient) phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, a probabilistic model can be formulated, and the parameters of this model can be reconstructed using probabilistic programming methods (Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo). This paper demonstrates the aforementioned approach on a number of examples, both simulated and actually registered by the detectors of the SINP MSU.
  In the case of submillisecond ELVES events registered by the orbital Mini-EUSO detector on board the ISS, the probabilistic model includes the coordinates and orientation of the lightning discharge that generated the glow, as well as the height of the ionized layer in which the glow is registered, among its parameters. Bayesian inference, implemented by means of the PyMC library, allows us to calculate posterior distributions for these parameters based on the times of signal peaks in individual detector channels.
  In addition to studying different types of aurora, the circumpolar system of ground-based multichannel PAIPS detectors also serves as a test-bench for probabilistic reconstruction algorithms. A wide class of track events is used for this purpose - meteors, satellite and aircraft passes, and the movement of stars across the sky. The Bayesian model includes both the parameters of the track event itself and the peculiarities of its registration. These methods can be generalized to stereo events (track registration by two detectors with overlapping fields of view) or applied to the reconstruction of extremely high energy cosmic rays in orbital fluorescence detectors.</description>

      <title>Ages of Stars and Planets in the Kepler Field Younger Than Four Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses of FGK stars in open clusters have helped clarify the precision with which a star's rotation rate and lithium content can be used as empirical indicators for its age. Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by Kepler. Rotation periods are drawn from previous work; lithium is measured from new and archival Keck/HIRES spectra. We report rotation-based ages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is applicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open clusters spanning 0.04-2.5 Gyr; they also agree with over 90% of the independent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than 1 Gyr at 2$\sigma$, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half the number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation history. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows that the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3-5 times rarer than stars 3 Gyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent stellar sample. We attribute this "demographic cliff" to a combination of kinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy's thin disk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from October 2022 through May 2024 as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Photon Background for Low-Noise Silicon Detectors in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future space observatories dedicated to direct imaging and spectroscopy of extra-solar planets will require ultra-low-noise detectors that are sensitive over a broad range of wavelengths. Silicon charge-coupled devices (CCDs), such as EMCCDs, Skipper CCDs, and Multi-Amplifier Sensing CCDs, have demonstrated the ability to detect and measure single photons from ultra-violet to near-infrared wavelengths, making them candidate technologies for this application. In this context, we study a relatively unexplored source of low-energy background coming from Cherenkov radiation produced by energetic charged particles traversing a silicon detector. In the intense radiation environment of space, energetic cosmic rays produce high-energy tracks and more extended halos of low-energy Cherenkov photons, which are detectable with ultra-low-noise detectors. We present a model of this effect that is calibrated to laboratory data, and we use this model to characterize the residual background rate for ultra-low noise silicon detectors in space. We find that the rate of cosmic-ray-induced Cherenkov photon production is comparable to other detector and astrophysical backgrounds that have previously been considered.</description>

      <title>An Alternating Minimization Algorithm with Trajectory for Direct Exoplanet Detection -- The AMAT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective image post-processing algorithms are vital for the successful direct imaging of exoplanets. Standard PSF subtraction methods use techniques based on a low-rank approximation to separate the rotating planet signal from the quasi-static speckles, and rely on signal-to-noise ratio maps to detect the planet. These steps do not interact or feed each other, leading to potential limitations in the accuracy and efficiency of exoplanet detection. We aim to develop a novel approach that iteratively finds the flux of the planet and the low-rank approximation of quasi-static signals, in an attempt to improve upon current PSF subtraction techniques. In this study, we extend the standard L2 norm minimization paradigm to an L1 norm minimization framework to better account for noise statistics in the high contrast images. Then, we propose a new method, referred to as Alternating Minimization Algorithm with Trajectory, that makes a more advanced use of estimating the low-rank approximation of the speckle field and the planet flux by alternating between them and utilizing both L1 and L2 norms. For the L1 norm minimization, we propose using L1 norm low-rank approximation, a low-rank approximation computed using an exact block-cyclic coordinate descent method, while we use randomized singular value decomposition for the L2 norm minimization. Additionally, we enhance the visibility of the planet signal using a likelihood ratio as a postprocessing step. Numerical experiments performed on a VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS dataset show the potential of AMAT to improve upon the existing approaches in terms of higher S/N, sensitivity limits, and ROC curves. Moreover, for a systematic comparison, we used datasets from the exoplanet data challenge to compare our algorithm to other algorithms in the challenge, and AMAT with likelihood ratio map performs better than most algorithms tested on the exoplanet data challenge.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Remnant Planetary Systems as a Function of Main-Sequence Mass with HST/COS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the descendants of stars with masses less than 8 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, white dwarfs provide a unique way to constrain planetary occurrence around intermediate-mass stars (spectral types BAF) that are otherwise difficult to measure with radial-velocity or transit surveys. We update the analysis of more than 250 ultraviolet spectra of hot ($13{,}000$ K $&lt; T_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt;$ $30{,}000$ K), young (less than $800$ Myr) white dwarfs collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, which reveals that more than 40% of all white dwarfs show photospheric silicon and sometimes carbon, signpost for the presence of remnant planetary systems. However, the fraction of white dwarfs with metals significantly decreases for massive white dwarfs (M$_{\rm WD}~&gt;$ 0.8 M$_{\odot}$), descendants of stars with masses greater than 3.5 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, as just $11^{+6}_{-4}$% exhibit metal pollution. In contrast, $44\pm6$% of a subset of white dwarfs (M$\rm _{WD}~&lt;$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$) unbiased by the effects of radiative levitation are actively accreting planetary debris. While the population of massive white dwarfs is expected to be influenced by the outcome of binary evolution, we do not find merger remnants to broadly affect our sample. We connect our measured occurrence rates of metal pollution on massive white dwarfs to empirical constraints into planetary formation and survival around stars with masses greater than 3.5 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence.</description>

      <title>JWST-IPA: Chemical Inventory and Spatial Mapping of Ices in the Protostar HOPS370 -- Evidence for an Opacity Hole and Thermal Processing of Ices</title>

Abstract: The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of $\sim$2.9 to 28 $\mu$m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution ($\sim 80$ au) maps of key volatile ice species H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, and OCN$^-$, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H$_{2}$O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H$_2$ and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>

      <title>Local stability of differential rotation in magnetised radiation zones and the solar tachocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study local magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities of differential rotation in magnetised, stably-stratified regions of stars and planets using a Cartesian Boussinesq model. We consider arbitrary latitudes and general shears (with gravity direction misaligned from this by an angle $\phi$), to model radial ($\phi=0$), latitudinal ($\phi=\pm 90^\circ$), and mixed differential rotations, and study both non-diffusive (including magnetorotational, MRI, and Solberg-H{\o}iland instabilities) and diffusive instabilities (including Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke, GSF, and MRI with diffusion). These instabilities could drive turbulent transport and mixing in radiative regions, including the solar tachocline and the cores of red giant stars, but their dynamics are incompletely understood. We revisit linear axisymmetric instabilities with and without diffusion and analyse their properties in the presence of magnetic fields, including deriving stability criteria and computing growth rates, wavevectors and energetics, both analytically and numerically. We present a more comprehensive analysis of axisymmetric local instabilities than prior work, exploring arbitrary differential rotations and diffusive processes. The presence of a magnetic field leads to stability criteria depending upon angular velocity rather than angular momentum gradients. We find MRI operates for much weaker differential rotations than the hydrodynamic GSF instability, and that it typically prefers much larger lengthscales, while the GSF instability is impeded by realistic strength magnetic fields. We anticipate MRI to be more important for turbulent transport in the solar tachocline than the GSF instability when $\phi&gt;0$ in the northern (and vice versa in the southern) hemisphere, though the latter could operate just below the convection zone when MRI is absent for $\phi&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition of planetary hosts: C, N, and $\alpha$-element abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of planet-hosting stars are crucial for characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation and evolution. Our objective is to uniformly determine the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and the $\alpha$-elements, magnesium and silicon, along with C/O, N/O and Mg/Si abundance ratios in planet-hosts. We aim to investigate the potential links between stellar chemistry and the presence of planets using high-resolution spectra of 149 F, G, and K dwarf and giant stars hosting planets or planetary systems. The spectra were obtained with the Vilnius University Echelle Spectrograph on the 1.65 m Mol\.{e}tai Observatory telescope. Stellar parameters were determined through standard analysis using equivalent widths and one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium. The differential synthetic spectrum method was used to uniformly determine carbon C(C2), nitrogen N(CN), oxygen [O I], magnesium Mg I, and silicon Si I elemental abundances as well as the C/O, N/O, and Mg/Si ratios. We found that [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] are lower in metal-rich dwarf hosts; whereas [N/Fe] is close to the Solar ratio. Giants show smaller scatter in [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] and lower than the Solar average [C/Fe] and C/O ratios. The (C+N+O) abundances increase with [Fe/H] in giant stars, with a minimal scatter. We also noted an overabundance of Mg and Si in planet hosting stars, particularly at lower metallicities, and a lower Mg/Si ratio in stars with planets. In giants hosting high-mass planets, nitrogen shows a moderate positive relationship with planet mass. C/O and N/O ratios show moderate negative and positive slopes in giant stars, respectively. The Mg/Si ratio shows a negative correlation with planet mass across the entire stellar sample.</description>

      <title>How to infer ocean freezing rates on icy satellites from measurements of ice thickness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-water oceans likely underlie the ice shells of Europa and Enceladus, but ocean properties are challenging to measure due to the overlying ice. Here, we consider gravity-driven flow of the ice shells of icy satellites and relate this to ocean freeze and melt rates. We employ a first-principles approach applicable to conductive ice shells in a Cartesian geometry. We derive a scaling law under which ocean freeze/melt rates can be estimated from shell-thickness measurements. Under a steady-state assumption, ocean freeze/melt rates can be inferred from measurements of ice thickness, given a basal viscosity. Depending on a characteristic thickness scale and basal viscosity, characteristic freeze/melt rates range from around O(10$^{-1}$) to O(10$^{-5}$) mm/year. Our scaling is validated with ice-penetrating radar measurements of ice thickness and modelled snow accumulation for Roosevelt Island, Antarctica. Our model, coupled with observations of shell thickness, could help estimate the magnitudes of ocean freeze/melt rates on icy satellites.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a code for Time-Reversible Astrophysical Close Encounters</title>

Abstract: We present TRACE, an almost time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed time-step symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez &amp; Dehnen. In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases, TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases, TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 12x speed-up. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 15x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 41x speed-up. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>How Meteor Showers Can Guide the Search for Long Period Comets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With orbital periods longer than 200 years, most long-period comets (LPCs) remain undiscovered until they are in-bound towards perihelion. The comets that pass close to Earth's orbit are Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs). Those with orbital periods up to ~4000 years tend to have passed close to Earth's orbit in a previous orbit and produced a meteoroid stream dense enough to be detected at Earth as a meteor shower. In anticipation of Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we investigate how these meteor showers can guide dedicated searches for their parent comets. Assuming search parameters informed by LSST, we calculated where the 17 known parent bodies of long-period comet meteor showers would have been discovered based on a cloud of synthetic comets generated from the shower properties as measured at Earth. We find that the synthetic comets predict the on-sky location of the parent comets at the time of their discovery. The parent comet's location on average would have been 1.51 $\pm$1.19$\deg$ from a line fit through the synthetic comet cloud. The difference between the heliocentric distance of the parent and mean heliocentric distance of synthetic comets on the line was 2.09 $\pm$1.89 au for comets with unknown absolute nuclear magnitudes and 0.96 $\pm$0.80 au for comets with known absolute nuclear magnitudes. We applied this method to the $\sigma$-Hydrids, the proposed meteor shower of Comet Nishimura, and found that it successfully matched the pre-covery location of this comet 8 months prior to Nishimura's discovery.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LX. Molecular line list for the ammonia isotopologue $^{15}$NH$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical line list for $^{15}$NH$_3$ CoYuTe-15 is presented based on the empirical potential energy and ab initio dipole moments surfaces developed and used for the production of the ExoMol line list CoYuTe for $^{14}$NH$_3$. The ro-vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions are computed using the variational program TROVE. The line list ranges up to 10000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda \geq 1$ $\mu$m) and contains 929 795 249 transitions between 1 269 961 states with $J\le 30$. The line list should be applicable for temperatures up to $\sim$1000 K. To improve the accuracy of the line positions, a set of experimentally-derived energy levels of $^{15}$NH$_3$ is produced using the MARVEL procedure. To this end, 37 experimental sources of the line positions of $^{15}$NH$_3$ available in the literature are collected, combined and systematised to produce a self-consistent spectroscopic network of 21095 $^{15}$NH$_3$ transitions covering 40 vibrational bands ranging up to 6818 cm$^{-1}$ and resulting in 2777 energy term values. These MARVEL energies are then used to replace the theoretical values in the CoYuTe-15 line list and also complemented by pseudo-MARVEL energies obtained by an isotopologue extrapolation using the previously reported MARVEL energies of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ parent isotopologue of ammonia. A list of 53856 high resolution transitions between MARVEL states and theoretical intensities is provided in the HITRAN format. Comparison with the recent experimental spectra of $^{15}$NH$_3$ illustrate the potential of the line list for detections and as an efficient assistant in spectroscopic assignments. The line list is available from www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>
