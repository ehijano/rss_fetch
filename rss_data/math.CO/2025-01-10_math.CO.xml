      <title>Critical $(P_5,W_4)$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G) = k$ but $\chi(G-v)&lt;k$ for all $v \in V(G)$. A graph is $(H_1,H_2)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H_1$ nor $H_2$. A $W_4$ is the graph consisting of a $C_4$ plus an additional vertex adjacent to all the vertices of the $C_4$.
  We show that there are finitely many $k$-vertex-critical $(P_5,W_4)$-free graphs for all $k \ge 1$ and we characterize all $5$-vertex-critical $(P_5,W_4)$-free graphs. Our results imply the existence of a polynomial-time certifying algorithm to decide the $k$-colorability of $(P_5,W_4)$-free graphs for each $k \ge 1$ where the certificate is either a $k$-coloring or a $(k+1)$-vertex-critical induced subgraph.</description>

      <title>Injective edge-coloring of graphs with small maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An injective $k$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a mapping $\phi$: $E(G)\longrightarrow\{1,2,...,k\}$, such that $\phi(e)\ne\phi(f)$ for any two edges $e$ and $f$ with $N_G(e)\cap N_G(f)\neq \emptyset$, where $N_G(e)$ is the set of edges adjacent to $e$. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an injective $k$-edge-coloring is called the injective chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_i'(G)$. In this paper, we prove that $\chi_i'(G)\le 7$ for every graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)\leq 4$ and mad$(G)&lt;\frac{8}{3}$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

      <title>On the crossing profile of rectilinear drawings of $K_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \textit{crossing profile} of a drawing of a graph. This is a sequence of integers whose $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ entry counts the number of edges in the drawing which are involved in exactly $k$ crossings. The first and second entries of this sequence (which count uncrossed edges and edges with one crossing, respectively) have been studied by multiple authors. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the entire sequence. Most of our results concern crossing profiles of rectilinear drawings of the complete graph $K_n$. We show that for any $k\leq (n-2)^2/4$ there is such a drawing for which the $k^{\text{th}}$ entry of the crossing profile is of magnitude $\Omega(n)$. On the other hand, we prove that for any $k \geq 1$ and any sufficiently large $n$, the $k^{\text{th}}$ entry can also be made to be $0$. As our main result, we essentially characterize the asymptotic behavior of both the maximum and minimum values that the sum of the first $k$ entries of the crossing profile might achieve. Our proofs are elementary and rely mostly on geometric constructions and classical results from discrete geometry and geometric graph theory.</description>

      <title>An A{\alpha}-spectral radius for the existence of {P3, P4, P5}-factors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with $n\geq25$. A $\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}$-factor is a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that every component of $H$ is isomorphic to an element of $\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}$. Nikiforov introduced the $A_{\alpha}$-matrix of $G$ as $A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G)$ [V. Nikiforov, Merging the $A$- and $Q$-spectral theories, Appl. Anal. Discrete Math. 11 (2017) 81--107], where $\alpha\in[0,1]$, $D(G)$ denotes the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees of $G$ and $A(G)$ denotes the adjacency matrix of $G$. The largest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}(G)$, denoted by $\lambda_{\alpha}(G)$, is called the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, it is proved that $G$ has a $\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}$-factor unless $G=K_1\vee(K_{n-2}\cup K_1)$ if $\lambda_{\alpha}(G)\geq\lambda_{\alpha}(K_1\vee(K_{n-2}\cup K_1))$, where $\alpha$ be a real number with $0\leq\alpha&lt;\frac{2}{3}$.</description>

      <title>D-Antimagic Labelings on Oriented Linear Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overrightarrow{G}$ be an oriented graph with the vertex set $V(\overrightarrow{G})$ and the arc set $A(\overrightarrow{G})$. Suppose that $D\subseteq \{0,1,\dots,\partial \}$ is a distance set where $\partial=\max \{d(u,v)&lt;\infty|u,v\in V(\overrightarrow{G})\}$. Given a bijection $h:V(\overrightarrow{G}) \rightarrow\{1,2,\dots,|V(\overrightarrow{G})|\}$, the $D$-weight of a vertex $v\in V(\overrightarrow{G})$ is defined as $\omega_D(v)=\sum_{u\in N_D(v)}h(u)$, where $N_D(v)=\{u\in V|d(v,u)\in D\}$. A bijection $h$ is called a $D$-antimagic labeling if for every pair of distinct vertices $x$ and $y$, $\omega_D(x)\ne \omega_D(y)$. An oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$ is called $D$-antimagic if it admits such a labeling.
  In addition to introducing the notion of $D$-antimagic labeling for oriented graphs, we investigate some properties of $D$-antimagic oriented graphs. In particular, we study $D$-antimagic linear forests for some $D$. We characterize $D$-antimagic paths where $1 \in D$, $n-1\in D$, or $\{0,n-2\}\subset D$. We characterize distance antimagic trees and forests. We conclude by constructing $D$-antimagic labelings on oriented linear forests.</description>

      <title>On the Boxicity of Line Graphs and of Their Complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boxicity of a graph is the smallest dimension $d$ allowing a representation of it as the intersection graph of a set of $d$-dimensional axis-parallel boxes. We present a simple general approach to determining the boxicity of a graph based on studying its ``interval-order subgraphs.''
  The power of the method is first tested on the boxicity of some popular graphs that have resisted previous attempts: the boxicity of the Petersen graph is $3$, and more generally, that of the Kneser-graphs $K(n,2)$ is $n-2$ if $n\ge 5$, confirming a conjecture of Caoduro and Lichev [Discrete Mathematics, Vol. 346, 5, 2023].
  As every line graph is an induced subgraph of the complement of $K(n,2)$, the developed tools show furthermore that line graphs have only a polynomial number of edge-maximal interval-order subgraphs. This opens the way to polynomial-time algorithms for problems that are in general $NP$-hard: for the existence and optimization of interval-order subgraphs of line graphs, or of interval completions and the boxicity of their complement, if the boxicity is bounded.
  We finally extend our approach to upper and lower bounding the boxicity of line graphs.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of labeled graphs and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $1973$, Harary and Palmer posed the problem of enumeration of labeled graphs on $n \geq 1$ unisolated vertices and $l \geq 0$ edges. In $1997$, Bender et al.\ obtained a recurrence relation representing the sequence $A054548$(OEIS) of labeled graphs on $n \geq 0$ unisolated vertices containing $q \geq \frac{n}{2}$ edges. In $2020$, Bhavale and Waphare obtained a recurrence relation representing the sequence of fundamental basic blocks on $n \geq 0$ comparable reducible elements, having nullity $l \geq \lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor$. In this paper, we prove the equivalence of these two sequences. We also provide an edge labeling for a given vertex labeled finite simple graph.</description>

      <title>D-Antimagic Labelings of Oriented 2-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$ and $D$ a distance set of $\overrightarrow{G}$, $\overrightarrow{G}$ is $D$-antimagic if there exists a bijective vertex labeling such that the sum of all labels of the $D$-out-neighbors of each vertex is distinct.
  This paper investigates $D$-antimagic labelings of 2-regular oriented graphs. We characterize $D$-antimagic oriented cycles, when $|D|=1$; $D$-antimagic unidirectional odd cycles, when $|D|=2$; and $D$-antimagic $\Theta$-oriented cycles. Finally, we characterize $D$-antimagic oriented 2-regular graphs, when $|D|=1$, and $D$-antimagic $\Theta$-oriented 2-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On Maximum Induced Forests of the Balanced Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are examining a specific type of graph called a balanced bipartite graph. The balanced bipartite graph, such as $\mathcal{B}$, has two parts, $V_1$ and $V_2$, each containing $n$ vertices, for a total of $2n$ vertices. The degree of a vertex $v$ in $V_1\cup\,V_2$ is denoted by $d_\mathcal{B}(v)$. The minimum degree of any vertex in the graph $\mathcal{B}$ is represented by $\delta(\mathcal{B})$. If $S$ is a subset of $V_1\cup\,V_2$, then the subgraph of $\mathcal{B}$ induced by $S$ is the graph that has $S$ as its vertex set and contains all the edges of $\mathcal{B}$ that have both endpoints in $S$. This subgraph is denoted by $\mathcal{B}[S]$. The forest number of a graph $\mathcal{B}$ is the size of the largest subset of vertices of $\mathcal{B}$ that form an induced forest. We use $f(\mathcal{B})$ to represent the forest number of graph $\mathcal{B}$. A decycling set or a feedback vertex set of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal results in a forest. The smallest possible size of a decycling set of $\mathcal{B}$ is represented by $\nabla(\mathcal{B})$. Finding the decycling number of $\mathcal{B}$ is equivalent to determining the largest order of an induced forest, i.e., $f(\mathcal{B})+\nabla(\mathcal{B})=2n$. In this essay, we study the structure and cardinality of the largest subsets of vertices of graph $\mathcal{B}$ that form induced forests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a distance set $D$, an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}$ is $D$-antimagic if there exists a bijective vertex labeling such that the sum of all labels of $D$-out-neighbors is distinct for each vertex. This paper provides all orientations and all possible $D$s of a $D$-antimagic oriented star. We provide necessary and sufficient condition for $D$-antimagic oriented star forest containing isomorphic oriented stars. We show that for all possible $D$s, there exists an orientation for a star forest to admit a $D$-antimagic labeling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the rational power series $h(x) = \sum_{i \geq 0} h_i x^i \in \mathbb{C}[[x]]$, the Hankel determinant of order $n$ is defined as $H_n(h(x)) := \det (h_{i+j})_{0 \leq i,j \leq n-1}$. We explore the relationship between the Hankel continued fraction and the generalized Sturm sequence. This connection inspires the development of a novel algorithm for computing the Hankel determinants $\{H_i(h(x))\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ using $O(n \log^2 n)$ arithmetic operations. We also explore the connection between the generalized Sturm sequences and the signature of Hankel matrices.</description>

      <title>Independence, induced subgraphs, and domination in $K_{1,r}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $\mathcal{F}$ a family of graphs. Define $\alpha_{\mathcal{F}}(G)$ as the maximum order of any induced subgraph of $G$ that belongs to the family $\mathcal{F}$. For the family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs with \emph{chromatic number} at most~$k$, we prove that if $G$ is $K_{1,r}$-free, then $\alpha_{\mathcal{F}}(G) \le (r-1)k\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the \emph{domination number}. When $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of empty graphs, this bound simplifies to $\alpha(G) \le 2\gamma(G)$ for $K_{1,3}$-free (claw-free) graphs, where $\alpha(G)$ is the \emph{independence number} of $G$. For $d$-regular graphs, this is further refined to the bound $\alpha(G) \le 2\left(\frac{d+1}{d+2}\right)\gamma(G)$, which is tight for $d \in \{2, 3, 4\}$. Using Ramsey theory, we extend this framework to edge-hereditary graph families, showing that for $K_{1,r}$-free graphs, we have $\alpha_{\mathcal{F}}(G) \le r(K_r, \mathcal{F^*})\gamma(G)$, where $\mathcal{F^*}$ is the set of graphs not in $\mathcal{F}$. Specializing to $K_q$-free graphs, we show $\alpha_{\mathcal{F}}(G) \le (r(K_q, K_r) - 1)\gamma(G)$. Finally, for the \emph{$k$-independence number} $\alpha_k(G)$, we prove that if $G$ is $K_{1,r}$-free with order $n$ and minimum degree $\delta \ge k+1$, \[ \alpha_k(G) \le \left( \frac{(r-1)(k+1)}{\delta - k + (r-1)(k+1)} \right) n, \] and this bound is sharp for all parameters.</description>

      <title>Computational Graph Decompositions I: Oriented Berge-Fulkerson Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berge-Fulkerson conjecture states that every bridgeless cubic graph can be covered with six perfect matchings such that each edge is covered exactly twice. An equivalent reformulation is that it's possible to find a 6-cycle 4-cover. In this paper we discuss the oriented version (o6c4c) of the latter statement, pose it as a conjecture and prove it for the family of Isaacs flower snarks. Similarly to the case of oriented cycle double cover, we can always construct an orientable surface (possibly with boundary) from an o6c4c solution. If the o6c4c solution itself splits into two (not necessarily oriented) cycle double covers, then it's also possible to build another pair of orientable surfaces (also possibly with boundaries). Finally we show how to build a ribbon graph, and for some special o6c4c cases we show that this ribbon graph corresponds to an oriented 6-cycle double cover.</description>

      <title>A Path Variant of the Explorer Director Game on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Explorer Director game, first introduced by Nedev and Muthukrishnan (2008), simulates a Mobile Agent exploring a ring network with an inconsistent global sense of direction. The two players, the Explorer and the Director, jointly control the movement of a token on the graph. During each turn, the Explorer calls any valid distance, $d$, with the aim of maximizing the number of vertices the token visits, and the Director moves the token to any vertex distance $d$ away with the aim of minimizing the number of visited vertices. The game, on graph $G$ with starting vertex $v$, ends when no new vertices could be visited assuming both players are playing optimally, and we denote the total number of visited vertices by $f_d(G,v)$. Since 2008, many authors have explored $f_d(G,v)$ for various graph families as well as analyses of complexity.
  In this work, we study a variation of this game focused on path lengths rather than distances. In this variant, if the token is on vertex $u$, the Explorer is now allowed to select any valid \emph{path length}, $l$, and the Director can now move the token to any vertex $v$ such that $G$ contains a $uv$ path of length $l$. The corresponding parameter is denoted by $f_p(G,v)$. In this paper, we explore how far apart $f_d(G,v)$ and $f_p(G,v)$ can be for various graph families, proving that for any $n$ there are graphs $G$ and $H$ with $f_p(G,v)-f_d(G,v)&gt;n$ and $f_d(G,v)-f_p(G,v)&gt;n$.</description>

      <title>Almost every Latin square has a decomposition into transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1782, Euler conjectured that no Latin square of order $n\equiv 2\; \textrm{mod}\; 4$ has a decomposition into transversals. While confirmed for $n=6$ by Tarry in 1900, Bose, Parker, and Shrikhande constructed counterexamples in 1960 for each $n\equiv 2\; \textrm{mod}\; 4$ with $n\geq 10$. We show that, in fact, counterexamples are extremely common, by showing that if a Latin square of order $n$ is chosen uniformly at random then with high probability it has a decomposition into transversals.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects up to half the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Delsarte Dual LPs: Lifting, Constructions and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central and longstanding open problem in coding theory is the rate-versus-distance trade-off for binary error-correcting codes. In a seminal work, Delsarte introduced a family of linear programs establishing relaxations on the size of optimum codes. To date, the state-of-the-art upper bounds for binary codes come from dual feasible solutions to these LPs. Still, these bounds are exponentially far from the best-known existential constructions.
  Recently, hierarchies of linear programs extending and strengthening Delsarte's original LPs were introduced for linear codes, which we refer to as higher-order Delsarte LPs. These new hierarchies were shown to provably converge to the actual value of optimum codes, namely, they are complete hierarchies. Therefore, understanding them and their dual formulations becomes a valuable line of investigation. Nonetheless, their higher-order structure poses challenges. In fact, analysis of all known convex programming hierarchies strengthening Delsarte's original LPs has turned out to be exceedingly difficult and essentially nothing is known, stalling progress in the area since the 1970s.
  Our main result is an analysis of the higher-order Delsarte LPs via their dual formulation. Although quantitatively, our current analysis only matches the best-known upper bounds, it shows, for the first time, how to tame the complexity of analyzing a hierarchy strengthening Delsarte's original LPs. In doing so, we reach a better understanding of the structure of the hierarchy, which may serve as the foundation for further quantitative improvements. We provide two additional structural results for this hierarchy. First, we show how to \emph{explicitly} lift any feasible dual solution from level $k$ to a (suitable) larger level $\ell$ while retaining the objective value. Second, we give a novel proof of completeness using the dual formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the viewpoint of $\tau$-tilting theory, we study Frobenius--Perron dimensions of finite-dimensional algebras. First, we evaluate the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of $\tau$-tilting finite algebras by a combinatorial method in $\tau$-tilting theory. Secondly, we give the upper bound of the Frobenius--Perron dimension for a $\tau$-tilting finite algebra of tame representation type. Thirdly, we determine the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of Nakayama algebras and generalized preprojective algebras of Dynkin type in the sense of Geiss--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f}$ of homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $n\over d$ is a root of $b_{f}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong monodromy conjecture for arrangements. U. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. We also give some essential indecomposable homogeneous polynomials $f$ such that $-{n\over d}$ is not a root of $b_{f}$. This leads to a conjectural sufficient condition for $b_{f}(-{n\over d})=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the space, $R_m$, of $m$-symmetric functions consisting of polynomials that are symmetric in the variables $x_{m+1},x_{m+2},x_{m+3},\dots$ but have no special symmetry in the variables $x_1,\dots,x_m$. We obtain $m$-symmetric Macdonald polynomials by $t$-symmetrizing non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, and show that they form a basis of $R_m$. We define $m$-symmetric Schur functions through a somewhat complicated process involving their dual basis, tableaux combinatorics, and the Hecke algebra generators, and then prove some of their most elementary properties. We conjecture that the $m$-symmetric Macdonald polynomials (suitably normalized and plethystically modified) expand positively in terms of $m$-symmetric Schur functions. We obtain relations on the $(q,t)$-Koska coefficients $K_{\Omega \Lambda}(q,t)$ in the $m$-symmetric world, and show in particular that the usual $(q,t)$-Koska coefficients are special cases of the $K_{\Omega \Lambda}(q,t)$'s. Finally, we show that when $m$ is large, the positivity conjecture, modulo a certain subspace, becomes a positivity conjecture on the expansion of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials in terms of non-symmetric Hall-Littlewood polynomials.</description>

      <title>Berge's conjecture for cubic graphs with small colouring defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture of Berge suggests that every bridgeless cubic graph can be expressed as a union of at most five perfect matchings. This conjecture trivially holds for $3$-edge-colourable cubic graphs, but remains widely open for graphs that are not $3$-edge-colourable. The aim of this paper is to verify the validity of Berge's conjecture for cubic graphs that are in a certain sense close to $3$-edge-colourable graphs. We measure the closeness by looking at the colouring defect, which is defined as the minimum number of edges left uncovered by any collection of three perfect matchings. While $3$-edge-colourable graphs have defect $0$, every bridgeless cubic graph with no $3$-edge-colouring has defect at least $3$. In 2015, Steffen proved that the Berge conjecture holds for cyclically $4$-edge-connected cubic graphs with colouring defect $3$ or $4$. Our aim is to improve Steffen's result in two ways. We show that all bridgeless cubic graphs with defect $3$ satisfy Berge's conjecture irrespectively of their cyclic connectivity. If, additionally, the graph in question is cyclically $4$-edge-connected, then four perfect matchings suffice, unless the graph is the Petersen graph. The result is best possible as there exists an infinite family of cubic graphs with cyclic connectivity $3$ which have defect $3$ but cannot be covered with four perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>A decomposition theorem for balanced measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected graph. A probability measure $\mu$ on $V$ is called "balanced" if it has the following property: if $T_\mu(v)$ denotes the "earth mover's" cost of transporting all the mass of $\mu$ from all over the graph to the vertex $v$, then $T_\mu$ attains its global maximum at each point in the support of $\mu$. We prove a decomposition result that characterizes balanced measures as convex combinations of suitable "extremal" balanced measures that we call "basic." An upper bound on the number of basic balanced measures on $G$ follows, and an example shows that this estimate is essentially sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the vertices of the $k$-dominating graph, denoted $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$, correspond to the dominating sets of $G$ with cardinality at most $k$. Two vertices of $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding dominating sets in $G$ can be obtained from one other by adding or removing a single vertex of $G$. Since $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is not necessarily connected when $k &lt; |V(G)|$, much research has focused on conditions under which $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is connected and recent work has explored the existence of Hamilton paths in the $k$-dominating graph. We consider the complementary problem of determining the conditions under which the $k$-dominating graph is Eulerian. In the case where $k = |V(G)|$, we characterize those graphs $G$ for which $\mathcal{D}_k(G)$ is Eulerian. In the case where $k$ is restricted, we determine for a number of graph classes, the conditions under which the $k$-dominating graph is Eulerian.</description>

Abstract: A (finite, undirected) graph is $(n,k)$-colourable if we can assign each vertex a $k$-subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoint subsets. We consider the following problem: if a graph is $(n,k)$-colourable, then for what pairs $(n',k')$ is it also $(n',k')$-colourable? This question can be translated into a question regarding multi-colourings of Kneser graphs, for which Stahl formulated a conjecture in 1976. We present new results, strengthen existing results, and in particular present much simpler proofs of several known cases of the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the join of two graphs be the union of two disjoint graphs connected by $j$ edges in a one-to-one manner. In previous work by Gyurov and Pinzon, which generalized the results of Badura and Rara, the determinant of the adjacency matrix of two $j$-joined graphs was decomposed to sums of determinants of these graphs with vertex deletions or directed graph handles. In this paper, we find the necessary and sufficient properties of a graph $G$ so that for any graph $H$, the determinant of $G$ joined with $H$ and $H$ joined with $G$ is equal to the determinant of $H$. Subsequently, we define a homomorphism from a quotient of graphs with the $j$-join operation to the monoid of integer matrices under multiplication. We demonstrate through examples that this homomorphism allows us to more easily calculate determinants of chains of joined graphs. This generalizes the work done on determinants of grids and cylinders done in various other works.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present five different formulas for both discrete and fractional iterations of an invertible power series $f$ utilizing a novel and unifying approach from umbral calculus. Established formulas are extended, and their proofs simplified, while new formulas are introduced. In particular, through the use of $q$-calculus identities, we eliminate the requirement for $f'(0)$ to equal $1$ and, consequently, the corresponding new expressions for the iterative logarithm are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article discusses a combinatorial extension of tropical intersection theory to spaces given by glueing quotients of partially open convex polyhedral cones by finitely many automorphisms. This extension is done in terms of linear poic-complexes and poic-fibrations, mainly motivated by the case of the moduli spaces of tropical curves of arbitrary genus and marking. We define tropical cycles of a linear poic-complex and of a poic-fibration, and discuss the pushforward maps in these situations. In the context of moduli spaces of tropical curves, we also discuss "clutching morphisms" and "forgetting the marking" morphisms. In a subsequent article we apply this framework to moduli spaces of discrete admissible covers and study the loci of tropical curves that appear as the source of a degree-$d$ discrete admissible cover of a genus-$h$ $m$-marked tropical curve, for fixed $d$, $h$ and $m$.</description>

      <title>A Coprime Buratti-Horak-Rosa Conjecture and Grid-Based Linear Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a "Coprime Buratti-Horak-Rosa (BHR) Conjecture": If $L$ is a multiset of size $v-1$ with support contained in $\{1, 2, \ldots, \lfloor v/2 \rfloor\}$ such that $\gcd(v,x) = 1$ for all $x \in L$, then $L$ is realizable. This is a specialization of the well-known BHR Conjecture and it includes Buratti's original conjecture.
  We argue that the most effective route to a resolution of the conjecture when the support has size 3 is to focus on $L = \{1^a, x^b, y^c\}$, where $1&lt;x&lt;y$, with $a$ large subject to $a &lt; x+y$. We use grid-based graphs to construct linear realizations for many such multisets. A partial list of parameter sets that the constructions cover: $a = x+y-1$; $a = x+y-2$ when $x=3$ or $x$ is even; $a \geq 4x-3$ for $x$ odd, $y &gt; 2x-2$, and $b \geq y-2x+2$; $a \geq x$ for $y=tx$, with $x$ and $t$ odd, and $b \geq tx+2t-3$; $a \geq 7$ for $x=3$ and $b \geq y-4$. As well as these (and further) immediate results, the techniques introduced show promise for further development, both to head towards a proof of the conjecture when the support has size 3 and for situations with larger support.
  We also show that if $y &gt; (2x^2 + 2x + 1)/(x-2)$ then the Coprime BHR Conjecture holds for $\{1^a,x^b,y^c\}$ for infinitely many values of $v$, and that there are at most 3 values of $v$ for which it does not hold when $(x,y) = (6,18)$.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Finding Degree-Doubling Nodes in Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism in Union-Closed Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}_1$ and $\mathcal{K}_2$ be $\textit{pure union-closed families of sets}$. A map $h: \mathcal{K}_1 \to \mathcal{K}_2$ is an isomorphism if it is bijective and preserves unions: $h(A \cup B) = h(A) \cup h(B)$ for all $A, B \in \mathcal{K}_1$. We establish that for any isomorphism $h$, there exists a corresponding $\textit{hyperisomorphism}$ $H: \bigcup \mathcal{K}_1 \to \bigcup \mathcal{K}_2$ such that $h(A) = H(A)$ for all $A \in \mathcal{K}_1$. This result provides a new framework for studying the structural properties of union-closed families and may offer insights into the union-closed set conjecture.</description>

      <title>Optimal List Recoloring of Subcubic Graphs and Complete Multipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a list-assignment $L$, the reconfiguration graph $C_L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are proper $L$-colorings of $G$ and whose edges link two colorings that differ on only one vertex. If $|L(v)| \ge d(v) + 2$ for every vertex of $G$, it is known that $C_L(G)$ is connected. In this case, Cambie et al. investigated the diameter of $C_L(G)$. They conjectured that $diam(C_L(G)) \le n(G) + \mu(G)$ with $\mu(G)$ the size of a maximum matching of $G$ and proved several results towards this conjecture. We answer to two of their open problems by proving the conjecture for two classes of graphs, namely subcubic graphs and complete multipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Do perfect powers repel partition numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2013 Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that $p(n)$ is never a power of an integer when $n&gt;1.$ We confirm this claim in many cases. We also observe that integral powers appear to repel the partition numbers. If $k&gt;1$ and $\Delta_k(n)$ is the distance between $p(n)$ and the nearest $k$th power, then for every $d\geq 0$ we conjecture that there are at most finitely many $n$ for which $\Delta_k(n)\leq d.$ More precisely, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0,$ we conjecture that $$M_k(d):=\max\{n \ : \ \Delta_k(n)\leq d\}=o( d^{\varepsilon}).$$ In $k$-power aspect with $d$ fixed, we also conjecture that if $k$ is sufficiently large, then $$ M_k(d)=\max \left\{ n \ : \ p(n)-1\leq d\right\}. $$ In other words, $1$ generally appears to be the closest $k$th power among the partition numbers.</description>

      <title>The Integrated Vehicle and Pollster Routing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.07356v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The National Statistics Bureau of Ecuador carries out monthly polls to monitor the evolution of the Consumer Price Index, a metric measuring consumer prices of essential commodities. These surveys are administered across a designated set of stores, with a fleet of vehicles transporting pollsters from the bureau headquarters to the chosen locations. Moreover, pollsters move between stores using pedestrian paths or using a vehicle to shorten the travel time. This paper introduces the Integrated Vehicle and Pollster Routing Problem and presents an integer programming model to effectively schedule pollster visits to selected stores while optimizing the routing of the vehicle fleet. Results on the computational complexity, a three-phase algorithm, and computational experience based on real-world instances are provided.</description>

      <title>Extending Wormald's Differential Equation Method to One-sided Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we formulate a "one-sided" version of Wormald's differential equation method. In the standard "two-sided" method, one is given a family of random variables which evolve over time and which satisfy some conditions including a tight estimate of the expected change in each variable over one time step. These estimates for the expected one-step changes suggest that the variables ought to be close to the solution of a certain system of differential equations, and the standard method concludes that this is indeed the case. We give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each variable's expected one-step change, we have only an upper bound. Our proof is very simple, and is flexible enough that if we instead assume tight estimates on the variables, then we recover the conclusion of the standard differential equation method.</description>

      <title>Paired-domination Problem on Circle and $k$-polygon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ is considered a dominating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V - D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. We called a dominating set $D$ as a paired-dominating set if the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we show that determining the minimum paired-dominating set on circle graphs is NP-complete. We further propose an $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-2k})$-time algorithm for $k$-polygon graphs, a subclass of circle graphs, for finding the minimum paired-dominating set. Moreover, we extend our method to improve the algorithm for finding the minimum dominating set on $k$-polygon graphs in~[\emph{E.S.~Elmallah and L.K.~Stewart, Independence and domination in polygon graphs, Discrete Appl. Math., 1993}] and reduce their time-complexity from $O(n^{4k^2+3})$ to $O(n^{3k-5})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ for $d$-regular graphs. It is well-known that $p_c \geq \frac{1}{d-1}$ for such graphs, with equality holding for the $d$-regular tree. We prove that among all quasi-transitive $d$-regular graphs, the equality $p_c(G) = \frac{1}{d-1}$ holds if and only if $G$ is a tree. Furthermore, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the necessity of the quasi-transitive assumption.</description>

Abstract: We prove that meromorphic differentials $\omega^{(0)}_n(z_1,...,z_n)$ which are recursively generated by an involution identity are symmetric in all their arguments $z_1,...,z_n$. The proof involves an intriguing combinatorial identity between integer partitions into given number of parts.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>
