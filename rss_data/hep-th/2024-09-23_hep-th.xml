      <title>Study of Information Restoring Effects in Virasoro Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the large central charge $c$ limit, the Virasoro blocks in CFT$_2$ suffer from information loss when studying the BTZ black holes in the dual AdS$_3$ theory. Recent studies have proved that non-perturbative $e^{-c}$ corrections resolves information loss. Here, we study universal features of the spectrum of heavy states from general properties of finite $c$ Virasoro conformal blocks. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of correlators beyond "Page" time $ t \sim S_{BH}$, entropy of the black hole. In the Lorentzian regime, we wish to better understand the transition from an exponential decay behaviour of Virasoro blocks in the heavy-light limit to a power-law decay at late times.</description>

      <title>On Supergravity and Noncritical Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the long-term goal of finding holographic descriptions for ${\mathcal N}=1$ and ${\mathcal N}=2$ super QCD, we revisit the subject of ''noncritical'' superstring theory. Focusing on string models with 6d super Poincar\'e invariance, we provide a careful worldsheet derivation of the leading-order effective theories for the lowest modes. We identify them as $\textit{seven}$-dimensional, $\textit{maximally supersymmetric}$ gauged supergravities: the $SO(4)$ theory for noncritical IIA and the $ISO(4)$ theory for noncritical IIB. The same theories also arise as consistent truncations on $S^3$ of the 10d IIB and IIA supergravities, respectively, where the chirality flip is as expected from T-duality. These effective supergravities should be interpreted in the following sense. The noncritical string can be viewed as a special case of a discrete series of backgrounds labelled by an integer $k$ (which counts the number of NS5 branes in a certain duality frame); the ''noncritical'' value is $k=2$, while for $k \to \infty$ one recovers a weakly-curved 10d target space. The effective supergravities described here give an accurate description of the interactions among the lowest modes for $k \to \infty$, with higher derivative corrections suppressed by powers of $1/k$. We discuss BPS solutions of the 7d gauged supergravities and their uplift to 10d solutions. In particular, we find a novel class of solutions with RR flux, parametrized by a function of three variables that solves an elegant PDE. While we cannot solve the PDE in closed form except in trivial cases, we confirm that our solutions correspond to a 10d IIA Hanany-Witten setup with continuous distributions of both ''color'' D4 branes and ''flavor'' D6 branes.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a mesoscopic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a probabilistic mesoscopic description to draw conceptual and quantitative analogies between Brownian motion and late-time fluctuations of thermal correlation functions in generic chaotic systems respecting ETH. In this framework, thermal correlation functions of `simple' operators are described by stochastic processes, which are able to probe features of the microscopic theory only in a probabilistic sense. We apply this formalism to the case of semiclassical gravity in AdS$_3$, showing that wormhole contributions can be naturally identified as moments of stochastic processes. We also point out a `Matryoshka doll' recursive structure in which information is hidden in higher and higher moments, and which can be naturally justified within the stochastic framework. We then re-interpret the gravitational results from the boundary perspective, promoting the OPE data of the CFT to probability distributions. The outcome of this study shows that semiclassical gravity in AdS can be naturally interpreted as a mesoscopic description of quantum gravity, and a mesoscopic holographic duality can be framed as a moment-vs-probability-distribution duality.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the 1-loop, 2-vertex correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized volume-complexity for Lovelock black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, We explore the time dependence of the generalized complexity of Lovelock black holes via the "complexity = anything" conjecture, which expands upon the notion of "complexity = volume" and generates a large class of observables. By applying a specific condition, a more limited class can be chosen, whose time growth is equivalent to a conserved momentum. Specifically, we investigate the numerical full time behavior of complexity time rate, focusing on the second and third orders of Lovelock theory, incorporating an additional term -- the square of the Weyl tensor of the background spacetime -- into the generalization function. Furthermore, we study the case with three additional scalar terms: the square of Riemann and Ricci tensors, and the Ricci scalar for second-order gravity (GB) and show how it can affect to multiple asymptotic behavior of time. Additionally, we show how the phase transition of generalized complexity and its time evolution occur at $\tau_{turning}$ point where the maximal generalized volume supersedes another branch. Moreover, we show the proportionality complexity time rate at late times to the difference of temperature times entropy in two horizons ($TS(r_+)-TS(r_-)$) for charged black holes, which can be corrected by a function of each radius in generalized case.</description>

      <title>Finite complexity of the ER=EPR state in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ER=EPR conjecture states that quantum entanglement between boundary degrees of freedom leads to the emergence of bulk spacetime itself. Although this has been tested extensively in String Theory for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, its implications for an accelerating universe, such as our own, remain less explored. Assuming a cosmic version of ER=EPR for de Sitter space, we explore computational complexity corresponding to long-range entanglement responsible for bulk states on spacelike hypersurfaces. Rather remarkably, we find that the complexity (per unit volume) of the Euclidean vacuum, as an entangled state over two boundary CFT vacua, is finite both in the UV and the IR, which provides additional evidence for cosmic ER=EPR. Our result seems to be a universal feature of spacetimes with horizons and is explicitly independent of the details of the model under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel solution in the low energy limit of heterotic string theory describing accelerating charged and rotating black holes with NUT parameter. Some aspects of the new spacetime are discussed, such as locations of horizons, ergoregions, conic singularity, closed timelike curves, and area temperature product. We find some of the properties resemble the ones belong to accelerating Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime.</description>

      <title>No-boundary extremal surfaces in slow-roll inflation and other cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous work on de Sitter extremal surfaces anchored at the future boundary, we study no-boundary extremal surfaces in slow-roll inflation models, with perturbations to no-boundary global $dS$ preserving the spatial isometry. While in pure de Sitter space the Euclidean hemisphere gives a real area equalling half de Sitter entropy, the no-boundary extremal surface areas here have nontrivial real and imaginary pieces overall. We evaluate the area integrals in the complex time-plane defining appropriate contours. For the 4-dim case, the real and imaginary finite corrections at leading order in the slow-roll parameter match those in the semiclassical expansion of the Wavefunction (or action), and corroborate the cosmic brane interpretation discussed previously. We also study no-boundary extremal surfaces in other cosmologies including 3-dimensional inflation and Schwarzschild de Sitter spaces with small mass.</description>

      <title>The no boundary density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a no-boundary proposal for a subregion of the universe. In the classical approximation, this density matrix involves finding a specific classical solution of the equations of motion with no boundary. Beyond the usual no boundary condition at early times, we also have another no boundary condition in the region we trace out. We can find the prescription by starting from the usual Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wavefunction on a full slice and tracing out the unobserved region in the classical approximation. We discuss some specific subregions and compute the corresponding solutions. These geometries lead to phenomenologically unacceptable probabilities, as expected.
  We also discuss how the usual Coleman de Luccia bubble solutions can be interpreted as a possible no boundary contribution to the density matrix of the universe. These geometries lead to local (but not global) maxima of the probability that are phenomenologically acceptable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a modified black brane within AdS spacetime, characterized by the Lagrangian density $\frac{1}{q} \text{arcsin}(qR)-2\Lambda$. Due to the absence of an analytic solution, we approach the Einstein equations using a perturbative method, extending our analysis to the second order in $q$. Subsequently, we compute the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our results suggest that the KSS Bound is not saturated in this model.</description>

      <title>The local thermodynamic instability from negative susceptibility in a holographic superfluid with nonlinear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local thermodynamic stability from the charge susceptibility of a holographic superfluid model at finite superfluid velocity is studied in the probe limit. Previous studies show that beyond a finite value of the superfluid velocity, the superfluid phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble becomes first order. We further reveal that in the canonical ensemble, the superfluid phase transition is still second order, and the difference indicates a section with negative susceptibility which means local thermodynamic instability beyond this superfluid velocity. However, we also meet the ``cave of wind'' behavior at larger superfluid velocity which complicate the phase diagram. We further study the influence of the two nonlinear terms $\lambda|\psi|^4$ and $\tau|\psi|^6$ with parameters $\lambda$ and $\tau$ on the condensate curves, and set appropriate values of $\lambda$ and $\tau$ to remove the "cave of wind" region in the canonical ensemble to get a more elegant phase diagram and better represent the region with such instability, which is possible to be used to realize spontaneous formation of vortexes and quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Stability Analysis in $f(T)$ Braneworld Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed analysis of the full linear perturbations in the braneworld scenario within $f(T)$ gravity. By decomposing the perturbations of the theory into the scalar, transverse vector, antisymmetric pseudotensor, and symmetric transverse-traceless tensor modes, we derive the quadratic action for each mode. The results indicate that there is a total of one scalar, one massless vector, and one tensor propagating degrees of freedom. Consequently, in comparison to general relativity, no additional degrees of freedom appear under the flat braneworld background in the linearized theory. For a thick brane model with $f(T)=T+ \alpha T^2$, we find that it exhibits stability against linear perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in a special type of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity-scalar model, where both the dilaton and the scalar matter fields have noncanonical kinetic terms, it is possible to construct kink solutions whose linear perturbation equation is a Schr\"odinger-like equation with Rosen-Morse potential. For this potential, eigenvalues and wave functions of the bound states, if had any, can be derived by using the standard shape invariance procedure. Depending on the values of the parameters, the stability potential can be reflective or reflectionless. There can be an arbitrary number of shape modes, but the zero mode is always absent.</description>

      <title>Complex D($2,1;\zeta $) and spin chain solutions from Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using properties of OSp(4|2) and PSL(2|2), we investigate the super geometry of the parametric D($2,1;\zeta $) labeled by variable $\zeta $ belonging to $\mathbb{C}\backslash \{-1,0\}$ and we give applications in the study of integrable superspin chains. This $9|8$ dimensional Lie supergroup has three orthogonal isospins in its even part SL($2,\mathbb{C}$)$^{\otimes 3}$ assembled by the tri-fundamental $2^{\otimes 3}$ with odd parity. It undergoes contractions at $\zeta =-1,0$ where an SL($2,\mathbb{C}$) gets decompactified into commutative $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ interpreted in terms of three central extensions. By help of the obtained characteristic features of D($2,1;\zeta $) and their local structures at the special points $\zeta =\pm 1$, we calculate the Lax operator $\mathcal{L}_{\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\zeta )}^{(\mathfrak{\eta})}$ solving the RLL equation describing the integrability of the superspin chain $\mathfrak{d}$($2,1;\zeta $). We also complete missing results regarding the calculation of $\mathcal{L}_{psl(2|2)}^{(\mathfrak{\mu })}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{osp(4|2)}^{(\mathfrak{\mu})}$. Other features of the four super Dynkin diagrams $S\mathfrak{DD}_{\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\zeta )}^{(\mathfrak{\eta})}$ and weight graphs of $\mathfrak{d}$($2,1;\zeta $) as well as discrete automorphisms are also given.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Corrections to Near-Extremal Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on the quantum mechanics of near-extremal non-supersymmetric black holes has identified a characteristic $T^{3/2}$ scaling of the low temperature black hole partition function. This result has only been derived using the path integral in the near-horizon region and relies on many assumptions. We discuss how to derive the $T^{3/2}$ scaling for the near-extremal rotating BTZ black hole from a calculation in the full black hole background using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula, which expresses the 1-loop determinant of a thermal geometry in terms of a product over the quasinormal mode spectrum. We also derive the spectral measure for fields of any spin in Euclidean BTZ and use it to provide a new proof of the DHS formula and a new, direct derivation of the BTZ heat kernel. The computations suggest a path to proving the $T^{3/2}$ scaling for the asymptotically flat 4d Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Observables in Expanding Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observables in expanding universes are crucial to understand the physics of the early universe. In these lectures, we review some recent progress in understanding their mathematical structure and extract the physics encoded in them. After discussing the most salient features of an expanding background and their consequences for defining an observable, we focus on the so-called Bunch--Davies wavefunctional. We analyze its analytic properties on general grounds and introduce an integral representation for it in perturbation theory for a special class of scalar toy models. We discuss both the diagrammatics associated to the usual Feynman rules and combinatorial rules on the graphs, which generate a representation free of spurious poles. Such combinatorial rules find their origin in the combinatorics of the cosmological polytopes of which we provide a gentle introduction to its definition and its main features. Finally, the combinatorics of the cosmological polytopes turns out to determine the combinatorics of a special class of nestohedra that encode the asymptotic behaviour of the cosmological integrals. We provide a general description of such structures and behaviour, which is of crucial importance to understand the infrared divergences which plague observables in an expanding background. These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11--22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalizable theories and finite formulation of QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how the finite formulation of QFT based on Callan-Symanzik equations can be generalised to the case of non-renormalizable theories. We derive an equation for effective action for an arbitrary single scalar field theory, allowing us to perform computations without running in intermediate divergencies. We illustrate the method with the use of $\lambda\phi^4 + \phi^6/M^2$ theory by the explicit (and fully finite) calculations of the effective potential as well as two-, four- and six-point correlation functions at one loop level and demonstrate that no quantum corrections to scalar mass $m^2$, depending on $M^2$-scale, are generated.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Coset Construction for Spontaneously Broken Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Toric Duality in Brane Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a variety of machine learning methods to the study of Seiberg duality within 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ quantum field theories arising on the worldvolumes of D3-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. Such theories admit an elegant description in terms of bipartite tessellations of the torus known as brane tilings or dimer models. An intricate network of infrared dualities interconnects the space of such theories and partitions it into universality classes, the prediction and classification of which is a problem that naturally lends itself to a machine learning investigation. In this paper, we address a preliminary set of such enquiries. We begin by training a fully connected neural network to identify classes of Seiberg dual theories realised on $\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ orbifolds of the conifold and achieve $R^2=0.988$. Then, we evaluate various notions of robustness of our methods against perturbations of the space of theories under investigation, and discuss these results in terms of the nature of the neural network's learning. Finally, we employ a more sophisticated residual architecture to classify the toric phase space of the $Y^{6,0}$ theories, and to predict the individual gauged linear $\sigma$-model multiplicities in toric diagrams thereof. In spite of the non-trivial nature of this task, we achieve remarkably accurate results; namely, upon fixing a choice of Kasteleyn matrix representative, the regressor achieves a mean absolute error of $0.021$. We also discuss how the performance is affected by relaxing these assumptions.</description>

      <title>New slow-roll approximations for inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06147v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new slow-roll approximations for inflationary models with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We find more accurate expressions of the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To check the accuracy of approximations considered we construct inflationary models with quadratic and quartic monomial potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet term. Numerical analysis of these models indicates that the proposed inflationary scenarios do not contradict to the observation data. New slow-roll approximations show that the constructed inflationary models are in agreement with the observation data, whereas one does not get allowed observational parameters at the same values of parameters of the constructed models in the standard slow-roll approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field inflationary model with the induced gravity term. Using conformal transformation of the metric, we get the chiral cosmological model with two scalar fields. We demonstrate that the constructed inflationary model do not contradict to observation data and is suitable for primordial black hole (PBH) formation. The estimation of PBH masses allows to consider PBHs as dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies with non-formal pseudo-differential operators, non-formal solutions, and a Yang-Mills--like formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We start from the classical Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy posed on formal pseudo-differential operators, and we produce two hierarchies of non-linear equations posed on non-formal pseudo-differential operators lying in the Kontsevich and Vishik's odd class, one of them with values in formal pseudo-differential operators. We prove that the corresponding Zakharov-Shabat equations hold in this context, and we express one of our hierarchies as the minimization of a class of Yang-Mills action functionals on a space of pseudo-differential connections whose curvature takes values in the Dixmier ideal. We finish by comparing our Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies in terms of the solutions that they produce to the KP-II equation: existence, uniqueness and formality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After very little memories we review slightly Paul Frampton's memories from the discovery of Veneziano model being indeed string theory with Y. Nambu and secondly his 3-3-1 theory.This latter is an indeed not excluded replacement for the Standard Model with triangle anomalies cancelling as they must in a truly viable theory. It even needs (essentially) 3 as the family number! Also primordial black holes as dark matter is mentioned, we end with review of a my own very speculative utterly recent idea, that for the purpose of the classical approximation, we could, using the functional integral as our rudimentary assumption taken over from quantum mechanics, obtain the equations of motion without the in our opinion very mysterious imaginary unit i, which usually occurs as a factor in the exponent of the functional integrand, which is this i times the action. The functional integral without the mysterious i leads to predicting some of the most strong features in cosmology, and also seems to argue for as little black holes as possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the classical tests of general relativity is the precision measurements by Pound and Rebka of red-shift/blue-shift of photons in a gravitational field. In this essay, we lay out a temporal version of the Pound-Rebka experiment. The emission and absorption of photons occurs at different times, rather than at different spatial locations as in the original Pound-Rebka experiment. This temporal Pound-Rebka experiment is equivalent to a gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect and is testable via current or near future satellite experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian forecasting with information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting techniques for assessing the power of future experiments to discriminate between theories or discover new laws of nature are of great interest in many areas of science. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian forecasting method using information theory. We argue that mutual information is a suitable quantity to study in this context. Besides being Bayesian, this proposal has the advantage of not relying on the choice of fiducial parameters, describing the "true" theory (which is a priori unknown), and is applicable to any probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for parameter estimation and model selection, both of which are of interest concerning future experiments. We argue that mutual information has plausible interpretation in both situations. In addition, we state a number of propositions that offer information-theoretic meaning to some of the Bayesian practices such as performing multiple experiments, combining different datasets, and marginalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux, real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

Abstract: The BPS limit of the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model is considered in $(1+2)$-dimensions. The second order Bogomolny equation is examined in the presence of an inhomogeneity expressed as a function of spatial coordinates. Assuming a physically reasonable upper bound on the $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ norm of the inhomogeneity function, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of nontrivial BPS vacuum solution of zero energy and topological BPS multi-vortex solutions of quantized positive energies.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Novel Feature of Ellis Spacetime: Insights into Scalar Field Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied neutral and charged massive particles dynamics in Ellis spacetime in the presence of the external scalar field. Focusing on the circular motion of massive particles, the impact of an external scalar field on the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) position is analyzed, revealing a non-linear relationship with the scalar field parameter. Perturbation techniques are employed to investigate oscillatory motion near stable orbits in the Ellis spacetime, yielding analytical expressions for radial and angular oscillations. The throat of the wormhole has been constrained by comparing theoretical and observational results for fundamental frequencies of particles from quasars. Finally, scalar and gravitational perturbations in the Ellis spacetime have been studied. It is shown that the equation for the scalar profile function is fully independent from the tensor functions, and the solution can be represented in terms of the confluent Heun function. However, it has been shown that equations for the tensor profile functions strongly depend on the scalar profile functions in the Ellis spacetime, and they are reduced to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. Finally, numerical solutions to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation for the radial functions in the Ellis spacetime have been presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Searching for small primordial black holes in planets, asteroids and here on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering an ansatz for $1+3+n$ dimensional static spacetime with uniform $n$-branes stacked in three-dimensional rotationally symmetric space, we found different classes of vacuum solutions of Einstein field equations. We analyzed these solutions through the Newtonian limit, Kretschmann scalar, and conserved energy from Landau--Lifshitz stress-energy pseudotensor. This revealed unusual physical properties for a class of solutions with nontrivial extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with extra dimensions. Positive conserved energy is associated with repulsive gravity and physical singularity on the horizon, while negative conserved energy implies gravitational attraction and naked singularity. This sets the Schwarzschild solution in a broader context and provides new possible testing grounds for general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Let B be a spacetime region of width 2R &gt; 0, and \phi a vector state localized in B. We show that the vacuum relative entropy of \phi, on the local von Neumann algebra of B, is bounded by 2\pi R-times the energy of the state \phi in B. This bound is model-independent and rigorous; it follows solely from first principles in the framework of translation covariant, local Quantum Field Theory on the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Generic Modified Teukolsky Formalism beyond General Relativity for Spherically Symmetric Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has inaugurated a new era for testing gravitational theories in strong-field, nonlinear regimes. Gravitational waves emit during the ringdown phase of binary black hole mergers and from extreme mass ratio inspirals are particularly sensitive to the properties of black holes, making them crucial for probing deviations from general relativity. These studies need a robust foundation in black hole perturbation theory beyond general relativity. While existing studies have employed black hole perturbation theories to explore modifications beyond general relativity, they often focus on specific alternative theories or phenomenological models of quantum gravity. In this paper, we establish a modified decoupled Teukolsky formalism that is broadly applicable to spherically symmetric spacetimes without requiring a predetermined gravitational Lagrangian. This formalism uses the Newman-Penrose framework, which utilizes curvature perturbations characterized by Weyl scalars, to accommodate a wider class of spacetimes beyond general relativity. Our approach correctly handles non-Ricci-flat backgrounds and circumvents subtle analytical issues associated with effective potentials that are present in other modified Teukolsky formalisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized boson and fermion operators with a maximal total occupation property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new generalization of the standard (anti-)commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators of bosons and fermions. These relations preserve the usual symmetry properties of bosons and fermions. Only the standard (anti-)commutator relation involving one creation and one annihilation operator is deformed by introducing fractional coefficients, containing a positive integer parameter $p$. The Fock space is determined by the classical definition. The new relations are chosen in such a way that the total occupation number in the system has the maximum value $p$. From the actions of creation and annihilation operators in the Fock space, a group theoretical framework is determined, and from here the correspondence with known particle statistics is established.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.012\, 815 \, 967 \,259 \,511 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>

      <title>A swampland conjecture DESIder\'atum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key result of the string phenomenology framework is the two swampland conjectures (SCs), namely that the values of the scalar field excursion and gradient of the potential have to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in Planck units. Using the first data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and model-independent reconstructions of the SCs at late times, via a particular machine learning approach known as the genetic algorithms (GA), we find that the reconstructions of the SCs are, in fact, in agreement with their theoretical values of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Specifically, the reconstruction of the second SC is in fact several sigmas away from zero, thus indicating a very steep potential in contrast to recent model-specific analyses, assuming exponential potentials. Our approach is based solely on model-independent reconstructions of cosmological observables, such as the angular diameter distance and the Hubble expansion history, thus it is readily applicable to the forthcoming data from Stage IV surveys and will help settle in the near future the issue on the observational falsification, or not, of the two conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling we undertake a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model in equilibrium. We confirm that the loops threading excited plaquettes percolate at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$ and we show that their critical exponents coincide with the ones of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. We then construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters using a random-cluster representation and find that they also percolate at $T_c$ and moreover give access to all thermal critical exponents. The Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameter of both loops and FK clusters demonstrate a pseudo first order transition. This study sheds light on the critical properties of quantum error correction and lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Dilaton Weyl Multiplet of 4D, ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Conformal Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new dilaton Weyl multiplet of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. This is constructed by reinterpreting the equations of motion of an on-shell hypermultiplet as constraints that render some of the fields of the standard Weyl multiplet composite. The independent bosonic components include four scalar fields and a triplet of gauge two-forms. The resulting, so-called, hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet defines a $24+24$ off-shell representation of the local ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ superconformal algebra. By coupling the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet to an off-shell vector multiplet compensator, we obtain one of the two minimal $32+32$ off-shell multiplets of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity constructed by M\"uller in 1986. On-shell, this contains the minimal ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet together with a hypermultiplet where one of its physical scalars plays the role of a dilaton, while its three other scalars are dualised to a triplet of real gauge two-forms. Interestingly, a $BF$-coupling induces a scalar potential for the dilaton without a standard gauging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sonoluminescence is a well known laboratory phenomenon where an oscillating gas bubble in the appropriate environment periodically emits a flash of light in the visible frequency range. In this submission, we study the system in the framework of analog gravity. We model the oscillating bubble in terms of analog geometry and propose a non-minimal coupling prescription of the electromagnetic field with the geometry. The geometry behaves as an analogous oscillating time dependent background in which repeated flux of photons are produced in a wide frequency range through parametric resonance from quantum vacuum. Due to our numerical limitation, we could reach the frequency up to $\sim 10^5 ~\mbox{m}^{-1}$. However, we numerically fit the spectrum in a polynomial form including the observed frequency range around $\sim 10^7 ~\mbox{m}^{-1}$. Our current analysis seems to suggest that parametric resonance in analog background may play a fundamental role in explaining such phenomena in the quantum field theory framework.</description>

Abstract: We take a step toward a "microscopic" derivation of gauge-string duality. In particular, using mathematical techniques of Strebel differentials and discrete exterior calculus, we obtain a bosonic string worldsheet action for a string embedded in d+1 dimensional asymptotically AdS space from multi-loop Feynman graphs of a quantum field theory of scalar matrices in d-dimensions in the limit of diverging loop number. Our work is building on the program started by 't Hooft in 1974, this time including the holographic dimension which we show to emerge from the continuum of Schwinger parameters of Feynman diagrams.</description>

Abstract: String theory on AdS${}_3\times$ S${}^3\times$ T${}^4$ geometries supported by a combination of NS-NS and R-R charges is believed to be integrable. We elucidate the kinematics and analytic structure of worldsheet excitations in mixed charge and pure NS-NS backgrounds, when expressed in momentum, Zhukovsky variables and the rapidity $u$ which appears in the quantum spectral curve. We discuss the relations between fundamental and bound state excitations and the role of fusion in constraining and determining the S matrices of these theories. We propose a scalar dressing factor consistent with a novel $u$-plane periodicity and comment on its close relation to the XXZ model at roots of unity. We solve the odd part of crossing and show that our solution is consistent with fusion and reduces in the relativistic limit to dressing phases previously found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dualities for Heterotic and Type I Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define generalized dualities for heterotic and type I strings based on consistent truncations to half-maximal gauged supergravities in more than three dimensions. The latter are constructed from a generalized Scherk-Schwarz ansatz in heterotic double field theory that satisfies the strong constraint. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the resulting embedding tensor are discussed, showing that only certain gaugings, called geometric, can arise from this procedure. For all of them, we explicitly construct the internal geometry and gauge potentials. In general, this construction is not unique and permits different uplifts which are used to define generalized T-duality. Two examples are worked out underlying the utility of our approach to explore new dualities and uplifts of half-maximal gauged supergravities.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent gravitational background is well known as a theoretical laboratory for quantum mechanical particle production. In the present analysis, we explore such production in a time-dependent analog system. This is the follow-up of our earlier study on the Sonoluminescence phenomenon, which is modelled in terms of analog geometry coupled with the electromagnetic field exhibiting the quantum production of photons. In the same analog geometry, we studied fermion production. Although fermions have not been observed yet in the sonoluminescence experiment, we have shown here that such a system can produce a repeated flux of fermions via the parametric resonance from a quantum vacuum. Our analysis seems to suggest that in the laboratory setup, time-dependent analog systems could be an interesting playground where phenomena of quantum mechanical particle production can be observed.</description>

      <title>Total and Symmetry resolved Entanglement spectra in some Fermionic CFTs from the BCFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the universal total and symmetry-resolved entanglement spectra for a single interval of some $2$d Fermionic CFTs using the Boundary Conformal Field theory (BCFT) approach. In this approach, the partition of Hilbert space is achieved by cutting out discs around the entangling boundary points and imposing boundary conditions preserving the extended symmetry under scrutiny. The reduced density moments are then related to the BCFT partition functions and are also found to be diagonal in the symmetry charge sectors. In particular, we first study the entanglement spectra of massless Dirac fermion and modular invariant $Z_2$-gauged Dirac fermion by considering the boundary conditions preserving either the axial or the vector $U(1)$ symmetry. The total entanglement spectra of the modular invariant Dirac fermion are shown to match with the compact boson result at the Bose-Fermi duality radius, while for the massless Dirac fermion, it is found that the boundary entropy term doesn't match with the self-dual compact boson. The symmetry-resolved entanglement is found to be the same in all cases, except for the charge spectrum which is dependent on both the symmetry and the theory. We also study the entanglement spectra of $N$ massless Dirac fermions by considering boundary conditions preserving different chiral $U(1)^N$ symmetries. Entanglement spectra are studied for $U(1)^M$ subgroups, where $M\leq N$, by imposing boundary conditions preserving different chiral symmetries. The total entanglement spectra are found to be sensitive to the representations of the $U(1)^M$ symmetry in the boundary theory among other behaviours at $O(1)$. Similar results are also found for the Symmetry resolved entanglement entropies. The characteristic $\log\log\left(\ell/\epsilon\right)$ term of the $U(1)$ symmetry is found to be proportional to $M$ in the symmetry-resolved entanglement spectra.</description>

Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

      <title>Quantum focusing conjecture in two-dimensional evaporating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) for two-dimensional evaporating black holes. The QFC is closely related to the behavior of the generalized entropy -- the sum of the area entropy for a given co-dimension two surface and the entanglement entropy for quantum fields outside the area. In the context of the black hole evaporation, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is decreasing after the Page time, and therefore it is not obvious whether the QFC holds in the black hole evaporation process especially after the Page time. One of the present authors previously addressed this problem in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical black hole model and showed that the QFC is satisfied. However the background spacetime considered was approximated by the Vaidya metric, and quantum effects of matters in the semiclassical regime is not fully taken into consideration. It remains to be seen if the QFC in fact holds for exact solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this paper, we address this problem in a two-dimensional dynamical black hole of the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius (RST) model, which allows us to solve the semiclassical equations of motion exactly. We first give a suitable definition of the quantum expansion in two-dimensions and then prove that the QFC is satisfied for evaporating black holes in the RST model with the island formation taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy of local-operator-excited states for replica index $n$ can be a sign of quantum chaos. As concrete examples, we analyze the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in various two-dimensional conformal field theories. We show that there are always logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in holographic CFTs, but no such singularities in free and rational CFTs. These singularities of the Renyi entropy are also related to the logarithmic time growth of the Renyi entropy at late times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory with cubic anisotropic symmetry in presence of a line defect. We compute the correlators of the low lying defect operators using Feynman diagrams and derive explicit expressions for the two, three and four point defect correlators at the cubic fixed point in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions to $O(\epsilon)$. We also compute the defect $g$-function for this setup and demonstrate that this is in agreement with the $g$-theorem, which states that the $g$-function is monotonic under the renormalisation group flow along the defect. Next, we focus on conformal bootstrap techniques to determine the CFT data associated with the defect operators, which is the main objective of the paper. We utilize the framework of crossing symmetric Polyakov bootstrap and compute the averaged CFT data to $O(\epsilon)$ up to a finite number of ambiguities. We comment on unmixing the CFT data for the double trace operators at $O(\epsilon)$ and use this to compute the $O(\epsilon^2)$ data. Finally, we study these defect correlators non-perturbatively using numerical methods and isolate them near the free theory limit close to four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of Maxwell theory admit a 0-form symmetry compatible with the classical $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ duality of electromagnetism. We describe how to realize these automorphisms of the SymTFT in terms of its operators and we detail their effects on the dynamical theory and its global variants. In the process, we show that the classical $U(1)$ symmetry, corresponding to the stabilizer of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, can be restored as a non-invertible one, by means of an infinite series of discrete gauging. This provides an example of the reemergence of a classical symmetry in the quantum regime, which was not broken by anomalies, but rather by the quantization of electromagnetic fluxes. However, this procedure comes at the price of introducing "continuous" condensates that trivialize all line operators.</description>

Abstract: The Coulomb and Higgs indices of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $U(N)$ ADHM theories can be decorated by line defect operators as the line defect correlators. We obtain exact closed-form expressions and various non-trivial algebraic relations for the correlators of the Wilson lines in the fundamental and (anti)symmetric representations by means of the Hall-Littlewood expansion, the Fermi-gas method and the residue calculation. From the large $N$ limit of the correlators we obtain the single particle gravity indices which are expected to encode the spectra of fluctuation modes on the gravity duals of line operators in M2-brane SCFTs.</description>

Abstract: Arkani-Hamed and collaborators have recently shown that scattering amplitudes for colored theories can be expressed as integrals over combinatorial objects simply constructed from surfaces decorated by kinematic data. In this paper we extend the curve integral formalism to theories with colored fermionic matter and present a compact formula for the all-loop, all-genus, all-multiplicity amplitude integrand of a colored Yukawa theory. The curve integral formalism makes certain properties of the amplitudes manifest and repackages non-trivial numerators into a single combinatorial object. We also present an efficient formula for $L$-loop integrated amplitudes in terms of a sum over $2^L$ combinatorial determinants.</description>

Abstract: We consider two explicit constructions of states in the orbifolds of a product of Minimal $N=(2,2)$ models which are based on twisting by spectral flow, mutual locality and operator algebra requirement. It is shown that these two constructions lead to the Berglund-Hubsh-Krawitz dual orbifold groups which define mirror pairs of isomorphic models. Then we generalize our construction for the orbifolds of Gepner models of superstring compactification and explicitly build IIA/IIB mirror map of the space of states of the superstrings using light-cone gauge.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the AdS/CFT correspondence framework, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate quantum corrections to the symmetry generators for the transversity operators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the two-loop approximation. Using this result, we obtain the evolution kernel for the corresponding operators at three loops. The explicit expression for the anomalous dimension matrix in the Gegenbauer basis is given for the first few operators.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)~\mathrm{meV}$ satisfying the swampland constraints are predicted, a testable prospect for string phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the bicrossproduct structure of the quantum group $\varrho$-Poincar\'e and of the dual quantum universal enveloping algebra, expanding the construction to general Lie algebra-type deformations of Poincar\'e coming from classical $r$-matrices. We review the relation between different bases of the quantum universal enveloping algebra of $\varrho$-Poincar\'e and noncommutative $\star$-products defined on the $\varrho$-Minkowski spacetime, analysing some of their relevant features. Furthermore, we comment on the role of physical bases and introduce the $\varrho$-Poincar\'e quantum Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

Abstract: This paper emphasizes the ubiquitous role of moduli spaces of algebraic curves in associative algebra and algebraic topology. The main results are: (1) the space of an operad with multiplication is a homotopy Gerstenhaber (i.e., homotopy graded Poisson) algebra; (2) the singular cochain complex is naturally an operad; (3) the operad of decorated moduli spaces acts naturally on the de Rham complex $\Omega^\bullet X$ of a K\"{a}hler manifold $X$, thereby yielding the most general type of homotopy G-algebra structure on $\Omega^\bullet X$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scalar Production At Large Center-Of-Mass Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, the probability of producing scalar particles grows factorially as a function of the number of the particles produced. This poses a problem theoretically, in maintaining unitarity, and is counter-intuitive phenomenologically. The factorial growth is a byproduct of the perturbation theory, but has been found in some of the semi-classical and non-perturbative calculations as well. Recently, it has been proposed that the factorial growth might be observable in the future 100 TeV hadron collider. After reviewing some of the past calculations, we analyze the cancelation of IR divergences to find Altarelli-Parisi function and the Sudakov form factor. We then use these to write an equation for the generating function of scalar jet rates. We further argue that we can turn the jet rates into particle cross section by swapping the opening angle with particle mass. We will present our results for $\phi^3$ theory in four and six spacetime dimensions, and $\phi^4$ in four spacetime dimensions. We find that, while the final particles are relativistic, the cross sections do not grow factorially.</description>

      <title>A simple model for strange metallic behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A refined semi-holographic non-Fermi liquid model, in which carrier electrons hybridize with operators of a holographic critical sector, has been proposed recently for strange metallic behavior. The model, consistently with effective theory approach, has two couplings whose ratio is related to the doping. We explain the origin of the linear-in-T resistivity and strange metallic behavior as a consequence of the emergence of a universal form of the spectral function which is independent of the model parameters when the ratio of the two couplings take optimal values determined only by the critical exponent. This universal form fits well with photoemission data of copper oxide samples for under/optimal/over-doping with a fixed exponent over a wide range of temperatures. We further obtain a refined Planckian dissipation scenario in which the scattering time $\tau = f \cdot \hbar /(k_B T)$, with $f$ being $\mathcal{O}(1)$ at strong coupling, but $\mathcal{O}(10)$ at weak coupling.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak Coupling Lattice Duality in Non-Local QFT with Application to Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the method of obtaining strong coupling regime expansions for a set of Euclidean Quantum Field Theories on a general lattice, illustrated through a self-interacting scalar field $g^4 \phi^4 / 4!$ on a cubic lattice of arbitrary dimensions. A duality is established between the strong coupling regime of this theory and the weak coupling regime of a corresponding dual theory. For Ising model, it corresponds to other choice of field-theoretical description of the same spin partition function. While the original theory is local, its dual counterpart is non-local. Using Feynman diagrammatic techniques for the dual theory, expansions for the two-point correlator and the free energy per site in the region of large and medium coupling constants $g$ are derived. These expansions appear to be regular as $g \rightarrow 0$ and they require no cumbersome calculations for derivation. Furthermore, they demonstrate sufficiently rapid numerical convergence in the regions of large and medium coupling values. Numerical analysis in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=3$ shows agreement with analytical results from Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, the strong coupling regime expansions are consistent with traditional weak coupling expansions. Unfortunately, this duality does not trivially extend to continuous theories, hence they are not considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Quantum K theory of Grassmannians, Wilson line operators, and Schur bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a `Whitney' presentation, and a `Coulomb branch' presentation, for the torus equivariant quantum K theory of the Grassmann manifold $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, inspired from physics, and stated in an earlier paper. The first presentation is obtained by quantum deforming the product of the Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the tautological bundles. In physics, the $\lambda_y$ classes arise as certain Wilson line operators. The second presentation is obtained from the Coulomb branch equations involving the partial derivatives of a twisted superpotential from supersymmetric gauge theory. This is closest to a presentation obtained by Gorbounov and Korff, utilizing integrable systems techniques. Algebraically, we relate the Coulomb and Whitney presentations utilizing transition matrices from the (equivariant) Grothendieck polynomials to the (equivariant) complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. Along the way, we calculate K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of wedge powers of the tautological bundles on $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, using the `quantum=classical' statement.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Energy-Conserving Quantum Circuits with XY interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits constructed from $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX+YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX+YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving 2-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a peculiar connection between particles, underpins powerful technologies such as quantum computing and secure communication. However, quantifying the minimum entanglement required to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes remains a significant challenge. We develop an efficiently computable tool that reliably estimates the amount of entanglement needed for realizing arbitrary quantum processes respecting certain physical principles. Our tool applies to the entanglement required to prepare a broad range of quantum states in the asymptotic regime, surpassing previous methods' limitations. We also confirm that entanglement, once consumed to realize the considered class of quantum operations, cannot be fully recovered, even asymptotically. This irreversible behavior is evident for full-rank entangled states and practically relevant amplitude damping channels, even under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose. We showcase our approach's power through examples such as estimating entanglement requirements for realizing bipartite dephasing SWAP channels and solving Hamiltonian simulations under thermal interaction, highlighting its advantages over existing techniques. Our work provides a practical toolkit for benchmarking entanglement requirements for generic states and quantum dynamics, paving the way for assessing and optimizing the performances of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Floer theory I: exponential integrals in finite and infinite dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first of the series of papers devoted to our project ``Holomorphic Floer Theory" we discuss exponential integrals and related wall-crossing structures. We emphasize two points of view on the subject: the one based on the ideas of deformation quantization and the one based on the ideas of Floer theory. Their equivalence is a corollary of our generalized Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In the case of exponential integrals this amounts to several comparison isomorphisms between local and global versions of de Rham and Betti cohomology. We develop the corresponding theories in particular generalizing Morse-Novikov theory to the holomorphic case. We prove that arising wall-crossing structures are analytic. As a corollary, perturbative expansions of exponential integrals are resurgent. Based on a careful study of finite-dimensional exponential integrals we propose a conjectural approach to infinite-dimensional exponential integrals. We illustrate this approach in the case of Feynman path integral with holomorphic Lagrangian boundary conditions as well as in the case of the complexified Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the arising perverse sheaf of infinite rank as well as analyticity of the corresponding ``Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure". We develop a general theory of quantum wave functions and show that in the case of Chern-Simons theory it gives an alternative description of the Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure based on the notion of generalized Nahm sum. We propose several conjectures about analyticity and resurgence of the corresponding perturbative series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the complete complementarity relations (CCR) to fully characterize various aspects of quantumness in QED scattering processes at tree level. As a paradigmatic example, we consider Bhabha scattering in two different configurations: in the first case, the initial state is factorized in the spin and we study the generation of entanglement due to the scattering. Then we consider the most general case in which the initial state can be entangled: we find that the scattering generates and distributes quantum information in a non-trivial way among the spin degrees of freedom of the particles, with CCR relations being preserved. An important outcome of our analysis is that maximal entanglement is conserved in the scattering process involving only fermions as input and output states, with a more complex situation if photons are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of matter-gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension, since it induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. The effects of a time varying gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <title>General geometry realized by four-scalar model and application to $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model including four scalar fields coupled with general gravity theories, which is a generalization of the two-scalar model proposed in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{103} (2021) no.4, 044055, where it has been shown that any given spherically symmetric static/time-dependent spacetime can be realized by using the two-scalar model. We show that by using the four-scalar model, we can construct a model that realizes any given spacetime as a solution even if the spacetime does not have a spherical symmetry or any other symmetry. We also show that by imposing constraints on the scalar fields by using the Lagrange multiplier fields, the scalar fields become non-dynamical and they do not propagate. This tells that there does not appear any sound which is usually generated by the density fluctuation of the fluid. In this sense, the model with the constraints is a most general extension of the mimetic theory in JHEP \textbf{11} (2013), 135, where there appears an effective dark matter. The dark matter is non-dynamical and it does not collapse even under gravitational force. Our model can be regarded as a general extension of any kind of fluid besides dark matter. We may consider the case that the potential of the scalar fields vanishes and the model becomes a non-linear $\sigma$ model. Then our formulation gives a mapping from the geometry of the spacetime to the geometry of the target space of the non-linear $\sigma$ model via gravity theory although the physical meaning has not been clear. We also consider the application of the model to $f(Q)$ gravity theory, which is based on a non-metricity tensor and $Q$ is a scalar quantity constructed from the non-metricity tensor. ...</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>

Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear in large families of gapless states of quantum matter and constrain their low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <title>The Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect in inflationary cosmological perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplest model of inflation is based around an inflaton field that starts in a coherent false vacuum state with a positive cosmological constant, rolls slowly to the true vacuum and relaxes to it via reheating. We examine whether the scale of the transition from coherence to chaoticity can be examined via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, in parallel with analogous problems of heavy ion physics (the ``pion laser'' and the thermalizing glasma).
  We develop an ansatz which contains a definition of ''chaoticity'' which parallels that of the usual setups where HBT is used.
  However, we also discuss the differences between the inflationary setup and more mainstream uses of HBT and conclude that these are more significant than the similarities, making the use of the developed methodology uncertain.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This changed with the recent work of Dragan and Ekert, who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM), since they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. In fact, both classical and quantum field theory of tachyons have been constructed. Unfortunately, we will show that the latter theory contains several flaws, mostly caused by adapting incorrect results due to other authors, which puts the aforementioned program in question. In particular, unlike Feinberg, we show that tachyon microcausality violation spoils fundamental features of QFT such as statistical independence of distant measurements, and it negatively affects constructing Lorentz invariant scattering theory of tachyons. Moreover, the Feynman propagator, which was adapted from Dhar and Sudarshan, is shown to violate unitarity, the tachyonic vacuum is unstable due to radiatively generated tachyon self-interactions, and an interpolating tachyon field likely does not satisfy the LSZ asymptotic condition. Our analysis indicates that a covariant QFT of tachyons seems impossible, hence superluminal observers are unphysical and cannot be used to derive QM.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Improving Mimetic Gravity with Non-trivial Scalar Potential: Cosmology, Black Holes, Shadow and Photon Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is not easy to treat the spacetime with horizon(s) in the standard mimetic gravity. The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830 (2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier constraint.
  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the cosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the scalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for the above theories are presented as specific examples from the general reconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history via the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two black hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are constructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black holes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius with the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is demonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems. It is shown how the counterpart of Carter constant emerges as a result of coupling-constant metamorphosis.

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>
