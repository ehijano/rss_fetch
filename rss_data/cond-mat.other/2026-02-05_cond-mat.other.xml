      <title>Electronic Structure of CaSnN$_2$: a sustainable alternative for blue LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of CaSnN2 in the wurtzite-based Pna21 structure is calculated using the Quasiparticle Self-consistent (QS)GW$^{BSE}$ method, including ladder diagrams in the screened Coulomb interaction W$^{BSE}$ and is found to have a direct gap of 2.680 eV at {\Gamma}, which corresponds to blue light wavelength of 463 nm and makes it an attractive candidate for sustainable blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), avoiding Ga and In. The valence band maximum has a1 symmetry and gives allowed transitions to the conduction band minimum for light polarized along the c-direction. The valence band splitting is analyzed in terms of symmetry labeling, and the effective mass tensor is calculated for several bands at {\Gamma}. The optical dielectric function, including electron-hole interaction effects is also reported, and the excitons are analyzed, including several dark excitons.</description>

      <title>Robust, High-Contrast, Recyclable Zinc-Based Dynamic Windows via Synergistic Electrolyte and Interfacial Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zinc-based electrochromic devices offer a sustainable route for dynamic optical management but are plagued by poor cycling stability due to irreversible zinc plating/stripping and side reactions. Herein, we report a robust, high-contrast, and recyclable zinc-based dynamic window enabled by a synergistic electrolyte and interfacial engineering strategy. Molecular dynamics simulations and electrochemical analyses reveal a dual-ion cooperative mechanism that governs the reversibility: anions with the strongest binding affinity guide uniform Zn deposition by stabilizing the inner solvation shell, while formate anions co-enriched at the interface facilitate smooth stripping via protonation during the oxidation process. This orchestrated interplay effectively eliminates "dead Zn" accumulation and dendrite growth. Consequently, the device demonstrates a record-high lifespan of 15,000 cycles with negligible degradation and maintains a large optical modulation of &gt;50%, along with multiple optical states (transparent, gray, black, and mirror). Furthermore, it achieves a large reflectance modulation (&gt;50%) stable for over 2,000 cycles. This work establishes the recyclable zinc-based dynamic window as a scalable, high-performance alternative to conventional electrochromic systems, advancing the feasibility of solution-processed energy-saving windows in sustainable buildings.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Polarization-Controlled Magnetization Switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric-field driven magnetization switching in FePt/BaTiO$_3$ (001) is demonstrated through first-principles calculations. The magnetic easy axis of FePt layer undergoes a transition from in-plane to perpendicular direction upon ferroelectric polarization reversal, a process sensitively controlled by epitaxial strain with threshold strain strain($\eta$) $\eta\approx\%$. At this phenomena, a large interfacial magnetoelectric coupling ($\alpha_I = 3.6 \times 10^{-10}$ G$\cdot$cm$^2$/V) is responsible, stemming from the orbital reconstruction. In particular, the redistribution of Pt-$d$ orbital occupancy alters spin-orbit coupling, thereby tuning the competition between magnetic anisotropy ($K_i$) and magnetoelastic energy ($b_1$). Our work clarifies the fundamental physics of strain-engineered magnetoelectricity and suggests a concrete pathway for designing ultra-low-power voltage-controlled magnetic memory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</description>
