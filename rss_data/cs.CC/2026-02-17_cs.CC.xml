      <title>Computability of Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Quest Graph, a formal framework for analyzing the capabilities of agentic systems with finite context. We define abstractions that model common reasoning techniques and establish their computational power: the base Quest Graph is equivalent to an unrestricted Turing machine; the forward-only Finite Quest Decision Process (FQDP), despite its wide use, is only equivalent to a pushdown automaton (context-free); and the Reference-Augmented QDP (RQDP) regains Turing completeness only when stateful queries are allowed.
  Since computability affects efficiency, we then analyze the theoretical efficiency of each model by simulating task dependencies in computation graphs. We show that this computational hierarchy translates to concrete performance trade-offs: reference-augmented (Turing-complete) systems can be exponentially more efficient at simulating complex graphs than their non-augmented (context-free) counterparts. This work provides a formal methodology for classifying and understanding the fundamental capabilities of agentic systems.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Rigidity Framework for Order-Oblivious Deterministic Black-Box PIT of ROABPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic black-box polynomial identity testing (PIT) for read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs) is a central open problem in algebraic complexity, particularly in the absence of variable ordering. Prior deterministic algorithms either rely on order information or incur significant overhead through combinatorial isolation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce an algebraic rigidity framework for ROABPs based on the internal structure of their associated matrix word algebras. We show that nonzero width-$w$ ROABPs induce word algebras whose effective algebraic degrees of freedom collapse to dimension at most $w^2$, independent of the number of variables. This rigidity enables deterministic witness construction via intrinsic algebraic invariants, bypassing rank concentration, isolation lemmas, and probabilistic tools used in previous work.Thus, we obtain the first order-oblivious deterministic black-box PIT algorithm for ROABPs, running in quasi-polynomial time $n\cdot(wd)^{O(w^2)}$. This establishes that algebraic rigidity alone suffices to derandomize PIT in this model, without assuming ordering information.
  The framework further isolates a single remaining obstacle to full polynomial-time complexity. We formulate a Modular Stability Conjecture, asserting that width-$w$ ROABPs are stable under hashing into cyclic quotient rings $\mathbb{K}[\lambda]/&lt; \lambda^r-1 &gt;$ once the modulus exceeds a polynomial threshold in $w$ and the individual degree. This conjecture arises naturally from the low-dimensional coefficient structure revealed by rigidity and is supported by extensive empirical evidence.
  Assuming the conjecture, our methods yield a fully polynomial-time deterministic black-box PIT algorithm for ROABPs, matching the complexity of the best-known white-box algorithms and reducing the black-box problem to a concrete algebraic stability question.</description>

      <title>Affine Rank Minimization is ER Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decision problem Affine Rank Minimization, denoted ARM(k). The input consists of rational matrices A_1,...,A_q in Q^{m x n} and rational scalars b_1,...,b_q in Q. The question is whether there exists a real matrix X in R^{m x n} such that trace(A_l^T X) = b_l for all l in {1,...,q} and rank(X) &lt;= k. We first prove membership: for every fixed k &gt;= 1, ARM(k) lies in the existential theory of the reals by giving an explicit existential encoding of the rank constraint using a constant-size factorization witness. We then prove existential-theory-of-reals hardness via a polynomial-time many-one reduction from ETR to ARM(k), where the target instance uses only affine equalities together with a single global constraint rank(X) &lt;= k. The reduction compiles an ETR formula into an arithmetic circuit in gate-equality normal form and assigns each circuit quantity to a designated entry of X. Affine semantics (constants, copies, addition, and negation) are enforced by linear constraints, while multiplicative semantics are enforced by constant-size rank-forcing gadgets. Soundness is certified by a fixed-rank gauge submatrix that removes factorization ambiguity. We prove a composition lemma showing that gadgets can be embedded without unintended interactions, yielding global soundness and completeness while preserving polynomial bounds on dimension and bit-length. Consequently, ARM(k) is complete for the existential theory of the reals; in particular, ARM(3) is complete. This shows that feasibility of purely affine constraints under a fixed constant rank bound captures the full expressive power of real algebraic feasibility.</description>

      <title>Graph Homomorphisms and Universal Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems are computational problems that naturally appear in many areas of theoretical computer science. One of the central themes is their computational complexity, and in particular the border between polynomial-time tractability and NP-hardness. In this course we introduce the universal-algebraic approach to study the computational complexity of finite-domain CSPs. The course covers in particular the cyclic terms and bounded width theorems. To keep the presentation accessible, we start the course in the tangible setting of directed graphs and graph homomorphism problems.</description>

      <title>The antiferromagnetic Ising model beyond line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the antiferromagnetic Ising model and the hard-core model could be said to be tractable on line graphs of bounded degree. For example, Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing in both cases. In the case of the hard-core model, we know that tractability extends further, to claw-free graphs and somewhat beyond. In contrast, it is shown here that the corresponding extensions are not possible in the case of the antiferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Complexity for Quantum Problems from Size-Preserving Circuit-to-Hamiltonian Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local Hamiltonian (LH) problem is the canonical $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem introduced by Kitaev. In this paper, we show its hardness in a very strong sense: we show that the 3-local Hamiltonian problem on $n$ qubits cannot be solved classically in time $O(2^{(1-\varepsilon)n})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), and cannot be solved quantumly in time $O(2^{(1-\varepsilon)n/2})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ under the Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (QSETH). These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved.
  Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime.
  To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits. This improves the standard construction based on the unary clock, which uses $N+O(T)$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characterization of Context-Free Intersections via the Inner Segment Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of two context-free languages is not generally context-free, but no geometric criterion has characterized when it remains so. The crossing gap (max(i'-i, j'-j) for two crossing push-pop arcs) is the natural candidate. We refute this: we exhibit CFLs whose intersection is CFL despite unbounded-gap crossings. The governing quantity is the inner segment measure: for crossing arcs inducing a decomposition w = P1 P2 P3 P4, it is max(|P2|,|P3|), the length of the longer inner segment between interleaved crossing endpoints. We prove a dichotomy for this measure: bounded inner segments imply context-freeness via a finite buffer construction; growing inner segments with pump-sensitive linkages imply non-context-freeness. The inner segment concept applies to all CFL intersections; the strictness of the resulting characterization depends on the language class. For block-counting CFLs (languages requiring equality among designated pairs of block lengths), the dichotomy is complete: the intersection is CFL if and only if the combined arcs are jointly well-nested. For general CFLs, the CFL direction is unconditional; the non-CFL direction requires pump-sensitive linkages whose necessity is the main open problem, reducing the general CFL intersection problem to a specific property of pump-sensitive decompositions.</description>

      <title>Graded Projection Recursion (GPR): A Framework for Controlling Bit-Complexity of Algebraic Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Graded Projection Recursion (GPR), a framework for converting certain blocked recursive algorithms into model-honest (i.e., reflects full bit complexity) near-quadratic procedures under bounded intermediate budgets. Part I gives a proof-complete {\em integral specification} of a three-band packing identity and a two-round middle-band extractor, and shows how per-node centering and sqrt-free dyadic l2 normalization (recursive invariant amplification) gives a sufficient packing base that grows linearly with the scaling depth (i.e., logarithmic bit-growth) in exact arithmetic.
  On fixed-width hardware, exact evaluation of the packed recursion generally requires either an extended-precision path or digit-band (slice) staging} that emulates b(n) bits of mantissa precision using w-bit words, incurring only polylogarithmic overhead; This leads to a soft-quadratic bit cost O(n^2) when b(n)=\Theta(\log n) in the basic 2x2 recursion). Part II introduces execution-format comparators (e.g., IEEE-754), a drift ledger, and a decision-invariance theorem that supports commensurate-accuracy claims in floating arithmetic (and that cleanly accounts for any staged/truncated auxiliary drift). Part III provides case-study reductions (LUP/solve/det/inv, LDL^T, blocked QR, SOI/SPD functions, GSEVP, dense LP/SDP IPM kernels, Gaussian process regression, and representative semiring problems) showing how to export the kernel advantage without reintroducing uncontrolled intermediate growth. Part IV abstracts admissible packings and extractors via a master condition and an easily checkable BWBM sufficient condition, and sketches extensions to multilinear/multigraded kernels and non-rounding extractors (e.g., CRT and semiring bucket projections).</description>

      <title>Implementation of Polynomial NP-Complete Algorithms Based on the NP Verifier Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While prior work established a verifier-based polynomial-time framework for NP, explicit deterministic machines for concrete NP-complete problems have remained elusive. In this paper, we construct fully specified deterministic Turing Machines (DTMs) for \textsc{SAT} and \textsc{Subset-Sum} within an improved NP verifier simulation framework. A key contribution of this work is the development of a functional implementation that bridges the gap between theoretical proofs and executable software. Our improved feasible-graph construction yields a genuine reduction in the asymptotic polynomial degree, while optimized edge-extension mechanisms significantly improve practical execution speed. We show that these machines generate valid witnesses, extending the framework to deterministic \textsc{FNP} computation without increasing complexity. The complete Python implementation behaves in accordance with the predicted polynomial-time bounds, and the source code along with sample instances are available in a public online repository.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Critical Node Cut Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to sparsify connectivity in graphs under a tight deletion budget. Given a graph $G$ and integers $k,x \ge 0$, Critical Node Cut (CNC) asks whether we can delete at most $k$ vertices so that the number of remaining unordered pairs of connected vertices is at most $x$. CNC generalizes Vertex Cover (the case $x=0$) and models tasks in network design, epidemiology, and social network analysis. We comprehensively map the structural parameterized complexity landscape for Critical Node Cut. First, we prove W[1]-hardness for the combined parameter $k + \mathrm{fes} + \Delta + \mathrm{pw}$, where $\mathrm{fes}$ is the feedback edge set number, $\Delta$ the maximum degree, and $\mathrm{pw}$ the pathwidth of the input graph respectively. This significantly improves over the known W[1]-hardness for $k+\mathrm{tw}$, where $\mathrm{tw}$ denotes the treewidth, and is tight in that tree-depth together with maximum degree trivially yields FPT. Second, we give new positive results. Specifically, we identify three structural parameters--max-leaf number, vertex integrity, and modular-width--that render the problem fixed-parameter tractable, and develop a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs of constant clique-width. Third, leveraging a technique introduced by Lampis~[ICALP '14], we develop an FPT approximation scheme that, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in time $(\mathrm{tw} / \varepsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{tw})} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, where $\mathrm{tw}$ denotes the treewidth of the input graph. Finally, we show that CNC admits no polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number, unless standard assumptions fail. Together, these results substantially sharpen the known complexity landscape for CNC.</description>

      <title>The Serial Scaling Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential. These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical simulations to sequential decision-making-require sequentially dependent computational steps that cannot be efficiently parallelized. We formalize this distinction in complexity theory, and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks. Then, we show for first time that diffusion models despite their sequential nature are incapable of solving inherently serial problems. We argue that recognizing the serial nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model design, and hardware development.</description>
