      <title>Limit curve theorems for incomplete metric spaces and the null distance on Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a limit curve theorem for incomplete metric spaces. Our main application is to Sormani and Vegas' null distance, where our results give strong control on the Lorentzian lengths of limit curves. We also show that regular cosmological time functions and the surface function of a Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic manifold define such a null distance.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by circles whose Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs are trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by circles are fundamental geometric and combinatorial objects. Related studies have been done and we cannot explain them precisely, or roughly, well.
  We study such regions whose Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs are trees and investigate the trees obtained by a certain inductive rule from a disk in the plane. The Poincar\'e-Reeb graph of such a region is a graph whose underlying set is the set of all components of level sets of the restriction of the canonical projection to the closure and whose vertices are points corresponding to the components containing {\it singular} points. Related studies were started by the author, motivated by importance and difficulty of explicit construction of a real algebraic map onto a prescribed closed region in the plane.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and Secrecy under Approximate Distance Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>A new method for generalizing non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surface is considered flexible if it allows a continuous deformation that preserves both metric and smoothness. We introduce a novel construction method, called 'base + crinkle,' for generating a broad class of non-self-intersecting flexible closed polyhedral surfaces (i.e. flexible polyhedra). These flexible polyhedra can be non-triangulated, exhibit multiple kinematic degrees of freedom, and possess topologies beyond the sphere. The geometric result provides fresh insights into the geometry of origami and the design of engineering mechanisms, such as sealed-chamber robotics and distortion-free metamorphic grippers.</description>

      <title>Old problem revisited: Which equilateral convex polygons tile the plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simplified proof of a forty-year-old result concerning the tiling of the plane with equilateral convex polygons. Our approach is based on a theorem by M. Rao, who used an exhaustive computer search to confirm the completeness of the well-known list of fifteen pentagon types. Assuming the validity of Rao's result, we provide a concise and mainly geometric proof of a tiling theorem originally due to Hirschhorn and Hunt. Finally, a possible connection to quasicrystals is sketched.</description>

      <title>A four-dimensional body of constant width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of bodies of constant width is a classical subject in convex geometry, with the three-dimensional Meissner bodies being canonical examples. This paper presents a novel geometric construction of a body of constant width in $R^4$, addressing the challenge of constructing such bodies in higher dimensions. Our method produces a natural analogue of the second Meissner body, by modifying a 4-dimensional Reuleaux simplex. The resulting body possesses tetrahedral symmetry and has a boundary composed of both smooth surfaces and a non-smooth subset of the Reuleaux 4-simplex. Furthermore, we analyze the orthogonal projection of this body onto the 3-dimensional hyperplane of its base. This "shadow" is a new 3-dimensional body of constant width with tetrahedral symmetry. It has six elliptical edges and we estimate its volume to be only slightly larger than that of the Meissner bodies.</description>

      <title>Polygons of unit area with vertices in sets of infinite planar measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paul Erd\H{o}s and R. Daniel Mauldin asked a series of questions on certain types of polygons of area $1$, the vertices of which can be found in every planar set of infinite Lebesgue measure. We address two of these questions, one on cyclic quadrilaterals and the other on convex polygons with congruent sides, with respectively positive and negative answers.</description>

      <title>Bounded ratios for Lorentzian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiplicative inequalities among entries of Lorentzian matrices, referred to as bounded ratios. These inequalities can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Alexandrov--Fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes. Our main structural result identifies the cone of all bounded ratios on Lorentzian matrices with the dual of the cut cone, a finitely generated integral polyhedral cone extensively studied in metric geometry and graph theory. We examine in detail the pentagonal ratio, which first appears for Lorentzian matrices of size at least five. For Lorentzian matrices of size three, we determine the optimal bounding constants across the entire cone of bounded ratios, obtaining an explicit entropy-like formula. We conjecture that any normalized bounded ratio is, in fact, bounded by 2.</description>
