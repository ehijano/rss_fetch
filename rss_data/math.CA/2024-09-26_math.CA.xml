      <title>Geodesic Distance Riesz Energy on Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study probability measures that minimize the Riesz energy with respect to the geodesic distance $\vartheta (x,y)$ on projective spaces $\mathbb{FP}^d$ (such energies arise from the 1959 conjecture of Fejes T\'oth about sums of non-obtuse angles), i.e. the integral \begin{equation} \frac{1}{s} \int_{\mathbb{FP}^d} \int_{\mathbb{FP}^d} \big( \vartheta (x,y) \big)^{-s} d\mu(x) d\mu (y) \,\,\, \text{ for } \,\,\, s&lt;d \end{equation}
  and find ranges of the parameter $s$ for which the energy is minimized by the uniform measure $\sigma$ on $\mathbb{FP}^d$. To this end, we use various methods of harmonic analysis, such as Ces\`aro averages of Jacobi expansions and $A_1$ inequalities, and establish a rather general theorem guaranteeing that certain energies with singular kernels are minimized by $\sigma$.
  In addition, we obtain further results and present numerical evidence, which uncover a peculiar effect that minimizers this energy undergo numerous phase transitions, in sharp contrast with many analogous known examples (even the seemingly similar geodesic Riesz energy on the sphere), which usually have only one transition (between uniform and discrete minimizers).</description>

      <title>Weighted Weak-type Inequalities For Fractionally Sparsely Dominated Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16812v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish quantitative weak type estimates for operators that are dominated by (fractional) sparse operators in bilinear sense. Specifically, we derive bounds for both the restricted weak type $L^{p,1}\rightarrow L^{q,\infty}$ and the multiplier weak type, the latter of which has been previously considered by Cruz-Uribe and Sweeting. These estimates provide a precise quantification of the mapping properties of the considered operators, extending and refining the existing theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $T$ is a compactly supported distribution on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, then the Fourier transform of $T$ is $p$-th power integrable if and only if the Weyl transform of $T$ is $p$-th power traceable, and the Fourier transform of $T$ vanishes at infinity if and only if the Weyl transform of $T$ is a compact operator.</description>

      <title>R$_{II}$ type three term relations for bivariate polynomials orthogonal with respect to varying weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bivariate weight function defined on the positive quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$, we study polynomials in two variables orthogonal with respect to varying measures obtained by special modifications of this weight function. In particular, the varying weight functions are given by the multiplication of $x_1^{-n}x_2^{-n}$ times the original weight function. Apart from the question of the existence and construction of such kind of orthogonal polynomials, we show that the systems of bivariate polynomials orthogonal with respect to this kind of varying weights satisfy R$_{II}$ type three term relations, one for every variable. A method to construct bivariate orthogonal systems with respect to varying weights based in the Koornwinder's method is developed. Finally, several examples and particular cases have been analysed.</description>

      <title>Braid monodromy for a trinomial algebraic equation by means of Mellin-Barnes integral representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a braid monodromy representation of functions satisfying an algebraic equation containing three terms (trinomial equation). We follow global analytic continuation of the roots to a trinomial algebraic equation that are expressed by Mellin-Barnes integral representations. We depict braids that arise from the monodromy around all branching points. The global braid monodromy is described in terms of rational twists of strands that yield a classical Artin braid representation of algebraic functions. As a corollary, we get a precise description of the Galois group of a trinomial algebraic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators, and in particular, their topological dynamics. We prove the dynamics of both these systems can be reduced to a flow on a solid torus, with at most a finite number of attracting periodic trajectories. As a consequence, we obtain that every periodic trajectory for the Nose-Hoover and the Moore-Spiegel Oscillators is a Torus knot.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction and the gradient flow of relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction, widely used in science, maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space. We investigate a basic mathematical model underlying the techniques of stochastic neighborhood embedding (SNE) and its popular variant t-SNE. Distances between points in high dimensions are used to define a probability distribution on pairs of points, measuring how similar the points are. The aim is to map these points to low dimensions in an optimal way so that similar points are closer together. This is carried out by minimizing the relative entropy between two probability distributions.
  We consider the gradient flow of the relative entropy and analyze its long-time behavior. This is a self-contained mathematical problem about the behavior of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We find optimal bounds for the diameter of the evolving sets as time tends to infinity. In particular, the diameter may blow up for the t-SNE version, but remains bounded for SNE.</description>

      <title>Smooth discrepancy and Littlewood's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^d$, we estimate the smooth discrepancy of the Kronecker sequence $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1)_{n\geq 1}$. We find that it can be smaller than the classical discrepancy of $\textbf{any}$ sequence when $d \le 2$, and can even be bounded in the case $d=1$. To achieve this, we establish a novel deterministic analogue of Beck's local-to-global principle (Ann. of Math. 1994), which relates the discrepancy of a Kronecker sequence to multiplicative diophantine approximation. This opens up a new avenue of attack for Littlewood's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for partially degenerate nonlocal dispersal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems, specifically focusing on the case where partial diffusion coefficients are zero, referred to as the partially degenerate case. We propose two sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the principal eigenvalue in these partially degenerate systems. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for nonlocal dispersal operators with small and large diffusion coefficients, considering both non-degenerate and partially degenerate cases. Notably, we find a threshold-type result as the diffusion coefficients tend towards infinity in the partially degenerate case. Finally, we apply these findings to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction ratio in a viral diffusion model.</description>

      <title>On the Borel summability of formal solutions of certain higher-order linear ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of $n^{\text{th}}$-order linear ordinary differential equations with a large parameter $u$. Analytic solutions of these equations can be described by (divergent) formal series in descending powers of $u$. We demonstrate that, given mild conditions on the potential functions of the equation, the formal solutions are Borel summable with respect to the parameter $u$ in large, unbounded domains of the independent variable. We establish that the formal series expansions serve as asymptotic expansions, uniform with respect to the independent variable, for the Borel re-summed exact solutions. Additionally, we show that the exact solutions can be expressed using factorial series in the parameter, and these expansions converge in half-planes, uniformly with respect to the independent variable. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to an $n^{\text{th}}$-order Airy-type equation.</description>

      <title>Basics of Multiple Polyexponential Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>
