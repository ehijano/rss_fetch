      <title>A model for the coherent walking $\omega$-equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a certain $\omega$-category, which was constructed in previous work by the third and fourth author, is a model for the fully coherent walking $\omega$-equivalence. Further, appropriate truncations of it give models for the fully coherent walking $n$-equivalence for each $n\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, I: Construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. Motivated by work of Calaque-Haugseng-Scheimbauer [CHS22], we construct a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories $\mathscr{PP}(\mathscr{C}; Q^\otimes)$ parametrized by an $\infty$-category $\mathscr{C}$ with finite limits and a representable functor $\mathscr{Q}^\otimes = \mathscr{C}(-, Q^\otimes) : \mathscr{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathrm{CAlg}(\mathscr{C}\mathrm{at}_1)$ with pushforwards. We use this general construction and derived algebraic geometry to build $\mathscr{ARW}$, an approximation to the $3$-category of Rozansky-Witten models whose existence was conjectured by Kapustin-Rozansky [KR10]. In the second part we will study the dualizable objects of $\mathscr{ARW}$ and show that our construction extends the matrix factorization $2$-category of Brunner-Carqueville-Roggenkamp [BCR23].</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>

      <title>Haag-Kastler stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible and powerful than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a successful and radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal semiinjective resolutions in the $Q$-shaped derived category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injective resolutions of modules are key objects of homological algebra, which are used for the computation of derived functors. Semiinjective resolutions of chain complexes are more general objects, which are used for the computation of $\operatorname{Hom}$ spaces in the derived category $\mathscr{D}( A )$ of a ring $A$. Minimal semiinjective resolutions have the additional property of being unique.
  The $Q$-shaped derived category $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ consists of $Q$-shaped diagrams for a suitable preadditive category $Q$, and it generalises $\mathscr{D}( A )$. Some special cases of $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ are the derived categories of differential modules, $m$-periodic chain complexes, and $N$-complexes, and there are many other possibilities. The category $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$ shares some key properties of $\mathscr{D}( A )$; for instance, it is triangulated and compactly generated.
  This paper establishes a theory of minimal semiinjective resolutions in $\mathscr{D}_Q( A )$. As a sample application, it generalises a theorem by Ringel--Zhang on differential modules.</description>

      <title>Hilbert spaces over $C^*$-tensor categories, Fredholm modules and cyclic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Fredholm modules over an algebra taking values in generalized Hilbert spaces over a rigid $C^*$-tensor category. Using methods of Connes, we obtain Chern characters taking values in cyclic cohomology. These Chern characters are well behaved with respect to the periodicity operator, and depend only on the homotopy class of the Fredholm module.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

      <title>Unitary anchored planar algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:1607.06041], we established an equivalence between pointed pivotal module tensor categories and anchored planar algebras. This article introduces the notion of unitarity for both module tensor categories and anchored planar algebras, and establishes the unitary analog of the above equivalence. Our constructions use Baez's 2-Hilbert spaces (i.e., semisimple $C^*$-categories equipped with unitary traces), the unitary Yoneda embedding, and the notion of unitary adjunction for dagger functors between 2-Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Univalent Enriched Categories and the Enriched Rezk Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.</description>

      <title>A bijection between support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs in extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and injectives. We give a new definition of tilting subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$ and prove it coincides with the definition given in [19]. As applications, we introduce the notions of support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs of $\mathscr{C}$. We build a bijection between support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and certain $\tau$-cotorsion pairs. Moreover, this bijection induces a bijection between tilting subcategories and certain cotorsion pairs.</description>
