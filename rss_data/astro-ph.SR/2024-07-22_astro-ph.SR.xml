      <title>A mm and near-IR study of YSOs: from outbursting protostars to satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are in a golden era observing Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), protoplanetary disks, and substellar objects, crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. This Ph.D. thesis explores two binary systems.
  Firstly, we study an eruptive YSO, HBC 494, using ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) observations. It's a FUor system in Orion Molecular Cloud with a resolved binary system: HBC 494 N (primary) and HBC 494 S (secondary) separated by 75 au. The disks show hints of aligned formation scenarios, with HBC 494 N being brighter and larger. Molecular line observations reveal bipolar outflows and rotating envelopes. Cavity features within the continuum disks' area suggest continuum over-subtraction or slow-moving jets and chemical destruction along the line-of-sight.
  Secondly, we examine the young binary system $\eta$ Tel using VLT/SPHERE H band imaging. It consists of an A-type star and a brown dwarf companion $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 208 au. Astrometric measurements over 19 years yield a low eccentric orbit with an inclination of 81.9 degrees. The mass of $\eta$ Tel B is determined to be 48 M$_{Jup}$, consistent with previous literature. No significant residual indicative of a satellite or disk surrounding the companion is detected, with limits ruling out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B at separations down to 33 au with masses as low as 1.6M$_{Jup}$.
  These studies employ sub-mm to near-IR observations, highlighting the complexity of (sub)stellar formation/evolution. This thesis contributes diverse analyses, providing insights into these intriguing processes.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) taken from Romagnolo et al. (2024, Paper I); by running evolution models for initial masses 60 and 200 Msun, using MESA and GENEC. For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. We set initial rotation as 40% of the critical angular velocity, overshooting =0.5, Tayler-Spruit for the angular momentum transport, and Ledoux criterion for the convective layers. Both codes predict different tracks across the HRD. For the 60 Msun case, Genec models predict a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas MESA model predicts a large radial expansion post-MS reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 Msun case, differences are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing, and only the treatment for superadiabacity creates an impact during the He-burning stage. The switch of the mass loss based on the proximity to the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface formed from initial masses $\gtrsim60$ Msun. These stars are constrained in a Teff range of the HR diagram which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_e$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades introduced in Paper I, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity VII. Stellar and wind properties of B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. B supergiants (BSGs) represent an important connection between the main sequence and more extreme evolutionary stages of massive stars. Additionally, lying toward the cool end of the hot star regime, determining their wind properties is crucial to constrain the evolution and feedback of massive stars as, for instance, they might manifest the bi-stability jump phenomenon. Aims. We undertake a detailed analysis of a representative sample of 18 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) BSGs within the ULLYSES and XShootU datasets. Our UV and optical analysis spans BSGs from B0 to B8 - covering the bi-stability jump region. We aim to evaluate their evolutionary status and verify what their wind properties say about the bi-stability jump in a low-metallicity environment. Methods. We used the CMFGEN to model the spectra and photometry (from UV to infrared) of our sample. We compare our results with different evolutionary models, with previous determinations in the literature of OB stars, and with diverging mass-loss recipes at the bi-stability jump. Additionally, we provide the first BSG models in the SMC including X-rays. Results. (i) Within a single-stellar evolution framework, the evolutionary status of early BSGs seem less clear than that of late BSGs, which agree with H-shell burning models. (ii) UV analysis shows evidence that BSGs contain X-rays in their atmospheres, for which we provide constraints. In general, we find higher X-ray luminosity (close to the standard log(L_X/L) ~ -7) for early BSGs. For cooler BSGs, lower values are preferred, log(L_X/L) ~ -8.5. (iii) The obtained mass-loss rates suggest neither a jump nor a monotonic decrease with temperature. Instead, a rather constant trend is observed, which is at odds with the increase found for Galactic BSGs. (iv) The wind velocity behavior with temperature shows a sharp drop at ~19 kK, similar to what is observed for Galactic BSGs.</description>

      <title>The chemistry of star and planet formation with SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we aim to summarise the efforts of the Italian SKA scientific community in conducting surveys of star-forming regions within our Galaxy, in the development of astrochemical research on protostellar envelopes and disks, and in studying the planet formation process itself. The objective is dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust throughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine protoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules, such as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit significantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Short-period Heartbeat Binaries from TESS Full-Frame Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify $240$ short-period ($P \lesssim 10$ days) binary systems in the TESS data, $180$ of which are heartbeat binaries (HB). The sample is mostly a mix of A and B-type stars and primarily includes eclipsing systems, where over $30\%$ of the sources with primary and secondary eclipses show a secular change in their inter-eclipse timings and relative eclipse depths over a multi-year timescale, likely due to orbital precession. The orbital parameters of the population are estimated by fitting a heartbeat model to their phase curves and Gaia magnitudes, where the model accounts for ellipsoidal variability, Doppler beaming, reflection effects, and eclipses. We construct the sample's period-eccentricity distribution and find an eccentricity cutoff (where $e \rightarrow 0$) at a period $1.7$ days. Additionally, we measure the periastron advance rate for the $12$ of the precessing sources and find that they all exhibit prograde apsidal precession, which is as high as $9^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$ for one of the systems. Using the inferred stellar parameters, we estimate the general relativistic precession rate of the argument of periastron for the population and expect over $30$ systems to show a precession in excess of $0.3^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$</description>

      <title>The First Evidence of a Host Star Metallicity Cut-off In The Formation of Super-Earth Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation is expected to be severely limited in disks of low metallicity, owing to both the small solid mass reservoir and the low opacity accelerating the disk gas dissipation. While previous studies have found a weak correlation between the occurrence rates of small planets ($\leq$4R$_\oplus$) and stellar metallicity, so far no studies have probed below the metallicity limit beyond which planet formation is predicted to be suppressed. Here, we constructed a large catalog of ~110,000 metal-poor stars observed by the TESS mission with spectroscopically-derived metallicities, and systematically probed planet formation within the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) for the first time. Extrapolating known higher-metallicity trends for small, short-period planets predicts the discovery of ~68 superEarths around these stars (~85,000 stars) after accounting for survey completeness; however, we detect none. As a result, we have placed the most stringent upper limit on super-Earth occurrence rates around metal-poor stars (-0.75 &lt; [Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.5) to date, $\leq$ 1.67%, a statistically significant (p-value=0.000685) deviation from the prediction of metallicity trends derived with Kepler and K2. We find a clear host star metallicity cliff for super-Earths that could indicate the threshold below which planets are unable to grow beyond an Earth-mass at short orbital periods. This finding provides a crucial input to planet formation theories, and has implications for the small planet inventory of the Galaxy and the galactic epoch at which the formation of small planets started.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope (CE) evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption is $\sim$$0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WD.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Hydrocarbons detected by JWST/MIRI in the inner disk of Sz28 consistent with a high C/O gas-phase chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of JWST, we acquire unprecedented insights into the physical and chemical structure of the inner regions of planet-forming disks where terrestrial planet formation occurs. The very low-mass stars (VLMS) are known to have a high occurrence rate of the terrestrial planets around them. Exploring the chemical composition of the gas in these inner regions of the disks can aid a better understanding of the connection between planet-forming disks and planets. The MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) project is a large JWST Guaranteed Time program to characterize the chemistry and physical state of planet-forming and debris disks. We use the JWST-MIRI/MRS spectrum to investigate the gas and dust composition of the planet-forming disk around the very low-mass star Sz28 (M5.5, 0.12\,M$_{\odot}$). We use the dust-fitting tool (DuCK) to determine the dust continuum and to get constraints on the dust composition and grain sizes. We use 0D slab models to identify and fit the molecular spectral features, yielding estimates on the temperature, column density and the emitting area. To test our understanding of the chemistry in the disks around VLMS, we employ the thermo-chemical disk model {P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O}} and investigate the reservoirs of the detected hydrocarbons. We explore how the C/O ratio affects the inner disk chemistry. JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including \ce{CH3}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{C2H2}, \ce{^{13}CCH2}, \ce{C2H6}, \ce{C3H4}, \ce{C4H2} and \ce{C6H6} suggesting a disk with a gaseous C/O\,&gt;\,1. Additionally, we detect \ce{CO2}, \ce{^{13}CO2}, \ce{HCN}, and \ce{HC3N}. \ce{H2O} and OH are absent in the spectrum. We do not detect PAHs. Photospheric stellar absorption lines of \ce{H2O} and \ce{CO} are identified. Notably, our radiation thermo-chemical disk models are able to produce these detected hydrocarbons in the surface layers of the disk when the ...</description>

      <title>Stellar substructures in the Galactic disc and halo: Properties, origins and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial, kinematic and orbital properties, along with ages and chemical compositions of the thin disc, thick disc and various stellar substructures present in the halo, are studied based on data from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys. The star formation in the Galactic thin and thick disc, with peak metallicities of $-0.20$ and $-0.45$ dex, is found to have peaked about 5.5 and 12.5 Gyr ago, respectively. The thin disc is also found to have experienced an initial star formation burst about 12.5 Gyr ago. The pro-grade population Splash and hot-disc (HD), with peak metallicity of about $-0.60$ and $-0.43$, are found to be about 13.03 and 12.21 Gyr old, respectively, with peak eccentricity of 0.70 and 0.35, are understood to be of in situ origin. The Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S), Thamnos and Sequoia, with peak metallicity of about $-1.31$, $-1.36$ and $-1.56$, are found to be about 11.66, 12.89 and 12.18 Gyr, respectively, and are understood to be remnants of dwarf galaxies merged with the Milky Way. The HD, Splash, and Thamnos are found to have experienced chemical evolution similar to the thick disc while GE/S, Sequoia, and Helmi stream are found to have experienced distinct chemical enrichment of iron and $\alpha$-elements.</description>

      <title>Precise Bolometric Luminosities and Effective Temperatures of 23 late-T and Y dwarfs Obtained with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present infrared spectral energy distributions of 23 late-type T and Y dwarfs obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. The spectral energy distributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI LRS spectra covering the $\sim$1--12 $\mu$m wavelength range at $\lambda/ \Delta \lambda \approx 100$ and broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 $\mu$m. The spectra exhibit absorption features common to these objects including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes relatively smoothly with spectral type at $\lambda &lt; 3$ $\mu$m and $\lambda &gt; 8$ $\mu$m, it shows no clear trend in the 5 $\mu$m region where a large fraction of the flux emerges. The broad wavelength coverage of the data enables us to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool brown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer and HST, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these cool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar metallicity evolutionary models to estimate the radii of the dwarfs which results in effective temperature estimates ranging from $\sim$1000 to 350 K with a median uncertainty of $\pm$20 K which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over previous work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or do not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.</description>

      <title>{\gamma}-Ray and ultra-high energy neutrino background suppression due to solar radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun emits copious amounts of photons and neutrinos in an approximately spatially isotropic distribution. Diffuse $\gamma$-rays and ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos from extragalactic sources may subsequently interact and annihilate with the emitted solar photons and neutrinos respectively. This will in turn induce an anisotropy in the cosmic ray (CR) background due to attenuation of the $\gamma$-ray and UHE neutrino flux by the solar radiation. Measuring this reduction, therefore, presents a simple and powerful astrophysical probe of electroweak interactions. In this letter we compute such anisotropies for TeV $\gamma$-rays, which at the Earth (Sun) can be at least $\simeq 10^{-4},(10^{-2})$. The optical depth at Earth for elongation angles more focused around the Sun ($\lesssim 10^\circ$), can be around $10^{-3}$ and larger. Neutrino attenuation is extremely tiny for for PeV scale UHE neutrinos. We briefly discuss observational prospects for experiments such as the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT), High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector, The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and IceCube. The potential for measuring $\gamma$-ray attenuation at orbital locations of other active satellites such as the Parker Solar Probe and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is also explored.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the MRI driven dynamo in a stratified shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven dynamo in a geometrically thin disc ($H/R\ll 1$) using stratified zero net flux (ZNF) shearing box simulations. We find that mean fields and EMFs oscillate with a primary frequency $f_{\rm dyn} = 0.017$ ($\approx 9$ orbital period), but also have higher harmonics at $3f_{\rm dyn}$. Correspondingly, the current helicity, has two frequencies $2f_{\rm dyn}$ and $4f_{\rm dyn}$ respectively, which appear to be the beat frequencies of mean fields and EMFs as expected from the magnetic helicity density evolution equation. Further, we adopt a novel inversion algorithm called the `Iterative Removal Of Sources' (IROS), to extract the turbulent dynamo coefficients in the mean-field closure using the mean magnetic fields and EMFs obtained from the shearing box simulation. We show that an $\alpha-$effect ($\alpha_{yy}$) is predominantly responsible for the creation of the poloidal field from the toroidal field, while shear generates back a toroidal field from the poloidal field; indicating that an $\alpha-\Omega$-type dynamo is operative in MRI-driven accretion discs. We also find that both strong outflow ($\bar{v}_z$) and turbulent pumping ($\gamma_z$ ) transport mean fields away from the mid-plane. Instead of turbulent diffusivity, they are the principal sink terms in the mean magnetic energy evolution equation. We find encouraging evidence that a generative helicity flux is responsible for the effective $\alpha$-effect. Finally, we point out potential limitations of horizontal ($x-y$) averaging in defining the `mean' on the extraction of dynamo coefficients and their physical interpretations.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTAO, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTAO may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spectroscopy for Precessing Binary Black Hole Coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>
