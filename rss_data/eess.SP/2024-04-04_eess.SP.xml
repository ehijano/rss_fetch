      <title>A Hybrid BLE/UWB Localization Technique with Automatic Radio Map Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization systems intended for home use by people with mild cognitive impairment should comply with specific requirements. They should provide the users with sub-meter accuracy allowing for analyzing patient's movement trajectory and be energy effective, so the devices do not need frequent charging. Such requirements could be satisfied by employing a hybrid positioning system combining accurate UWB with energy efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. In the paper, such a solution is presented and experimentally verified. In the proposed system, user's location is derived using BLE based fingerprinting. A radio map utilized by the algorithm is created automatically during system operation with the support of UWB subsystem. Such an approach allows the users to repeat system calibration as often as possible, which raises systems resistance to environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters Performance in a Hybrid BLE-UWB Localization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a comparison of performance of two Kalman Filters: extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in a hybrid Bluetooth-Low-Energy-ultra-wideband (BLE-UWB) based localization system. In the system, the user is localized primarily based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements of BLE signals. The UWB part of the system is periodically used to improve localization accuracy by supplying the algorithm with measured UWB packets time difference of arrival (TDOA). The proposed scheme was experimentally validated using two algorithms: the EKF and the UKF. The localization accuracy of both algorithms is compared.</description>

      <title>Age-of-Information-Aware Distributed Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has attracted substantial interests in age-of-information (AoI)-aware task offloading of mobile edge computing (MEC)-namely, minimizing service latency. Additionally, the use of MEC systems poses an additional problem arising from limited battery resources of MDs. This paper tackles the pressing challenge of AoI-aware distributed task offloading optimization, where user association (UA), resource allocation (RA), full-task offloading, and battery of mobile devices (MDs) are jointly considered. In existing studies, joint optimization of overall task offloading and UA is seldom considered due to the complexity of combinatorial optimization problems, and in cases where it is considered, linear objective functions such as power consumption are adopted. Revolutionizing the realm of MEC, our objective includes all major components contributing to users' quality of experience, including AoI and energy consumption. To achieve this, we first formulate an NP-hard combinatorial problem, where the objective function comprises three elements: communication latency, computation latency, and battery usage. We derive a closed-form RA solution of the problem; next, we provide a distributed pricing-based UA solution. We simulate the proposed algorithm for various vision and language AI tasks. Our numerical results show that the proposed method Pareto-dominates baseline methods. More specifically, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform baseline methods by 1.62 times smaller AoI with 41.2% less energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined using second-order spatio-spectral differences, is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the underlying spatio-spectral properties. However, since SSTV refers only to adjacent pixels/bands, semi-local spatial structures are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly design S3TTV, defined by the sum of the nuclear norms of matrices consisting of second-order spatio-spectral differences in small spectral blocks (we call these matrices as spatio-spectral structure tensors). The proposed regularization method simultaneously models the spatial piecewise-smoothness, the spatial similarity between adjacent bands, and the spectral correlation across all bands in small spectral blocks, leading to effective noise removal while preserving the semi-local spatial structures. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Covariance Fitting for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance fitting (CF) is a comprehensive approach for direction of arrival (DoA) estimation, consolidating many common solutions. Standard practice is to use Euclidean criteria for CF, disregarding the intrinsic Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) geometry of the spatial covariance matrices. We assert that this oversight leads to inherent limitations. In this paper, as a remedy, we present a comprehensive study of the use of various Riemannian metrics of HPD matrices in CF. We focus on the advantages of the Affine-Invariant (AI) and the Log-Euclidean (LE) Riemannian metrics. Consequently, we propose a new practical beamformer based on the LE metric and derive analytically its spatial characteristics, such as the beamwidth and sidelobe attenuation, under noisy conditions. Comparing these features to classical beamformers shows significant advantage. In addition, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the LE beamformer's robustness in scenarios with small sample sizes and in the presence of noise, interference, and multipath channels.</description>

      <title>Comparative Efficacy of Commercial Wearables for Circadian Rhythm Home Monitoring from Activity, Heart Rate, and Core Body Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circadian rhythms govern biological patterns that follow a 24-hour cycle. Dysfunctions in circadian rhythms can contribute to various health problems, such as sleep disorders. Current circadian rhythm assessment methods, often invasive or subjective, limit circadian rhythm monitoring to laboratories. Hence, this study aims to investigate scalable consumer-centric wearables for circadian rhythm monitoring outside traditional laboratories. In a two-week longitudinal study conducted in real-world settings, 36 participants wore an Actigraph, a smartwatch, and a core body temperature sensor to collect activity, temperature, and heart rate data. We evaluated circadian rhythms calculated from commercial wearables by comparing them with circadian rhythm reference measures, i.e., Actigraph activities and chronotype questionnaire scores. The circadian rhythm metric acrophases, determined from commercial wearables using activity, heart rate, and temperature data, significantly correlated with the acrophase derived from Actigraph activities (r=0.96, r=0.87, r=0.79; all p&lt;0.001) and chronotype questionnaire (r=-0.66, r=-0.73, r=-0.61; all p&lt;0.001). The acrophases obtained concurrently from consumer sensors significantly predicted the chronotype (R2=0.64; p&lt;0.001). Our study validates commercial sensors for circadian rhythm assessment, highlighting their potential to support maintaining healthy rhythms and provide scalable and timely health monitoring in real-life scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital transformation is fundamentally changing our industries, affecting planning, execution as well as monitoring of production processes in a wide range of application fields. With product line-ups becoming more and more versatile and diverse, the necessary inspection and monitoring sparks significant novel requirements on the corresponding Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) systems. The establishment of increasingly powerful approaches to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) may provide just the needed innovation to solve some of these challenges.
  In this paper we provide a comprehensive survey about the usage of AI methods in NDE in light of the recent innovations towards NDE 4.0. Since we cannot discuss each NDE modality in one paper, we limit our attention to magnetic methods, ultrasound, thermography, as well as optical inspection. In addition to reviewing recent AI developments in each field, we draw common connections by pointing out NDE-related tasks that have a common underlying mathematical problem and categorizing the state of the art according to the corresponding sub-tasks. In so doing, interdisciplinary connections are drawn that provide a more complete overall picture.</description>

      <title>Alzheimer's disease detection in PSG signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sleep disorders exhibit a close association, where disruptions in sleep patterns often precede the onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. This study delves into the potential of utilizing sleep-related electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired through polysomnography (PSG) for the early detection of AD. Our primary focus is on exploring semi-supervised Deep Learning techniques for the classification of EEG signals due to the clinical scenario characterized by the limited data availability. The methodology entails testing and comparing the performance of semi-supervised SMATE and TapNet models, benchmarked against the supervised XCM model, and unsupervised Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The study highlights the significance of spatial and temporal analysis capabilities, conducting independent analyses of each sleep stage. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SMATE in leveraging limited labeled data, achieving stable metrics across all sleep stages, and reaching 90% accuracy in its supervised form. Comparative analyses reveal SMATE's superior performance over TapNet and HMM, while XCM excels in supervised scenarios with an accuracy range of 92 - 94%. These findings underscore the potential of semi-supervised models in early AD detection, particularly in overcoming the challenges associated with the scarcity of labeled data. Ablation tests affirm the critical role of spatio-temporal feature extraction in semi-supervised predictive performance, and t-SNE visualizations validate the model's proficiency in distinguishing AD patterns. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of AD detection through innovative Deep Learning approaches, highlighting the crucial role of semi-supervised learning in addressing data limitations.</description>

      <title>Multiple UAV-Assisted Cooperative DF Relaying in Multi-User Massive MIMO IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers a multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MU-mMIMO) Internet-of-Things (IoT) system, where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating as decode-and-forward (DF) relays connect the base station (BS) to a large number of IoT devices. To maximize the total achievable rate, we propose a novel joint optimization problem of hybrid beamforming (HBF), multiple UAV relay positioning, and power allocation (PA) to multiple IoT users. The study adopts a geometry-based millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel model for both links and utilizes sequential optimization based on K-means UAV-user association. The radio frequency (RF) stages are designed based on the slow time-varying angular information, while the baseband (BB) stages are designed utilizing the reduced-dimension effective channel matrices. The illustrative results show that multiple UAV-assisted cooperative relaying systems outperform a single UAV system in practical user distributions. Moreover, compared to fixed positions and equal PA of UAVs and BS, the joint optimization of UAV location and PA substantially enhances the total achievable rate.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>Full-Scale Readout Electronics for the ECHo-100k Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the development of cryogenic particle detectors such as magnetic microcalorimeters (MMCs) allow the fabrication of sensor arrays with an increasing number of pixels. Since these detectors must be operated at the lowest temperatures, the readout of large detector arrays is still quite challenging. This is especially true for the ECHo experiment, which presently aims to simultaneously run 6,000 two-pixel detectors to investigate the electron neutrino mass. For this reason, we developed a readout system based on a microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) that is operated by a custom software-defined radio (SDR) at room-temperature. The SDR readout electronics consist of three distinct hardware units: a data processing board with a Xilinx ZynqUS+ MPSoC; a converter board that features DACs, ADCs, and a coherent clock distribution network; and a radio frequency front-end board to translate the signals between the baseband and the microwave domains. Here, we describe the characteristics of the full-scale SDR system. First, the generated frequency comb for driving the $\mu$MUX was evaluated. Subsequently, by operating the SDR in direct loopback, the crosstalk of the individual channels after frequency demultiplexing was investigated. Finally, the system was used with a 16-channel $\mu$MUX to evaluate the linearity of the SDR, and the noise contributed to the overall readout setup.</description>

      <title>MMSE Channel Estimation in Large-Scale MIMO: Improved Robustness with Reduced Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale MIMO systems with a massive number N of individually controlled antennas pose significant challenges for minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, based on uplink pilots. The major ones arise from the computational complexity, which scales with $N^3$, and from the need for accurate knowledge of the channel statistics. This paper aims to address both challenges by introducing reduced-complexity channel estimation methods that achieve the performance of MMSE in terms of estimation accuracy and uplink spectral efficiency while demonstrating improved robustness in practical scenarios where channel statistics must be estimated. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent structure of the spatial correlation matrix induced by the array geometry. Specifically, we use a Kronecker decomposition for uniform planar arrays and a well-suited circulant approximation for uniform linear arrays. By doing so, a significantly lower computational complexity is achieved, scaling as $N\sqrt{N}$ and $N\log N$ for squared planar arrays and linear arrays, respectively.</description>

      <title>Combined DL-UL Distributed Beamforming Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output system with multi-antenna access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs), where the UEs can be served in both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) within a resource block. We tackle the combined optimization of the DL precoders and combiners at the APs and DL UEs, respectively, together with the UL combiners and precoders at the APs and UL UEs, respectively. To this end, we propose distributed beamforming designs enabled by iterative bi-directional training (IBT) and based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. To reduce the IBT overhead and thus enhance the effective DL and UL rates, we carry out the distributed beamforming design by assuming that all the UEs are served solely in the DL and then utilize the obtained beamformers for the DL and UL data transmissions after proper scaling. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed combined DL-UL distributed beamforming design over separate DL and UL designs, especially with short resource blocks.</description>

Abstract: In modern manufacturing, most of the product lines are conforming. Few products are nonconforming but with different defect types. The identification of defect types can help further root cause diagnosis of production lines. With the sensing development, continuous signals of process variables can be collected in high resolution, which can be regarded as multichannel functional data. They have abundant information to characterize the process and help identify the defect types. Motivated by a real example from the pipe tightening process, we target at detect classification when each sample is a multichannel functional data. However, the available samples for each defect type are limited and imbalanced. Moreover, the functions are partially observed since the pre-tightening process before the pipe tightening process is unobserved. To classify the defect samples based on imbalanced, multichannel, and partially observed functional data is very important but challenging. Thus, we propose an innovative framework known as "Multichannel Partially Observed Functional Modeling for Defect Classification with an Imbalanced Dataset" (MPOFI). The framework leverages the power of deep metric learning in conjunction with a neural network specially crafted for processing functional data. This paper introduces a neural network explicitly tailored for handling multichannel and partially observed functional data, complemented by developing a corresponding loss function for training on imbalanced datasets. The results from a real-world case study demonstrate the superior accuracy of our framework when compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Electric and Hydraulic Data Fusion to Enhance Short-term Forecasting of Pumped-storage Hydroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pumped-storage hydropower plants (PSH) actively participate in grid power-frequency control and therefore often operate under dynamic conditions, which results in rapidly varying system states. Predicting these dynamically changing states is essential for comprehending the underlying sensor and machine conditions. This understanding aids in detecting anomalies and faults, ensuring the reliable operation of the connected power grid, and in identifying faulty and miscalibrated sensors. PSH are complex, highly interconnected systems encompassing electrical and hydraulic subsystems, each characterized by their respective underlying networks that can individually be represented as graphs. To take advantage of this relational inductive bias, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been separately applied to state forecasting tasks in the individual subsystems, but without considering their interdependencies. In PSH, however, these subsystems depend on the same control input, making their operations highly interdependent and interconnected. Consequently, hydraulic and electrical sensor data should be fused across PSH subsystems to improve state forecasting accuracy. This approach has not been explored in GNN literature yet because many available PSH graphs are limited to their respective subsystem boundaries, which makes the method unsuitable to be applied directly. In this work, we introduce the application of spectral-temporal graph neural networks, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to concurrently capture and learn meaningful subsystem interdependencies and the dynamic patterns observed in electric and hydraulic sensors. Our method effectively fuses data from the PSH's subsystems by operating on a unified, system-wide graph, learned directly from the data, This approach leads to demonstrably improved state forecasting performance and enhanced generalizability.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Cooperative Sensing With Limited Backhaul Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cooperative sensing framework designed for integrated sensing and communication cellular networks. The framework comprises one base station (BS) functioning as the sensing transmitter, while several nearby BSs act as sensing receivers. The primary objective is to facilitate cooperative target localization by enabling each receiver to share specific information with a fusion center (FC) over a limited capacity backhaul link. To achieve this goal, we propose an advanced cooperative sensing design that enhances the communication process between the receivers and the FC. Each receiver independently estimates the time delay and the reflecting coefficient associated with the reflected path from the target. Subsequently, each receiver transmits the estimated values and the received signal samples centered around the estimated time delay to the FC. To efficiently quantize the signal samples, a Karhunen-Lo\`eve Transform coding scheme is employed. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated to allocate backhaul resources for quantizing different samples, improving target localization. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed advanced design and demonstrate its superiority over a baseline design, where only the locally estimated values are transmitted from each receiver to the FC.</description>

      <title>Class-E, Active Electrically-Small Antenna for High-Power Wideband Transmission at the High-Frequency (HF) Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antennas operating at the high-frequency (HF) band (3-30 MHz) are frequently electrically small due to the large wavelength of electromagnetic waves (10-100 m). However, the bandwidth-efficiency products of passively matched electrically small antennas (ESAs) are fundamentally limited. Wideband HF waveforms using bandwidths of 24 kHz or more have recently received significant attention in military communications applications. Efficiently radiating such signals from conventional passive ESAs is very challenging due to fundamental physical limits on bandwidth-efficiency products of ESAs. However, active antennas are not subject to the same constraints. In this work, we present the design and experimental characterization of a high-power, active ESA with enhanced bandwidth-efficiency product compared to {that of} passively matched ESAs. Specifically, the proposed active ESA can radiate wideband HF signals with banwidths of 24 kHz or more, with total efficiencies up to 80$\%$, and radiated power levels approaching 100 W. Our approach uses a highly-efficient, integrated class-E switching circuit specifically designed to drive an electrically small, high-Q HF antenna over a bandwidth exceeding 24 kHz. Using a high-Q RLC antenna model, we have successfully demonstrated wideband binary ASK, PSK, and FSK modulations with the proposed class-E switching architecture. Experimental results indicate that the bandwidth-efficiency product of this class-E active antenna is 5.4-9.8 dB higher than that of an equivalent passive design with the same data rate, and bit-error-rate (BER).</description>

      <title>Towards Transcranial 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy of the Nonhuman Primate Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hemodynamic changes occur in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Developing imaging techniques allowing the in vivo visualization and quantification of cerebral blood flow would help better understand the underlying mechanism of those cerebrovascular diseases. 3D ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a novel technology that can map the microvasculature of the brain at large depth and has been mainly used until now in rodents. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of 3D ULM of the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain with a single 256-channels programmable ultrasound scanner. We achieved a highly resolved vascular map of the macaque brain at large depth in presence of craniotomy and durectomy using an 8-MHz multiplexed matrix probe. We were able to distinguish vessels as small as 26.9 {\mu}m. We also demonstrated that transcranial imaging of the macaque brain at similar depth was feasible using a 3-MHz probe and achieved a resolution of 60.4 {\mu}m. This work paves the way to clinical application of 3D ULM.</description>

      <title>DiffDet4SAR: Diffusion-based Aircraft Target Detection Network for SAR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aircraft target detection in SAR images is a challenging task due to the discrete scattering points and severe background clutter interference. Currently, methods with convolution-based or transformer-based paradigms cannot adequately address these issues. In this letter, we explore diffusion models for SAR image aircraft target detection for the first time and propose a novel \underline{Diff}usion-based aircraft target \underline{Det}ection network \underline{for} \underline{SAR} images (DiffDet4SAR). Specifically, the proposed DiffDet4SAR yields two main advantages for SAR aircraft target detection: 1) DiffDet4SAR maps the SAR aircraft target detection task to a denoising diffusion process of bounding boxes without heuristic anchor size selection, effectively enabling large variations in aircraft sizes to be accommodated; and 2) the dedicatedly designed Scattering Feature Enhancement (SFE) module further reduces the clutter intensity and enhances the target saliency during inference. Extensive experimental results on the SAR-AIRcraft-1.0 dataset show that the proposed DiffDet4SAR achieves 88.4\% mAP$_{50}$, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 6\%. Code is availabel at \href{https://github.com/JoyeZLearning/DiffDet4SAR}.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Evaluation of SiPM-Based Photon Counting Receiver for IoT Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13208v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are photon-counting detectors with great potential to improve the sensitivity of optical receivers. Recent studies of SiPMs in communication focus on the speed rather than the power consumption of the receiver. The gain bandwidth product (GBP) of the amplifiers in these post-SiPM readout circuits is significantly higher than the target data rate. Additionally, the SiPM experiments for optical communication are performed using an offline method which uses instruments including oscilloscopes and personal computers to process chunks of the transmitted data. In this work, we have developed an embedded real-time field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based system to evaluate a commercially available 1 mm-sq SiPM. The implemented real-time system achieves data rates from 10 kbps to 1 Mbps with a bit error rate (BER) below 1E-3 approaching the Poisson limit. Results showed that reducing either the dark count rate or increasing the data rate leads to lower dark counts per bit time, hence less power penalty to maintain a probability of error (PE) of 1E-3. The numerically simulated results indicated that to maintain the Poisson limit, the minimum GBP of the amplifier in the post-SiPM readout circuit is 120 MHz based on the proposed setup within the tested data rates. This GBP limitation is determined by the noise floor of the read-out circuit. The analysis of the minimum GBP and electrical power consumption of the receiver in photon counting and BER enables the potential future adoption of this receiver technology when high optical sensitivity is required, such as visible light communications (VLC) for low data rate Internet of Things (IoT) applications.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-inverse reconstruction of bandlimited signals from nonuniform generalized samples with orthogonal kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to the traditional pursuit of research on nonuniform sampling of bandlimited signals, the objective of the present paper is not to find sampling conditions that permit perfect reconstruction, but to perform the best possible signal recovery from any given set of nonuniform samples, whether it is finite as in practice, or infinite to achieve the possibility of unique reconstruction in $L^2({\mathbb R})$. This leads us to consider the pseudo-inverse of the whole sampling map as a linear operator of Hilbert spaces. We propose in this paper an iterative algorithm that systematically performs this pseudo-inversion under the following conditions: (i) the input lies in some closed space $\mathscr A$ (such as a space of bandlimited functions); (ii) the samples are formed by inner product of the input with given kernel functions; (iii) these functions are orthogonal at least in a Hilbert space $\mathscr H$ that contains $\mathscr A$. This situation turns out to appear in certain time encoders that are part of the increasingly important area of event-based sampling. As a result of pseudo-inversion, we systematically achieve perfect reconstruction whenever the samples uniquely characterize the input, we obtain minimal-norm estimates when the sampling is insufficient, and the reconstruction errors are controlled in the case of noisy sampling. The algorithm consists in alternating two projections according to the general method of projections onto convex sets (POCS) and can be implemented by iterating time-varying discrete-time filtering. We finally show that our signal and sampling assumptions appear in a nontrivial manner in other existing problems of data acquisition. This includes multi-channel time encoding where $\mathscr H$ is of the type $L^2({\mathbb R})^M$, and traditional point sampling with the adoption of a Sobolev space $\mathscr H$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security in Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems with Hybrid Beamforming Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate enhancing the physical layer security (PLS) for the dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, where the base station (BS) achieves downlink communication and radar target detection simultaneously. We consider an eavesdropper intercepting the information transmitted from the BS to the downlink communication users with imperfectly known channel state information. Additionally, the location of the radar target is also imperfectly known by the BS. To enhance PLS in the considered DFRC system, we propose a novel HBF architecture, which introduces a new integrated sensing and security (I2S) symbol. The secure HBF design problem for DFRC is formulated by maximizing the minimum legitimate user communication rate subject to radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, eavesdropping rate, hardware and power constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based method to jointly optimize transmit and receive beamformers. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the superiority of the proposed I2S-aided HBF architecture for achieving DFRC and enhancing PLS.</description>

      <title>Set-Type Belief Propagation with Applications to Poisson Multi-Bernoulli SLAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) is a useful probabilistic inference algorithm for efficiently computing approximate marginal probability densities of random variables. However, in its standard form, BP is only applicable to the vector-type random variables with a fixed and known number of vector elements, while certain applications rely on RFSs with an unknown number of vector elements. In this paper, we develop BP rules for factor graphs defined on sequences of RFSs where each RFS has an unknown number of elements, with the intention of deriving novel inference methods for RFSs. Furthermore, we show that vector-type BP is a special case of set-type BP, where each RFS follows the Bernoulli process. To demonstrate the validity of developed set-type BP, we apply it to the PMB filter for SLAM, which naturally leads to new set-type BP-mapping, SLAM, multi-target tracking, and simultaneous localization and tracking filters. Finally, we explore the relationships between the vector-type BP and the proposed set-type BP PMB-SLAM implementations and show a performance gain of the proposed set-type BP PMB-SLAM filter in comparison with the vector-type BP-SLAM filter.</description>

      <title>Decoding Natural Images from EEG for Object Recognition</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, known for convenient non-invasive acquisition but low signal-to-noise ratio, have recently gained substantial attention due to the potential to decode natural images. This paper presents a self-supervised framework to demonstrate the feasibility of learning image representations from EEG signals, particularly for object recognition. The framework utilizes image and EEG encoders to extract features from paired image stimuli and EEG responses. Contrastive learning aligns these two modalities by constraining their similarity. With the framework, we attain significantly above-chance results on a comprehensive EEG-image dataset, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 15.6% and a top-5 accuracy of 42.8% in challenging 200-way zero-shot tasks. Moreover, we perform extensive experiments to explore the biological plausibility by resolving the temporal, spatial, spectral, and semantic aspects of EEG signals. Besides, we introduce attention modules to capture spatial correlations, providing implicit evidence of the brain activity perceived from EEG data. These findings yield valuable insights for neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces in real-world scenarios. The code will be released on https://github.com/eeyhsong/NICE-EEG.</description>

      <title>Visual Decoding and Reconstruction via EEG Embeddings with Guided Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. The code of ATM is available at https://github.com/dongyangli-del/EEG_Image_decode.</description>

This paper presents a hybrid unsupervised learning strategy (HULS) for monitoring complex industrial processes. Addressing the limitations of traditional Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), especially in scenarios with unbalanced data sets and highly correlated process variables, HULS combines existing unsupervised learning techniques to address these challenges. To evaluate the performance of the HULS concept, comparative experiments are performed based on a laboratory batch</description>
