      <title>Turbulence in Magnetised Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field configuration in the interior of neutron stars and its stability are open problems and may be impacted by the influence of a turbulent cascade within the star. Assessing the impact of turbulent flow with numerical simulations requires incredibly high resolution as well as long lived simulations covering multiple Alfven times. We present a series of simulations of magnetised neutron stars with resolution up to 29m and lasting at their longest 1.2s to assess this issue, the longest lasting and highest resolution such simulations to date. At the highest resolution we find evidence for a turbulent cascade absent in an unmagnetised star which cannot be captured with lower resolution simulations, consistent with Kolmogorov power law scaling. The presence of turbulence triggers an inverse cascade of helicity, while at late times the net helicity appears to vanish, suggesting that a twisted-torus is not formed in the magnetic field. We find that the presence of the magnetic field excites a characteristic quadrupolar oscillation of the density profile at 145 Hz, consistent with Alfvenic modes proposed as the source of quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetars.</description>

      <title>An environmental analysis of supernova iPTF13bvn with HST and MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.</description>

      <title>The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission -- eXTP for launch in 2030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the current status of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, which has been fully approved for launch in 2030. eXTP is a space science mission designed to study fundamental physics under extreme conditions of matter density, gravity, and magnetism. The mission aims at determining the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, measuring effects of QED, and understanding the dynamics of matter in strong-field gravity. In addition to investigating fundamental physics, the eXTP mission is poised to become a leading observatory for time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy in the 2030s, as well as providing observations of unprecedented quality on a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects. After briefly introducing the history and a summary of the scientific objectives of the eXTP mission, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of: 1) the cutting-edge technology, technical specifications, and anticipated performance of the mission's scientific instruments; 2) the full mission profile, encompassing spacecraft design, operational capabilities, and ground segment infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Dense Matter in Neutron Stars with eXTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the novel capabilities of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to study the strong gravity region around stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. eXTP can combine X-ray spectral, timing, and polarimetric techniques to study the accretion process near black holes, measure black hole masses and spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. We show how eXTP can improve the current measurements of black holes of existing X-ray missions and we discuss the scientific questions that can be addressed.</description>

      <title>Measuring monster MBHs: maybe mighty, maybe merely massive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult yet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate between competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of massive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However, these estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are calibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe. To assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant universe, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and a sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first verify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly accreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE method and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a broad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The only discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed (underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington limit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on the claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our study also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently underestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of the order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we demonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially misleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong positive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric correction vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength, at odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.</description>

      <title>Photospheric emission from GRB 211211A altered by a strong radiation-mediated shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra are typically non-thermal, with many including two spectral breaks suggestive of optically-thin emission. However, the emitted spectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features. Here, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation (KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well, significantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied time bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific momentum, $\gamma_u \beta_u \sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth ($\tau \sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\theta_u = k_{\rm B} T_u / m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks can also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in such cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to determine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.</description>

      <title>The Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: Investigating Connections to the Optical Tidal Disruption Event Population and Spectral Subclasses Through Late-Time Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT2022cmc is the first on-axis jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) to be discovered at optical wavelengths. The optically bright nature of AT2022cmc presents an unprecedented opportunity to place this jetted TDE in the context of the larger optically selected thermal TDE population and explore potential connections to optical TDE subclasses, particularly the class of luminous TDEs that lack optical spectral features. In this work we present late-time optical observations of AT2022cmc, both imaging and spectroscopy, that extend the optical dataset to $\sim 160$ days from the first detection in the observed frame. The light curve clearly evolves from red to blue, which we interpret as a transition from a non-thermally dominated spectral energy distribution (SED) to thermally dominated SED. By accounting for the non-thermal emission evident in the optical SED at early times, we extract the properties of the thermal emission and compare to a sample of optically selected thermal TDEs. We find that the properties of AT2022cmc are consistent with previous correlations found for the evolution and properties of thermal TDEs, with the thermal properties of AT2022cmc aligning with the class of featureless and luminous TDEs. The confirmation of this similarity motivates the importance of prompt and multi-wavelength follow-up of featureless and luminous TDEs in order to further explore the connection they have with jetted TDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity &amp; large effective area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave (GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their applications in gravity and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Revealing Dark Matter's Role in Neutron Stars Anisotropy: A Bayesian Approach Using Multi-messenger Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</description>

      <title>Catalog of very-high-energy emitting active galactic nuclei at high Galactic latitudes</title>

Abstract: Large number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) producing Very-High-Energy (VHE) gamma-rays (energies above 100~GeV) has been revealed using observations with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). However, our knowledge of the VHE emitting AGN population is limited in the absence of an unbiased sky survey. We use long exposure of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to perform a survey of VHE emitting AGN at Galactic latitudes |b|&gt;10 degrees. We consider clustering of gamma-ray events with energies E&gt;100 GeV around positions of AGN from the 4-th LAT source catalog to select sources detected in the VHE range. The VHE AGN catalog produced in this way contains overall 175 sources detected with high confidence and additional 100 sources detected at more than 3-sigma level. It is 90% complete at the flux limit 1.3e-12 erg/cm2s. Less than half of the source sample (71) are previously reported VHE emitters, other sources are new detections in the VHE band. The majority of VHE AGN detectable at the survey flux limit are BL Lac type objects. We find their luminosity function to derive their spatial density (6.5+/-0.5)e-7/ Mpc3 and the characteristic luminosity scale ~1e44 erg/s. Ten sources in the VHE AGN catalog are nearby radio galaxies and seven are flat spectrum radio quasars, while 20 sources are unclassified AGN. We also include in our catalog four unidentified sources that may or may not be VHE AGN. 63 source in the catalog are "extreme" blazars, with 41 of them being new VHE band detections. In spite of the fact that the VHE flux is heavily attenuated by the pair production in interactions with Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), the catalog includes 7 sources at redshift larger than 1. Some of these sources show peculiar hardening of the VHE band spectra that point either to errors in redshift determination, or to limitations of modeling of cosmological evolution of EBL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) is a needed input to determine the neutron-star global properties and to relate them. It is thus important to provide consistent and unified EoSs to avoid possible biases in the analyses coming from the use of inconsistent EoSs. We propose a numerical tool, CUTER, allowing the user to consistently match a nuclear-physics informed crust to an arbitrary higher density EoS. We present here the second version of this tool, CUTER v2. Two functionalities are available with the CUTER v2 tool, allowing the user to reconstruct either the whole (outer and inner) crust, or the outer crust only. We show that the code, that has been tested and validated for use by the astrophysical community, is able to efficiently perform both tasks, allowing the computation of neutron-star global properties in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>Identifying Merger-Driven Long Gamma-Ray Bursts based on Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified as Type I GRBs originated from compact binary mergers and Type II GRBs originated from massive collapsars. While Type I GRBs are typically shorter than 2 seconds, recent observations suggest that some extend to tens of seconds, forming a potential subclass, Type IL GRBs. However, apart from their association with kilonovae, so far no rapid identification is possible. Given the uncertainties and limitations of optical and infrared afterglow observations, an identification method based solely on prompt emission can make such identification possible for many more GRBs. Interestingly, two established Type IL GRBs: GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, exhibit a three-episode structure: precursor emission (PE), main emission (ME), and extended emission. Therefore, we comprehensively search for GRBs in the Fermi/GBM catalog and identify 29 three-episode GRBs. Based on 12 parameters, we utilize machine learning to distinguish Type IL GRBs from Type II GRBs. Apart from GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, we are able to identify six more previously unknown Type IL GRBs: GRB 090831, GRB 170228A, GRB 180605A, GRB 200311A, GRB 200914A, and GRB 211019A. We find that Type IL GRBs are characterized by short duration and minimum variability timescale of PE, a short waiting time between PE and ME, and that ME follows the $E_{\rm p,z}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation of Type I GRBs. For the first time, we identify a high-significant PE in the confirmed Type IL GRB 060614.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational waves and multi-messenger Astronomy to reverse-engineer the properties of galactic nuclei</title>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$ is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel. The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry, islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and NSCs out to high redshift.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars have traditionally been used for research into fundamental physics and astronomy. In this paper, we investigate the expanding applications of radio pulsars in societal and industrial domains beyond their conventional scientific roles. We describe emerging applications in positioning, navigation, timing and synchronization, random number generation, space weather monitoring, public engagement, antenna calibration techniques, and leveraging extensive pulsar data sets generated by large-scale observatories. Such pulsar data sets have already been used to demonstrate quantum-computing algorithms.
  We evaluate the potential for compact radio receiver systems for pulsar detection by describing optimal observing bands. We show that relatively simple and compact receiver systems can detect the brightest pulsar, Vela. The equivalent of an ~4m-diameter dish with a small bandwidth operating around 700 MHz would be able to detect many more pulsars. Such a detector would be able to localise itself to around 10 km using pulsar navigation techniques.
  The space weather community requires direct measurements of the integrated electron density at a range of solar elongations. The only method to get model-independent values is through pulsar observations and we explore the possibility of measuring dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures with a range of telescopes (observing from low to mid-frequencies) as well as using a typical model to predict the variation of the DM as a function of solar radii. We review how pulsars can be used to produce random sequences and demonstrate that such sequences can be produced using the scintillation properties of pulsars as well as from pulse jitter.</description>

Abstract: SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Higgsino at CTAO-North within the Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higgsino dark matter (DM) could be discovered within the next few years using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory's soon-to-be-operational northern site (CTAO-North). A 1.1 TeV thermal higgsino is a highly motivated yet untested model of DM. Despite its strong theoretical motivation in supersymmetry and beyond, the higgsino is notoriously difficult to detect; it lies deep within the neutrino fog of direct detection experiments and could pose a challenge even for a future muon collider. We show that, in contrast, higgsino detection could be possible within this decade with CTAO-North in La Palma, Spain. The Galactic Center is the region where the dominant DM annihilation signature emerges, but it only barely rises above the horizon at the CTAO-North site. However, we project that this challenge can be overcome with large-zenith-angle observations at the northern site, enabling the conclusive detection of a higgsino signal by 2030 for a range of DM density profiles in the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), employ synthetic Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) to cancel the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise. The phase readouts at each spacecraft are combined with a carefully designed collection of time delays that cancel the laser frequency noise. The same collection of time delays must be applied to the GW signal models used for analysis, along with geometrical factors that encode the projection of the wave polarization tensor onto the arms of the interferometer. In principle, fully generic TDI calculations require the GW signal model to be evaluated at dozens of delay times for each data sample, a process that would require tens of millions of evaluations for a year-long signal. Here, a new method is presented that cuts the computational cost by a factor of ten thousand compared to a direct implementation at the data sample cadence, while incurring no loss in accuracy. The approach works for completely general spacecraft orbits and any flavor of TDI.</description>

      <title>Bulk Viscosity of Two-Flavor Color Superconducting Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the bulk viscosity of warm, dense,
  neutrino-transparent, color-superconducting quark matter, where
  damping of density oscillations in the kHz frequency range arises
  from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes involving
  quarks. We study the two-flavor red-green paired
  color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing for the presence
  of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all
  flavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
  (NJL) model, extended to include both vector interactions and the
  't Hooft determinant term. The primary focus is on how variations in
  the NJL Lagrangian parameters - specifically, the diquark and vector
  coupling strengths - affect both the static properties of quark
  matter, such as its equation of state and composition, and its
  dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and associated damping
  timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and corresponding
  damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude upon
  varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and
  by a lesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily
  arises from the susceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller
  contribution from modifications to the weak interaction rates. In
  comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have a more limited
  impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is similar
  quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of
  dissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting
  cores.</description>

      <title>The Evolution Of Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>

Abstract: Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection, collisionless shocks, and turbulence, are fundamental to the dynamics of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Simulating these processes often requires particle-in-cell (PIC) methods, but the computational cost of fully kinetic simulations can necessitate the use of artificial parameters, such as a reduced speed of light and ion-to-electron mass ratio, to decrease expense. While these approximations can preserve overall dynamics under specific conditions, they introduce nontrivial impacts on particle collisionality that are not yet well understood. In this work, we develop a method to scale particle collisionality in simulations employing such approximations. By introducing species-dependent scaling factors, we independently adjust inter- and intra-species collision rates to better replicate the collisional properties of the physical system. Our approach maintains the fidelity of electron and ion transport properties while preserving critical relaxation rates, such as energy exchange timescales, within the limits of weakly collisional plasma theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of this scaling method through benchmarking tests against theoretical relaxation rates and connecting to fluid theory, highlighting its ability to retain key transport properties. Existing collisional PIC implementations can be easily modified to include this scaling, which will enable deeper insights into the behavior of marginally collisional plasmas across various contexts.</description>

      <title>The Compton-thick AGN Population and the $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution of Low-mass AGN in our Cosmic Backyard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN) population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples. We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an $N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the $\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast, the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as $\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates, and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} &lt;$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Measurement of Heavy Element Abundances of Wolf-Rayet Stars in the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra} observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature, non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit, taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds, which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances, which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow onto Sgr A*, are addressed.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonlinearities on relativistic dynamical tides in compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of a neutron star in a binary inspiral driven by the emission of gravitational waves affects the orbital dynamics and produces a measurable modulation of the waves. Late in the inspiral, a regime of dynamical tides takes over from a prior regime of static tides. A recent analysis by Yu et al. [M.N.R.A.S. 519, 4325 (2022)] reveals that nonlinear aspects of the tidal interaction are important during the regime of dynamical tides. Their theoretical framework is grounded in Newtonian gravity and fluid mechanics, and relies on a representation of the tidal deformation in terms of the star's normal modes of vibration. We confirm their observation in a general relativistic treatment of the tidal deformation of a neutron star, without relying on a mode representation of this deformation. The starting point of our description is a simultaneous time-derivative and nonlinear expansion of the tidal deformation, expressed in terms of three encapsulating constants, the static $k_2$, dynamic $\ddot{k}_2$, and nonlinear $p_2$ tidal constants. We describe the neutron star's deformation in terms of a well-defined quadrupole moment tensor, which is related to the tidal quadrupole moment through a frequency-domain response function $\tilde{k}_2(\omega)$. In a pragmatic extension of our simultaneous expansion, we express this in a form proportional to $(1-\omega^2/\omega_*^2)^{-1}$, the characteristic response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to a driving force of frequency $\omega$, with a natural-frequency parameter $\omega_*$ constructed from the tidal constants. We compute these for polytropic stellar models, and show that the nonlinear constant $p_2$ lowers the frequency parameter by as much as 15% relative to an estimation based on a purely linear treatment of the tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of &lt; 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.</description>

      <title>The interplay of the parametric instability and MRI in oscillatory shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability. The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end we perform three-dimensional, magneto+hydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function, to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows which resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response, and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>

      <title>Radio-loud AGN morphology and host-galaxy properties in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-loud active galaxies (RLAGN) can exhibit various morphologies. The Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classifications, which are defined by the locations of peaks in surface brightness, have been applied to many catalogues of RLAGN. The FR classifications were initially found to correlate with radio luminosity. However, recent surveys have demonstrated that radio luminosity alone does not reliably predict radio morphology. We have devised a new-semi automated method involving ridgeline characterisations to compile the largest known classified catalogue of RLAGN to date with data from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2). We reassess the FR divide and its cause by examining the physical and host galaxy properties of $3590$ FRIIs and $2354$ FRIs (at $z \leq 0.8$). We find that RLAGN near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$ are more likely to show FRI over FRII morphology if they occupy more massive host galaxies. We find no correlation, when considering selection effects, between the FR break luminosity and stellar mass or host-galaxy rest-frame absolute magnitude. Overall, we find the cause of different radio morphologies in this sample to be complex. Considering sources near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$, we find evidence to support inner environment having a role in determining jet disruption. We make available a public catalogue of morphologies for our sample, which will be of use for future investigations of RLAGN and their impact on their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$Galaxy Cross-Power Spectrum with the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50 Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation. Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift bins spanning $0.05 &lt; z &lt;0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale $k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as FRB surveys expand.</description>

      <title>The Highest-Energy Neutrino Event Constrains Dark Matter-Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter-neutrino interactions affect the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos, attenuating the flux of neutrinos arriving at Earth. Using the highest-energy neutrino event detected to date by the KM3NeT collaboration as an example, and assuming an extragalactic origin, we derive limits on these interactions at $E_\nu = 220^{+570}_{-110}\, \mathrm{PeV}$. Considering only the propagation on the Milky Way Dark Matter halo, we constrain the interaction cross section over the mass of the Dark Matter candidate to be, $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-22}$~cm$^2$~GeV$^{-1}$. If a transient source was positively identified, the high-energy neutrino would have crossed the dark-matter halo of the source host as well, resulting in more stringent constraints (e.g., up to $ \sim$ 6 orders of magnitude assuming the blazar PKS 0605-085 is the source). These bounds on the Dark Matter-neutrino interaction cross section are translated into limits on the mass of the Dark Matter candidate, the mass of the mediator, and the coupling strength for different simplified models. In particular, we find that the KM3-230213A high-energy event sets the most stringent constraints on models where the scattering cross section rises in the high-energy limit. We identify vector Dark Matter interacting with neutrinos via vector mediators as the most promising scenario, and show that high-energy neutrinos provide world-leading limits in this model, testing the region of parameter space motivated by thermal freeze-out.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to a significant hardening phase transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by gravitational-wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. We model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to scouring by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic center density of around $10^6\,M_\odot/\mathrm{pc}^3$ is favored across most of the parameter space, shedding light on environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on color-flavor locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations play a crucial role in understanding the processes within compact stars. A recent study measured the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating its mass at $M=0.77^{+0.20}_ {-0.17} \ M_\odot$ and radius at $R = 10.40^{+0.86}_{-0.78} \ \mathrm{km}$, identifying it as the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of approximately $1.17 \ M_\odot$, raising the question of whether this object is a typical neutron star or possibly an "exotic" star. To investigate, we utilize the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 measurement with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we construct hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, introducing a phase transition through Maxwell construction. Our findings reveal that absolutely stable CFL quark matter effectively explains all observed measurements, including the central object of HESS J1731-347, whereas hybrid models incorporating the CFL MIT Bag model cannot account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT Discovery of a Gamma-ray Outburst from the Peculiar Compact Steep Spectrum Radiogalaxy 3C 216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3C 216 is an extragalactic radio source classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) object, associated with the source 4FGL J0910.0+4257 detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The source exhibits extended radio structures as well as an inner relativistic jet. In general, jets accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are efficient sources of non-thermal radiation, spanning from the radio band to X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Due to relativistic beaming, much of this radiation, particularly in the high-energy domain, is concentrated within a narrow cone aligned with the jet's direction. Consequently, high-energy emission is more easily detected in blazars, where the jet is closely aligned with the line of sight of the observer. Beginning in 2022 November, Fermi-LAT observed increased gamma-ray activity from 3C 216, culminating in a strong outburst in 2023 May. This event was followed up by observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope. In this work, we perform a careful analysis of the multifrequency data (gamma ray, X-ray, UV, optical) collected during this observational campaign. We find that the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the flaring source evolves in a coherent way, supporting a common origin for the multifrequency emission. These results suggest that the SED observed during the outburst was dominated by a single emission zone, where synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes played a primary role. Since single-zone SSC models have typically fewer free parameters than multizone alternatives, they are a powerful probe of the physical conditions of the high-energy emitting regions. Therefore, observing SSC radiation even in CSS sources improves our understanding of the production of high-energy radiation in AGN jets.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis and Simulations of the Cosmic-Ray Streaming Instability: the Importance of Oblique Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) is believed to play an important role in CR transport and CR feedback to galaxies. It drives the growth of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that scatter CRs, and leads to energy/momentum exchange between CRs and interstellar medium. Despite extensive research on CRSI, its dependence on the thermodynamic state of the gas and its multidimensional effects have not been systematically studied. In this study, we derive the dispersion relation of the CRSI for three types of MHD waves including their dependence on propagation direction and plasma $\beta$ (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure). We verify the analytical dispersion relation with one-dimensional and two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic particle-in-cell simulations. Furthermore, we use 2D simulations to investigate the role of oblique MHD waves in scattering CRs, and find that these waves are important in helping low-energy particles overcome the 90-degree pitch angle barrier. While magnetosonic waves tend to be damped by transit time damping under typical conditions, oblique Alfv\'en waves likely play an important role in low-$\beta$ plasmas.</description>

      <title>Expectation for the MeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a multi-D Monte Carlo radiation transport code, assuming spherical symmetry in the background medium and the photon sources distribution, and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.01-0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.</description>

      <title>The FAST Globular Cluster Pulsar Survey (GC FANS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By January 2025, 60 pulsars were discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope globular cluster (GC) pulsar survey (GC FANS), with spin periods spanning 1.98 ms to 3960.72 ms. Of these, 55 are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; $P&lt;30$ ms), while 34 are binaries with orbital periods spanning 0.12 days to 466.47 days. This paper describes GC FANS, a deep, thorough search for pulsars in 41 GCs in the FAST sky ($-14^\circ &lt; \delta &lt; 65^\circ$) and describes new discoveries in 14 of them. We present updated timing solutions for M92A, NGC 6712A, M71A, and M71E, all of which are ``spider'' pulsars with short orbital periods. We present new timing solutions for M71B, C, and D. With orbital periods of $\sim$466 and 378 days, M71B and M71C are the widest known GC binaries; these systems resemble the normal wide MSP-He WD systems in the Galactic disk. With a spin period of 101 ms, M71D is in an eccentric ($e\sim$0.63) orbit with an 11-day period and a massive companion; the system has a total mass of $2.63 \pm 0.08 \, M_{\odot}$. These features and its large characteristic age suggest it is a double neutron star system (DNS) formed via massive binary evolution early in the cluster's history, akin to Galactic disk DNSs--unlike other candidate GC DNSs, which typically form dynamically. A comparative analysis of GC pulsar populations within FAST's sky reveals that most clusters (10 of 14) resemble the Galactic disk MSP population, likely due to lower stellar densities.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave timbre, the relative amplitude and phase of the different frequency harmonics, can change due to interactions with low-mass halos. We focus on binaries in the LISA range and find that the integrated lens effect of cold dark matter structures can be used to probe the existence of $M_{\rm v}\lesssim 10\, M_{\odot}$ halos if a single binary with eccentricity $e=0.3-0.6$ is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio $100 - 10^3$ and it is at $z_s=0.5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

Abstract: The eikonal limit of black hole quasinormal modes (the large multipole limit $\ell \gg 1$) can be realized geometrically as a next-to-leading order solution to the geometric optics approximation, and also as linear fluctuations about the Penrose limit plane wave adapted to the lightring. Extending this interpretation beyond the linear order in perturbation theory requires a robust understanding of quadratic quasinormal modes for large values of $\ell$. We analyze numerically the relative excitation of quadratic to linear quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black holes, with two independent methods. Our results suggest that the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes for the $\ell \times \ell \to 2\ell$ channel converges towards a finite value for large $\ell$, in sharp contrast with a recent proposal inspired by the Penrose limit perspective. On the other hand, the $2 \times \ell \to \ell + 2$ channel seems to have a linearly growing ratio. Nevertheless, we show that there is no breakdown of black hole perturbation theory for physically realistic initial data.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We discuss the measured accretion rate in the context of the Shakura and Sunyaev formalism and debate the viscous mechanisms at play, finishing with a list of prospects for future work.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>
