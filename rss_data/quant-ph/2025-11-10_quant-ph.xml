      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Real-time magnetic field noise correction using trapped-ion monitor qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor" qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Security Evaluation of Quantum Circuit Split Compilation under an Oracle-Guided Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are systematically tested against input-output observations, with iteratively pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new protection schemes.</description>

      <title>Ballistic bosonic noise suppression with hybrid qumode-qubit rotation gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code (qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean \mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV) interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success probabilities~$&gt;0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})&lt;0.5$. This suppression scheme works by conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer. Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity (like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.</description>

      <title>Programmable Adiabatic Rapid Passage laser pulses for Ultra-fast Gates on trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.</description>

      <title>Spin-Network Quantum Reservoir Computing with Distributed Inputs: The Role of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic paradigm, and its quantum implementation using spin networks has shown some advantage when entanglement is present. Here, we consider a distributed scenario in which two distinct input time series are injected into separate qubits of a spin-network reservoir. We investigate how the overall entanglement, as well as its localization in the system, influence the performance of the reservoir. Focusing on bilinear memory tasks that require computing the product of the two inputs, we evaluate the short-term memory capacity and correlate it with logarithmic negativity as a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that short-term memory capacity reaches its maximum at relatively small coupling strengths. In contrast, average entanglement peaks at larger couplings. Analyzing entanglement across all bipartitions, we find that the entanglement between the two input qubits is consistently the strongest and most relevant for task performance. In the small coupling strength regime where the short-term memory capacity is maximized, the reservoir exhibits an extended memory tail: performance remains high for a long time. Finally, a pronounced dip in performance at zero time delay, observed across frequencies, indicates that information requires a finite propagation time through the reservoir before it can be effectively recalled. In summary, our results show that moderate entanglement, particularly between the two input qubits, plays a key role in enhancing short-term memory performance.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Universal and Tunable Sudden Freezing of Entanglement Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a system where two identical two-level atoms interact with their common one-mode cavity field, it is shown that entanglement can become abruptly frozen in time, remaining at a constant value for a period of time until it begins to thaw from this value from the entanglement sharing perspective [Ding et al., Phys. Rev. A 103, 032418 (2021)]. We generalize this exotic behavior of entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits, instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Representational power of selected neural network quantum states in second quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way, compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J. Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Local-Volatility Option Pricing via the Kolmogorov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of option-pricing problems may turn out to be computationally demanding due to non-linear and path-dependent payoffs, the high dimensionality arising from multiple underlying assets, and sophisticated models of price dynamics. In this context, quantum computing has been proposed as a means to address these challenges efficiently. Prevailing approaches either simulate the stochastic differential equations governing the forward dynamics of underlying asset prices or directly solve the backward pricing partial differential equation. Here, we present an end-to-end quantum algorithmic framework that solves the Kolmogorov forward (Fokker-Planck) partial differential equation for local-volatility models by mapping it to a Hamiltonian-simulation problem via the Schr\"odingerisation technique. The algorithm specifies how to prepare the initial quantum state, perform Hamiltonian simulation, and how to efficiently recover the option price via a swap test. In particular, the efficiency of the final solution recovery is an important advantage of solving the forward versus the backward partial differential equation. Thus, our end-to-end framework offers a potential route toward quantum advantage for challenging option-pricing tasks. In particular, we obtain a polynomial advantage in grid size for the discretization of a single dimension. Nevertheless, the true power of our methodology lies in pricing high-dimensional systems, such as baskets of options, because the quantum framework admits an exponential speedup with respect to dimension, overcoming the classical curse of dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a distributed quantum algorithm for solving counting problem using Grover operator and a classical post-processing procedure. We apply the proposed algorithm to estimate inner products and Hamming distances.

      <title>Hybrid action Reinforcement Learning for quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04967v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, as manual or heuristic designs often yield suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework that integrates discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that optimize circuit structure and parameters separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns both topology and initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) environment, the agent autonomously constructs circuits that minimize molecular ground-state energy. Experimental results demonstrate that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and more compact circuit structures compared with discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space yields superior parameter initializations, producing post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower minima. These findings suggest that hybrid-action reinforcement learning offers a principled pathway toward automated and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.</description>

      <title>Single and Double-click High-Rate Entanglement Generation Between Distant Ions Using Multiplexed Atomic Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an accompanying paper [1], we introduced an approach to interface trapped-ion quantum processors with ensemble-based quantum memories by matching a spontaneous parametric down conversion source to both the ions and the memories. This enables rapid entanglement generation between single trapped ions separated by distances of hundreds of kilometers. In this article, we extend the protocol and provide additional details of the analysis. Particularly, we compare a double-click and single-click approaches for the ion edge nodes. The double-click approach relaxes the phase stability requirement but is strongly affected by finite efficiencies. Choosing the optimal protocol thus depends on the access to the phase stabilization as well as the efficiency of interface of the ions and ensemble-based memories.</description>

      <title>Several kinds of Gaussian quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering is a crucial quantum resource that lies intermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Gaussian channels, meanwhile, play a foundational role in diverse quantum protocols, secure communication, and related fields. In this paper, we focus on several classes of Gaussian channels associated with quantum steering: Gaussian steering-annihilating channels, Gaussian steering-breaking channels, Gaussian unsteerable channels, and maximal Gaussian unsteerable channels. We give the concepts of these channels, derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally, since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.</description>

Abstract: Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz) continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure, practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security. Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Frequency Collisions in Parametrically Modulated Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a leading platform for scalable quantum computing, where parametric modulation is a widely used technique for implementing high-fidelity multi-qubit operations. A critical challenge, however, is that this modulation can induce a dense landscape of parasitic couplings, leading to detrimental frequency collisions that constrain processor performance. In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical framework, grounded in Floquet theory, to systematically analyze and mitigate these collisions. Our approach integrates this numerical analysis with newly derived analytical models for both qubit-modulated and coupler-modulated schemes, allowing us to characterize the complete map of parasitic sideband interactions and their distinct error budgets. This analysis forms the basis of a constraint-based optimization methodology designed to identify parameter configurations that satisfy the derived physical constraints, thereby avoiding detrimental parasitic interactions. We illustrate the utility of this framework with applications to analog quantum simulation and gate design. Our work provides a predictive tool for co-engineering device parameters and control protocols, enabling the systematic suppression of crosstalk and paving the way for large-scale, high-performance quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Bounds on quantum Fisher information and uncertainty relations for thermodynamically conjugate variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations represent a foundational principle in quantum mechanics, imposing inherent limits on the precision with which \textit{mechanically} conjugate variables such as position and momentum can be simultaneously determined. This work establishes analogous relations for \textit{thermodynamically} conjugate variables -- specifically, a classical intensive parameter $\theta$ and its corresponding extensive quantum operator $\hat{O}$ -- in equilibrium states. We develop a framework to derive a rigorous thermodynamic uncertainty relation for such pairs, where the uncertainty of the classical parameter $\theta$ is quantified by its quantum Fisher information $\mathcal{F}_\theta$. The framework is based on an exact integral representation that relates $\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$ to the autocorrelation function of operator $\hat{O}$. From this representation, we derive a tight upper bound for the quantum Fisher information, which yields a thermodynamic uncertainty relation: $\Delta\theta\,\overline{\Delta O} \ge k_\text{B}T$ with $\overline{\Delta O}\equiv\partial_\theta\langle\hat{O}\rangle\,\Delta\theta$ and $T$ is the system temperature. The result establishes a fundamental precision limit for quantum sensing and metrology in thermal systems, directly connecting it to the thermodynamic properties of linear response and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Channel Superposition Mitigates Photon Loss Errors in Quantum Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum illumination, the probe photon is entangled with an ancilla photon, and both are jointly measured at the end. The entanglement between the probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols: indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment (PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage. The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less potent alternative.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Teleportation Against Noise Using Weak Measurement and Flip Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs) with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC), and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness, particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel scheme for coherent manipulation of populations and robust creation of arbitrary coherent superposition of metastable states of a quantum system with lambda configuration of operating energy levels using laser pulses with a quadratically chirped carrier frequency. The case of a single broadband laser pulse is considered, when the frequency spectrum of the pulse exceeds the frequency distance between the metastable energy levels of the system. The results of the dressed state analysis and numerical simulation are presented, demonstrating reliable and robust creation of an arbitrary coherent superposition of metastable states by changing the parameters of laser pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system wherein two legitimate users attempt to exchange secret keys over free-space optical (FSO) channels. Novel frameworks for the use of the one- and two-way discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocols, employing weak coherent pulses and decoy states, are presented. Focusing on the case where a photon-number-splitting attack is adopted by the eavesdropper and the legitimate multi-antenna receiver using threshold detection for the key extraction, novel expressions for the secret key rate and quantum bit error rate for both one- and two-way protocols are derived. The performance gain with larger MIMO configurations and the tradeoff between the performances with the one- and the two-way protocols with respect to the transmission distance of the legitimate FSO link are numerically assessed.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Information Reconciliation for Decoy-State Quantum Key Distribution over a Satellite Downlink Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic solution that leverages the properties of quantum mechanics to be resistant and secure even against an attacker with unlimited computational power. Satellite-based links are important in QKD because they can reach distances that the best fiber systems cannot. However, links between satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and ground stations have a duration of only a few minutes, resulting in the generation of a small amount of secure keys. In this context, we investigate the optimization of the information reconciliation step of the QKD post-processing in order to generate as much secure key as possible. As a first step, we build an accurate model of the downlink signal and quantum bit error rate (QBER) during a complete satellite pass, which are time-varying due to three effects: (i) the varying link geometry over time, (ii) the scintillation effect, and (iii) the different signal intensities adopted in the Decoy-State protocol. Leveraging the a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER, we improve the efficiency of information reconciliation (IR) (i.e., the error correction phase) in the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a secure key that is almost 3\% longer for realistic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate wavepacket dynamics for a relativistic particle in a box evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger (also known as the Salpeter) equation. We derive the solutions for an infinite well -- which contrary to the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations) -- are well defined, and use these solutions to construct wavepackets. We obtain expressions for the wavepacket revival times and explore the corresponding quantum carpets (the space-time probability density plots) for different dynamical regimes. We further analyze level spacing statistics as the dynamics goes from the non-relativistic regime to the ultra-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>CUNQA: a Distributed Quantum Computing emulator for HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of scaling quantum computers to gain computational power is expected to lead to architectures with multiple connected quantum processing units (QPUs), commonly referred to as Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC). In parallel, there is a growing momentum toward treating quantum computers as accelerators, integrating them into the heterogeneous architectures of high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This work combines these two foreseeable futures in CUNQA, an open-source DQC emulator designed for HPC environments that allows testing, evaluating and studying DQC in HPC before it even becomes real. It implements the three DQC models of no-communication, classical-communication and quantum-communication; which will be examined in this work. Addressing programming considerations, explaining emulation and simulation details, and delving into the specifics of the implementation will be part of the effort. The well-known Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is used to demonstrate and analyze the emulation of the models. To the best of our knowledge, CUNQA is the first tool designed to emulate the three DQC schemes in an HPC environment.</description>

      <title>Revocation and Reconstruction of Shared Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05212v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding. This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of parameters for which the protocol will be successful.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an \textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho = 10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with network size and remains robust for fading variances up to $\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global quantum constellations.</description>

      <title>A Triple-Hybrid Quantum Support Vector Machine Using Classical, Quantum Gate-based and Quantum Annealing-based Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the fields where quantum computers are expected to bring advantages over classical methods. However, the limited size of current computers restricts the exploitation of the full potential of quantum machine learning methods. Additionally, different computing paradigms, both quantum and classical, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Obtaining optimal results with algorithms thus requires algorithms to be tweaked to the underlying computational paradigm, and the tasks to be optimally distributed over the available computational resources. In this work, we explore the potential gains from combining different computing paradigms to solve the complex task of data classification for three different datasets. We use a gate-based quantum model to implement a quantum kernel and implement a complex feature map. Next, we formulate a quadratic unconstrained optimisation problem to be solved on quantum annealing hardware. We then evaluate the losses on classical hardware and reconfigure the model parameters accordingly. We tested this so-called triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine on various data sets, and find that it achieves higher precision than other support vector machines (both quantum and classical) on complex quantum data, whereas it achieves varying performance on simple classical data using limited training. For the complex data sets, the triple-hybrid version converges faster, requiring fewer circuit evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Gate-Based Quantum Genetic Algorithm for Real-Valued Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced, enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution. Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms, establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for quantum metric, Berry curvature, and quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix, indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$ density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Effects of boundary conditions on quantum nanoresonators: decoherence-free subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler-Bernoulli beam model has been studied classically and semi-classically. The semi-classical quantization is done in an analogous way to the quantization of the electromagnetic field, and we found an effect that is similar to the Casimir effect, which is the photonic Casimir effect. The Casimir force, by unit area, is proportional to the first mode energy divided by the volume of the beam. For the hinged-hinged boundary condition, degenerate states were found. These degenerate pairs form decoherence-free subspaces for dispersive thermal reservoirs. For other boundary conditions, there are also subspaces with lower decoherence rates, which occur for quasi-degenerate states.</description>

      <title>Shallow IQP circuit and graph generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distributions, we study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$ to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to $0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum generative modeling for the NISQ era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Variational noise mitigation in quantum circuits: the case of Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to simulate established quantum algorithms under realistic noise conditions, aiming to surpass the fidelity of theoretical circuits in noisy environments. Focusing on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), we perform numerical simulations for two qubits under both coherent and incoherent noise. To enhance generalization, we further introduce the use of Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) during the optimization. Our results show that the variational circuit can reproduce the QFT with higher fidelity in scenarios dominated by coherent noise. This demonstrates the potential of the approach as an effective error-mitigation strategy for small- to medium-scale quantum systems, particularly in settings where coherent noise strongly impacts performance. Beyond mitigating noise and improving fidelity, the method can be adapted to the noise profile of a specific device, providing a versatile and practical route to enhance the reliability of quantum algorithms in near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Open quantum-classical systems: A hybrid MASH master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method which combines the quantum-classical mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) with the dissipative quantum dynamics of the Lindblad master equation. Like conventional surface-hopping methods, our approach is based on classical trajectories coupled to the dynamics of a quantum subsystem. However, instead of evolving the subsystem wavefunction according to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we use stochastic quantum trajectories derived from secular Redfield theory. This enables the simulation of open quantum systems coupled simultaneously to Markovian quantum baths and anharmonic non-Markovian classical degrees of freedom. Applications to the spin-boson model and to the cavity-enhanced fluorescence of an electronically nonadiabatic molecule show excellent agreement with fully quantum-mechanical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.</description>

      <title>Mapping the positions of Two-Level-Systems on the surface of a superconducting transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is severely limited by material defects that create parasitic two-level-systems (TLS). Progress is complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit. We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit design and fabrication methods.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Coherence of an Excited-State Transition in $\text{Tm}^{3+}$:$\text{YAlO}_{3}$ at Telecommunication Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05370v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the spectroscopic and coherence properties of the 1451.37 nm excited-state zero-phonon line (ZPL) between the $^{3}F_{4}$ and the $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds of a thulium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite ($\text{Tm}^{3+}$:$\text{YAlO}_{3}$) crystal at temperatures around 1.5 K. We measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times, finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum phase estimation can be better than non-adaptive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the most important tools in quantum algorithms. It can be made non-adaptive (meaning all applications of the unitary $U_\phi$ happen simultaneously) without using more applications of $U_\phi$, albeit at the expense of using many more qubits. It is also known that there is no advantage for adaptive algorithms in the case where the phase that needs to be estimated is arbitrary or is uniformly random. Here we give examples of a special case of phase estimation, with a promise on the values that the unknown phase can take, where adaptive methods are provably better than non-adaptive methods by a factor of nearly 2 in the number of uses of $U_\phi$. We also prove some upper bounds on the maximum advantage that adaptive algorithms for phase estimation can achieve over non-adaptive ones.</description>

      <title>Strain-engineered nanoscale spin polarization reversal in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control solid-state quantum emitters is fundamental to advancing quantum technologies. The performance of these systems is fundamentally governed by their spin-dependent photodynamics, yet conventional control methods using cavities offer limited access to key non-radiative processes. Here we demonstrate that anisotropic lattice strain serves as a powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems. Under high pressure, giant shear strain gradients trigger a complete reversal of the intrinsic spin polarization, redirecting ground-state population from $|0\rangle$ to $|\pm 1\rangle$ manifold. We show that this reprogramming arises from strain-induced mixing of the NV center's excited states and dramatic alteration of intersystem crossing, which we quantify through a combination of opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model that disentangles symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking strain contributions. Furthermore, the polarization reversal is spatially mapped with a transition region below 120 nm, illustrating sub-diffraction-limit control. Our work establishes strain engineering as a powerful tool for tailoring quantum emitter properties, opening avenues for programmable quantum light sources, high-density spin-based memory, and hybrid quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from effective $200$-qubit holographic random circuit sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of outperforming classical computers in solving certain problems. While large-scale quantum algorithms will require fault-tolerant devices, near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage on existing devices can provide important milestones. Random circuit sampling has emerged as a leading candidate for such demonstrations. However, existing implementations often underutilize circuit depth, limiting the achievable advantage. We introduce a holographic random circuit sampling algorithm that substantially increases the sampling complexity by leveraging repeated interactions and mid-circuit measurements. This approach scales the effective sampling dimension with the circuit depth, ultimately leading to an exponential growth in sampling complexity. With merely 20 physical qubits on IBM quantum devices, we experimentally demonstrate the effective sampling of up to 200 qubits, with a cross-entropy benchmark fidelity of $0.0593$, establishing a new route to scalable quantum advantage through the combined use of spatial and temporal quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Realization of Thread Level Parallelism on Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up quantum devices is a central challenge for realizing practical quantum computation. Modular quantum architectures promise scalability, yet experiments to date have relied on either $\sim\!10^{3}$-qubit monolithic chips or fragile interconnects with high loss. Here, we introduce a classical linkage scheme that merges multiple independent quantum processing units (QPUs) into a single logical device, enabling thread-level parallelism (TLP). Theoretically, we show that quantum routines with product-state inputs and low-rank entangling layers can be re-expressed in an efficient parallelizable form. Experimentally, we validate this architecture on clusters comprising up to sixteen benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum nodes. A four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is partitioned into parallel two-qubit subcircuits, achieving a fidelity of $93.8\,\%$ with respect to the ideal state. A non-Hermitian evolution, implemented via a truncated Cauchy integral on Hermitian Hamiltonians, reproduces exact observables with high accuracy. Our results demonstrate that classical links suffice to scale up the logical size of quantum computations and realize general, non-unitary channels on today's hardware, opening an experimentally accessible route toward software-defined, clustered quantum accelerators.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between complexity and energy in quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the desire to make quantum technologies more sustainable, in this work we introduce a framework for analysing the interplay between complexity and energy cost of quantum procedures. In particular, we study a sequential quantum phase estimation protocol, where a phase of physical significance is encoded in a quantum channel. The channel is applied to a probe state repetitively until the probe is measured and the outcome leads to an estimate on the phase. We establish a trade-off relation between the implementation energy of the channel and the number of times it is applied (complexity), while reaching a desired estimation precision. The principles of our analysis can be adapted to optimise the energy consumption in other quantum protocols and devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Quantinuum Helios, a 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Helios features $^{137}$Ba$^{+}$ hyperfine qubits, all-to-all connectivity enabled by a rotatable ion storage ring connecting two quantum operation regions by a junction, speed improvements from parallelized operations, and a new software stack with real-time compilation of dynamic programs. Averaged over all operational zones in the system, we achieve average infidelities of $2.5(1)\times10^{-5}$ for single-qubit gates, $7.9(2)\times10^{-4}$ for two-qubit gates, and $4.8(6)\times10^{-4}$ for state preparation and measurement, none of which are fundamentally limited and likely able to be improved. These component infidelities are predictive of system-level performance in both random Clifford circuits and random circuit sampling, the latter demonstrating that Helios operates well beyond the reach of classical simulation and establishes a new frontier of fidelity and complexity for quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Simulation of stabilizer circuits is a well-studied problem in quantum information processing, with a number of highly optimized algorithms available. Yet, we argue that further improvements can arise from the theoretical structure of stabilizer operations themselves. We focus on the subclass of stabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving stabilizer operations, which naturally appear in fault-tolerant computations over CSS stabilizer codes. Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques, we show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic circuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no computational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits. To clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard quadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). It provides an efficient way to describe compositions of stabilizer operations and thus to simulate stabilizer circuits. CSS-preserving operations correspond to purely linear forms, which under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier transform yield a noncontextual hidden variable model, providing an alternative proof of the introduced rewriting. Finally, we develop a theory of reference frames for multiqubit systems, where frames are encoded by quadratic forms. This allows us to express stabilizer operations as probabilistic maps for proper reference frames. Non-CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits require dynamical modifications of reference frames, embodying a contextuality resource that leads to the computational overhead. This framework provides a new perspective on simulating stabilizer and near-stabilizer circuits within dynamically evolving quasiprobability models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tensor Representation via Circuit Partitioning and Reintegration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing enables faster computations than clas-sical algorithms through superposition and entanglement. Circuit cutting and knitting are effective techniques for ame-liorating current noisy quantum processing unit (QPUs) er-rors via a divide-and-conquer approach that splits quantum circuits into subcircuits and recombines them using classical post-processing. The development of circuit partitioning and recomposing has focused on tailoring the simulation frame-work by replacing generic non-local gates with probabilistic local gates and measuring the classical communication com-plexity. Designing a protocol that supports algorithms and non-all-to-all qubit-connected physical hardware remains underdeveloped owing to the convoluted properties of cut-ting compact controlled unitary gates and hardware topology. In this study, we introduce shardQ, a method that leverages the SparseCut algorithm with matrix product state (MPS) compilation and a global knitting technique. This method elucidates the optimal trade-off between the computational time and error rate for quantum encoding with a theoretical proof, evidenced by an ablation analysis using an IBM Mar-rakesh superconducting-type QPU. This study also presents the results regarding application readiness.</description>

      <title>Establishing a pre-logical setting in a quantum model of psycho-analytic theory</title>

Abstract: A crucial issue both in cognitive and psychoanalytical theories deals with the origin of mental representations. In order to explore this issue, the paper analyzes a pre-logical setting, by considering a formalized approach to the foundations of psychoanalysis in logic, interpreting and integrating the views by Freud, Matte Blanco, Klein and Bion. The formalized approach derives from a quantum model of spin states. A representation of the spin state of a particle in first order logic is abstracted to get a modality interpretable as an abstract projector. The last can be decomposed into a positive, negative and irreal component. The irreal component cannot emerge and, in logic, is absorbed by the two others, giving rise to logical duality. Due to its treatment of undefiniteness and coherence, the paper is meant to contribute to quantum cognition, in its particular sense of affective quantum cognition.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics-induced breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices. Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms. We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</description>

Abstract: We present a (1+1)-dimensional quantum model designed to describe nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) in homonuclear diatomic molecules exposed to strong linearly polarized laser fields. Extending the restricted-geometry framework previously developed for atomic systems, our approach captures key features of NSDI, including the characteristic knee structure in double ionization yields. Despite its simplifying assumptions, the model shows good agreement with experimental data and proves particularly suitable for systems with $\sigma$-type orbital symmetry. It offers a computationally efficient tool for exploring multi-electron dynamics in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Convex semidefinite tensor optimization and quantum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cone of positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrices is fundamental in convex optimization, and we extend this notion to tensors, defining PSD tensors, which correspond to separable quantum states. We study the convex optimization problem over the PSD tensor cone. While this convex cone admits a smooth reparameterization through tensor factorizations (analogous to the matrix case), it is not self-dual. Moreover, there are currently no efficient algorithms for projecting onto or testing membership in this cone, and the semidefinite tensor optimization problem, although convex, is NP-hard. To address these challenges, we develop methods for computing lower and upper bounds on the optimal value of the problem. We propose a general-purpose iterative refinement algorithm that combines a lifted alternating direction method of multipliers with a cutting-plane approach. This algorithm exploits PSD tensor factorizations to produce heuristic solutions and refine the solutions using cutting planes. Since the method requires a linear minimization oracle over PSD tensors, we design a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on convex relaxations and valid inequalities. Our framework allows us to study the white-noise mixing threshold, which characterizes the entanglement properties of quantum states. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: We study the theory of, and propose an experimental design for, a Sagnac tractor atom interferometer based on a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). The atoms are trapped in counter-rotating azimuthal optical lattices, formed by interfering evanescent fields of laser modes injected into circular PIC waveguides. We develop quantum models for the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the interfering atoms in adiabatic frames, which provide computational efficiency. The theory is applied to an exemplary PIC, for which we first compute field modes and atom trapping potentials for $^{87}$Rb. We then evaluate non-adiabaticity, fidelity, and sensitivity of the exemplary PIC.</description>

Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries and induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally, we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.</description>

Abstract: The clique problems, including $k$-CLIQUE and Triangle Finding, form an important class of computational problems; the former is an NP-complete problem, while the latter directly gives lower bounds for Matrix Multiplication. A number of previous efforts have approached these problems with Quantum Computing methods, such as Amplitude Amplification. In this paper, we provide new Quantum oracle designs based on the 1-factorization of complete graphs, all of which have depth $O(n)$ instead of the $O(n^2)$ presented in previous studies. Also, we discuss the usage of one of these oracles in bringing the Triangle Finding time complexity down to $O(n^{2.25} poly(log n))$, compared to the $O(n^{2.38})$ classical record. Finally, we benchmark the number of required Amplitude Amplification iterations for another presented oracle, for solving $k$-CLIQUE.</description>

      <title>Analytical Lower Bound on Query Complexity for Transformations of Unknown Unitary Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have revealed deterministic and exact protocols for performing complex conjugation, inversion, and transposition of a general $d$-dimensional unknown unitary operation using a finite number of queries to a black-box unitary operation. In this work, we establish analytical lower bounds for the query complexity of unitary inversion, transposition, and complex conjugation, which hold even if the input unitary is an unknown logarithmic-depth unitary. Specifically, our lower bound of $d^2$ for unitary inversion demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of the deterministic exact inversion protocol, which operates with $O(d^2)$ queries. We introduce a novel framework utilizing differentiation to derive these lower bounds on query complexity for general differentiable functions $f: \mathrm{SU}(d)\to \mathrm{SU}(d)$. As a corollary, we prove that a catalytic protocol -- a new concept recently noted in the study of exact unitary inversion -- is impossible for unitary complex conjugation. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the partially known setting, where the input unitary operation is promised to be within a subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ and the probabilistic setting, where transformations succeed probabilistically.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

Abstract: While stabilizer tableaus have proven useful as a descriptive tool for additive quantum codes, they otherwise offer little guidance for concrete constructions or algorithm analysis. We introduce a representation of stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures, and prove via the ZX Calculus that this representation is related to stabilizer tableaus by an efficiently computable bijection. This gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. We construct as examples families of $[[ n, \;\Theta(\frac{n}{\log n}), \;\Theta(\log n)]]$ and $[[ n, \;\Omega(n^{4/5}), \;\Theta(n^{1/5}) ]]$ codes. We use graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. Moreover, code properties such as distance and encoding circuit depth are bounded by simple functions of the graph degree. We prove that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, minimum weight generator selection, and decoding -- are unified as instances of one optimization game on a graph. By studying this game, we construct an efficient greedy decoder and prove that it corrects all recoverable errors for all graphs with cycle lengths no shorter than 13 (reducible to 5 with mild extra constraints); these include the above two families. Our results suggest that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called $R$-parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Protecting collective qubits from non-Markovian dephasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collectively-encoded qubits, involving ensembles of atomic or solid-state emitters, present many practical advantages for quantum technologies. However, they suffer from uncontrolled inhomogeneous dephasing which couples them to a quasi-continuum of dark states. In most cases, this process cannot be encompassed in a standard master equation with time-independent coefficients, making its description either tedious or inaccurate. We show that it can be understood as a displacement in time-frequency phase space and accurately included in resource-efficient numerical simulations of the qubit's dynamics. This description unveils a regime where the qubit becomes protected from dephasing through a combination of strong driving and non-Markovianity. We experimentally investigate this regime using a Rydberg superatom and extend its coherent dynamics beyond the inhomogeneous-dephasing characteristic time by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Network-assisted collective operations for efficient distributed quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing relies on coordinated operations between remote quantum processing units (QPUs), yet most existing work either assumes full connectivity, unrealistic for large networks, or relies on entanglement swapping. To mitigate the overhead of communication, we propose a scheme for the distribution of collective quantum operations among remote quantum processing units by exploiting distributed fan-out operations to a central node in network architectures similar to those used for high-performance computing, which requires only pre-shared entanglement, local operations and classical communication. We show that a general diagonal gate can be distributed among any number of nodes and provide the ebit cost bounds. For a single distributed multicontrolled gate, this amounts to a single additional Bell pair over the theoretically optimal calculation with all-to-all pre-shared entanglement, demonstrating better scalability when compared to current proposals based on entanglement swapping through a network. We provide a recipe for the lumped distribution of gates such as arbitrarily-sized Toffoli and multicontrolled Z, and $R_{zz}(\theta)$ gates. Finally, we provide an exact implementation of a distributed Grover's search algorithm using this protocol to partition the circuit, with Bell pair cost growing linearly with the number of Grover iterations and the number of partitions, and show how these techniques can be applied to other algorithms such as QAOA. Our results show that alternative approaches to entanglement swapping can provide major benefits in distributed quantum computing, pointing to promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition and suppression of critical phase of thermofield double state in monitored quantum circuit with unitary $R$ matrix gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model and is post-selection free when an overcrossing and an undercrossing coincide. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by SWAP gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect originating from worldline braiding dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</description>

Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</description>

Abstract: Multiplexing information in different degrees of freedom and use of integrated and fiber-optic components are natural solutions to the scalability bottleneck in optical quantum communications and computing. However, for bulk-optics systems, where size, cost, stability, and reliability are factors, this remains either impractical or highly challenging to implement. In this paper we present a framework to engineer continuous-variable entanglement produced through nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in \chi^(2) nonlinear photonic lattices in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom that can solve the scalability challenge. We show how spatio-spectral pump shaping produce cluster states that are naturally distributable in quantum communication networks and a resource for measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-modulation schemes offer an alternative to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models -- such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models -- we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives as well as amplitude robustness.</description>

Abstract: The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</description>

Abstract: The mixing of scalar substances in fluid flows by stirring and diffusion is ubiquitous in natural flows, chemical engineering, and microfluidic drug delivery. Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by solving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid dynamics framework. The exact gate decompositions of the advection and diffusion operators in spectral space are derived. For all but the simplest one-dimensional flows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting to construct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity profiles in multiple dimensions, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate quantum spectral transform. We evaluate the approach in statevector simulations of a Couette flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation. For an advection-diffusion problem in one dimension, we compare the time evolution of an ideal quantum simulation with those of real quantum computers with superconducting and trapped-ion qubits. The required number of two-qubit gates grows with the logarithm of the number of grid points raised to one higher power than the order of the polynomial velocity profile.</description>

Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>

Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the same thermal steady state for both settings, although even in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents. Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme. Finally, we consider how our results are impacted when the system-environment interaction leads to strict homogenisation. Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of non-Markovian interactions.</description>

Abstract: Errors in the current generation of quantum processors pose a significant challenge towards practical-scale implementations of quantum machine learning (QML) as they lead to trainability issues arising from noise-induced barren plateaus, as well as performance degradations due to the noise accumulation in deep circuits even when QML models are free from barren plateaus. Quantum error correction (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but their extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state distillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This work proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum machine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations are omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected two-qubit Controlled-$Z$s (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models remain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\approx0.2\%$ depolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\approx0.13\%$ under randomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such as phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates that the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of over-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a quantum state away from depolarizations. While it may take several years to build quantum processors capable of fully fault-tolerant QML, our work proposes a resource-efficient solution for trainable and high-accuracy QML implementations in noisy environments.</description>

Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory (RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and (pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincar\'e-covariant (quantum) frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincar\'e covariance, with transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions, and construct an explicit example of a covariant scalar relational quantum field which is causal relative to operationally meaningful preparations of a relativistic QRF. The theory makes direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the Wightmanian test functions, and show how the properties of algebras generated by relational local observables suitably extend the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions. This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT from a relational and operational perspective.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nuclear Dynamics in First Quantization</title>

Abstract: The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research. In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO) pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporally tailored Non-Gaussian Quantum Operations in Thin-Film Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in photonic platforms have enabled the precise control of light's spectral and temporal degrees of freedom, a capability crucial for the development of scalable quantum information systems. In this work, we address the challenge of implementing spectro-temporal mode-selective non-Gaussian quantum operations, specifically single-photon subtraction (SPS) and addition (SPA), in the telecom wavelength regime. Building on prior experimental demonstrations of mode-selective near-infrared SPS, we present the first design framework for achieving mode-selective SPA and SPS using thin-film lithium niobate nonlinear waveguide platforms. We introduce an inverse-design optimization scheme by modeling the quantum-optical response via the Joint Spectral Amplitude and Transfer Function, in order to identify optimal waveguide and pump parameters that maximize mode selectivity and state purity. This approach is first tested on a metallic waveguide design. We then exploit the dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, which offer enhanced nonlinear interactions through tighter light confinement. Our findings demonstrate that tailored nonlinear processes, particularly parametric down-conversion and frequency up-conversion, can support high-fidelity non-Gaussian operations essential for next-generation quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>The simplest Kochen-Specker set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, is because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the simplest KS sets in dimension three known are asymmetrical and require a large number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here we present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025), setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number of inputs: 5-9. We establish the fundamental nature of this set in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Photon Statistics for Fock and Coherent States Interfering in a Beamsplitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a straightforward yet comprehensive theoretical study of different quantum states emerging from a bi-modal beamsplitter when various input states interfere. Specifically, we analyze the output states for different combinations of input fields, including Fock states $|n\rangle|m\rangle$, hybrid states $|n\rangle|\alpha\rangle$, and coherent states $|\alpha\rangle|\beta\rangle$. We derive explicit expressions for the output state vectors, calculate the mean photon number, photon number variance, Mandel Q parameter, and secondorder coherence function to characterize the statistical properties of the output fields. Our results are intended as a pedagogical resource, serving as an introductory reference for students and researchers aiming to understand basic photon statistics using beamsplitters.</description>

      <title>Magic tricycles: Efficient magic state generation with finite block-length quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparation of high-fidelity non-Clifford (magic) states is an essential subroutine for universal quantum computation, but imposes substantial space-time overhead. Magic state factories based on high rate and distance quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes equipped with transversal non-Clifford gates can potentially reduce these overheads significantly, by circumventing the need for multiple rounds of distillation and by producing a large number of magic states in a single code-block. As a step towards realizing efficient, fault-tolerant magic state production, we introduce a class of finite block-length quantum LDPC codes which we name tricycle codes, generalizing the well-known bicycle codes to three homological dimensions. These codes can support constant-depth physical circuits that implement logical $CCZ$ gates between three code blocks. To construct these constant-depth $CCZ$ circuits, we develop new analytical and numerical techniques that apply to a broad class of three-dimensional homological and balanced product codes. We further show that tricycle codes enable single-shot state-preparation and error correction, leading to a highly efficient magic-state generation protocol. Numerical simulations of specific codes confirm robust performance under circuit-level noise, demonstrating a high circuit-noise threshold of $&gt;0.5\%$. With modest post-selection, certain tricycle codes of block-lengths of only $50-100$ qubits are shown to achieve logical error-rates of $6\times 10^{-10}$ or lower. Finally, we construct optimal depth syndrome extraction circuits for tricycle codes and present a protocol for implementing them efficiently on a reconfigurable neutral atom platform.</description>

      <title>Application of Optimal Control to Time-Resolution Protocol for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolution protocol of quantum sensing aims to measure the fast temporal variation of an external field and demands a high field sensitivity in a short interrogation time $\tau$. Since any operation that evolves the quantum state takes time and is counted as part of the interrogation, evaluating the performance of time-resolution protocol requires a complete end-to-end description of the measurement process. In particular, the initial state has to be one of the sensor qubit's eigenstates in the absence of external fields, and the final projective measurements must be performed in the same eigenstate basis. Building upon prior works which proposed limits for time-resolved sensing using a quantum sensor, we apply optimal control theory to optimize the time-resolution protocol. Our analysis indicates that there exists a critical interrogation time $T^*$: when $\tau&lt;T^*$ the optimal protocol is purely bang-bang; when $\tau&gt;T^*$ the optimal protocol involves a singular control during the interrogation. In the short-$\tau$ regime, which is relevant to high time resolution, we propose a ``detune protocol'' that involves only smooth control during the entire interrogation. As the discontinuities of control pose the main obstacles to experimental realization, we expect the presented detune protocol to be practically useful. In the long-$\tau$ regime, the optimal protocol closely resembles the Ramsey sequence; protocols based on maximizing Quantum Fisher Information are constructed to highlight the difference between the theoretically optimal and practically implementable measurements. Effective use of the time-resolution protocol requires a setup where the unknown time-domain signal of interest can be identically and repeatedly generated. As a potentially relevant application, we outline the calibration of baseband flux pulse distortion in the control of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient and effective construction of portfolios that adhere to real-world constraints is a challenging optimization task in finance. We investigate a concrete representation of the problem with a focus on design proposals of an Exchange Traded Fund. We evaluate the sampling-based CVaR Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), combined with a local-search post-processing, for solving problem instances that beyond a certain size become classically hard. We also propose a problem formulation that is suited for sampling-based VQA. Our utility-scale experiments on IBM Heron processors involve 109 qubits and up to 4200 gates, achieving a relative solution error of 0.49%. Results indicate that a combined quantum-classical workflow achieves better accuracy compared to purely classical local search, and that hard-to-simulate quantum circuits may lead to better convergence than simpler circuits. Our work paves the path to further explore portfolio construction with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Portfolio Optimization via Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Dicke State Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a fundamental challenge in various domains, with portfolio optimization standing out as a key application in finance. Despite numerous quantum algorithmic approaches proposed for this problem, most overlook a critical feature of realistic portfolios: diversification. In this work, we introduce a novel quantum framework for multiclass portfolio optimization that explicitly incorporates diversification by leveraging multiple parametrized Dicke states, simultaneously initialized to encode the diversification constraints , as an ansatz of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. A key strength of this ansatz is that it initializes the quantum system in a superposition of only feasible states, inherently satisfying the constraints. This significantly reduces the search space and eliminates the need for penalty terms. In addition, we also analyze the impact of different classical optimizers in this hybrid quantum-classical approach. Our findings demonstrate that, when combined with the CMA-ES optimizer, the Dicke state ansatz achieves superior performance in terms of convergence rate, approximation ratio, and measurement probability. These results underscore the potential of this method to solve practical, diversification-aware portfolio optimization problems relevant to the financial sector.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Driven Quantum Battery Charging via Autonomous Thermal Machines: Energy Transfer, Memory Effects, and Ergotropy Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits, each coupled to Markovian bosonic thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence between the charger and the battery. By applying a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy; coherence driving raises the maximum ergotropy by approximately 40% compared to the case without coherence driving, and the power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the variational quantum eigensolver and quantum optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When does a variational quantum algorithm converge to a globally optimal solution? Despite the large literature around variational approaches to quantum computing, the answer is largely unknown. We address this open question by developing a convergence theory for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). By leveraging the terminology of quantum control landscapes, we prove a sufficient criterion that characterizes when convergence to a ground state of a Hamiltonian can be guaranteed for almost all initial parameter settings. More specifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows for moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded manner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates, then the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop constructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two commonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\"atze. Finally, we discuss regularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as for condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem.</description>

Abstract: Heralded multi-photon entanglement generation is a central bottleneck for photonic quantum computing, where resource costs typically skyrocket with target size. We explore efficient methods for generating photon states with tunable entanglement, providing a flexible tool for quantum state engineering. We introduce a theoretical framework that has been numerically validated, demonstrating the capacity to generate GHZ-like states incrementally from non-logical intermediate states. We demonstrate that in certain scenarios $-$ such as reducing the resource cost for building large maximally entangled GHZ states $-$ these variable-entanglement states can outperform their fixed-entanglement counterparts. By adjusting intermediate states and optimizing interferometer schemes, we improve photon number cost efficiency of GHZ-like states generation. Our findings indicate that while not a universal solution, non-maximally entangled states offer practical advantages for specific photonic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there exist a limited number of analytic potentials with the unusual property that any bound quantum state therein will be periodic in time. This is known as a perfect quantum state revival. Examples of such potentials are the infinite well, quantum harmonic oscillator and the P\"oschl-Teller potentials; here, we present a general method of designing such potentials. A key requirement is that their energy eigenvalues have integer spacings (up to a prefactor). We first analyze the required conditions which permit quantum state revivals for potentials in general, and then we use techniques of iterated Hamiltonian intertwining to construct potentials exhibiting perfect quantum revivals. Our method can readily be extended to multiple dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex optimization is the powerhouse behind the theory and practice of optimization. We introduce a quantum analogue of unconstrained convex optimization: computing the minimum eigenvalue of a Schr\"odinger operator $h = -\Delta + V $ with convex potential $V:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ such that $V(x)\rightarrow\infty $ as $\|x\|\rightarrow\infty$. For this problem, we present an efficient quantum algorithm, called the Fundamental Gap Algorithm (FGA), that computes the minimum eigenvalue of $h$ up to error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time in $n$, $1/\epsilon$, and parameters that depend on $V$. Adiabatic evolution of the ground state is used as a key subroutine, which we analyze with novel techniques that allow us to focus on the low-energy space. We apply the FGA to give the first known polynomial-time algorithm for finding the lowest frequency of an $n$-dimensional convex drum, or mathematically, the minimum eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an $n$-dimensional region that is defined by $m$ linear constraints in polynomial time in $n$, $m$, $1/\epsilon$ and the radius $R$ of a ball encompassing the region.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate whether Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) can provide a computational advantage for solving the planted biclique problem, which is a graph problem widely believed to be classically hard when the planted structure is small. Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to favor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically hard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic derived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS samples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this signal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background nodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS and quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal a sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal, making detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings provide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain computationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate further investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum approaches for this problem.</description>

      <title>Virus Spreading in Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum communication have enabled long-distance secure information transfer through quantum channels, giving rise to quantum networks with unique physical and statistical properties. However, as in classical networks, the propagation of viruses in these systems could have severe consequences. Here, we investigate the critical problem of virus spreading in quantum networks. We develop quantitative tools, particularly a modified nonlinear dynamical system model, for performing epidemiological analyses on quantum networks. Our results show that quantum networks tend to be more resilient to viral infections, exhibiting higher epidemic thresholds than classical networks with identical graph topologies. This apparent robustness, however, arises primarily from the sparser connectivity inherent to the quantum networks. When the comparison is made at a fixed average connectivity, classical and quantum networks display comparable epidemic thresholds. These findings provide key insights into the security and reliability of future large-scale quantum communication systems. Our work bridges the fields of quantum information science, network theory, and epidemiology, paving the way for future studies of quantum epidemiological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Architecting Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Computers using Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ion (TI) qubits are a leading quantum computing platform. Current TI systems have less than 60 qubits, but a modular architecture known as the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) is a promising path to scale up devices. There is a large gap between the error rates of near-term systems ($10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) and the requirements of practical applications (below $10^{-9}$). To bridge this gap, we require Quantum Error Correction (QEC) to build logical qubits that are composed of multiple physical qubits. While logical qubits have been demonstrated on TI qubits, these demonstrations are restricted to small codes and systems. There is no clarity on how QCCD systems should be designed to implement practical-scale QEC. This paper studies how surface codes, a standard QEC scheme, can be implemented efficiently on QCCD-based systems. To examine how architectural parameters of a QCCD system can be tuned for surface codes, we develop a near-optimal topology-aware compilation method that outperforms existing QCCD compilers by an average of 3.8X in terms of logical clock speed. We use this compiler to examine how hardware trap capacity, connectivity and electrode wiring choices can be optimised for surface code implementation. In particular, we demonstrate that small traps of two ions are surprisingly ideal from both a performance-optimal and hardware-efficiency standpoint. This result runs counter to prior intuition that larger traps (20-30 ions) would be preferable, and has the potential to inform design choices for upcoming systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Simulation of 50 Qubits on Europe`s First Exascale Supercomputer Harnessing Its Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a new version of the high-performance J\"ulich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</description>

      <title>Anomalous heat flow and quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Enumeration algorithms for combinatorial problems using Ising machines: When should we stop exploring energy landscapes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial problems such as combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems arise in decision-making across various fields of science and technology. In real-world applications, when multiple optimal or constraint-satisfying solutions exist, enumerating all these solutions is often desirable, as it provides flexibility in decision-making. However, combinatorial problems and their enumeration versions pose significant computational challenges due to combinatorial explosion. To address these challenges, we propose enumeration algorithms for combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems using Ising machines. Ising machines are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial problems by exploring the energy landscape of an Ising model. Ising machines typically sample lower-energy solutions with higher probability. Our enumeration algorithms repeatedly perform such sampling to collect all desirable solutions. The crux of the proposed algorithms lies in their stopping criteria for sampling-based energy landscape exploration, which are derived from probability theory. In particular, the proposed algorithms have theoretical guarantees that the failure probability of enumeration is bounded above by a user-specified value, provided that lower-cost solutions are sampled more frequently and equal-cost solutions are sampled with equal probability. Many physics-based Ising machines are expected to (approximately) satisfy these conditions. As a demonstration, we applied our algorithm using simulated annealing to maximum clique enumeration on random graphs. We found that our algorithm enumerates all maximum cliques in large, dense graphs faster than a conventional branch-and-bound algorithm specifically designed for maximum clique enumeration. These findings underscore the effectiveness and potential of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Kitaev model in regular hyperbolic tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolate between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of an optical microcavity consisting in the plane-plane arrangement of two suspended resonant mirrors possessing spectrally overlapping high-quality factor internal resonances. We first investigate its generic transmission spectra as the cavity length is varied on the basis of a simple linear Fabry-Perot model, compare them with those of broadband mirror cavities or Fano cavities possessing a single resoannt mirror, and then present an experimental realization using a pair of highly pretensioned, ultrathin silicon nitride films patterned with one-dimensional photonic crystal structures.</description>
