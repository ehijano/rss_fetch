      <title>In-Silico Investigation of 3D Quantitative Angiography for Internal Carotid Aneurysms Using Biplane Imaging and 3D Vascular Geometry Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative angiography (QA) in two dimensions has been instrumental in assessing neurovascular contrast flow patterns, aiding disease severity and treatment outcome evaluations. However, QA requires high spatio-temporal resolution, restricting its use to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and is prone to errors in quantification of highly 3D flow patterns. This study examines whether 3D QA information can be recovered by reconstructing four-dimensional (4D) angiography using data from standard clinical imaging protocols. Patient-specific internal carotid aneurysm models were used to generate high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of contrast flow. The resulting 4D angiograms were used to simulate biplane DSA under clinical imaging protocols. 4D angiography was reconstructed from two views using back-projection constrained by an a priori 3D geometry. Quantitative angiographic parametric imaging (API) metrics obtained from the CFD-based 4D angiography and reconstructed 4D angiography were compared using mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The reconstructed 4D datasets effectively captured 3D flow dynamics, achieving an average MSE of 0.007 across models and flow conditions. API metrics such as PH and AUC closely matched the CFD ground truth, with temporal metrics showing some variability in regions with overlapping projections. These results demonstrate the potential to recover 3D QA information using simulated 4D angiography constrained by standard clinical imaging parameters. The method provides a robust framework for evaluating and improving QA in clinical neurovascular applications, offering new insights into the dynamics of aneurysmal contrast flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Computed Tomography Angiography for Cerebral Vessel Templates and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is crucial for cerebrovascular disease diagnosis. Dynamic CTA is a type of imaging that captures temporal information about the We aim to develop and evaluate two segmentation techniques to segment vessels directly on CTA images: (1) creating and registering population-averaged vessel atlases and (2) using deep learning (DL). Methods: We retrieved 4D-CT of the head from our institutional research database, with bone and soft tissue subtracted from post-contrast images. An Advanced Normalization Tools pipeline was used to create angiographic atlases from 25 patients. Then, atlas-driven ROIs were identified by a CT attenuation threshold to generate segmentation of the arteries and veins using non-linear registration. To create DL vessel segmentations, arterial and venous structures were segmented using the MRA vessel segmentation tool, iCafe, in 29 patients. These were then used to train a DL model, with bone-in CT images as input. Multiple phase images in the 4D-CT were used to increase the training and validation dataset. Both segmentation approaches were evaluated on a test 4D-CT dataset of 11 patients which were also processed by iCafe and validated by a neuroradiologist. Specifically, branch-wise segmentation accuracy was quantified with 20 labels for arteries and one for veins. DL outperformed the atlas-based segmentation models for arteries (average modified dice coefficient (amDC) 0.856 vs. 0.324) and veins (amDC 0.743 vs. 0.495) overall. For ICAs, vertebral and basilar arteries, DL and atlas -based segmentation had an amDC of 0.913 and 0.402, respectively. The amDC for MCA-M1, PCA-P1, and ACA-A1 segments were 0.932 and 0.474, respectively. Conclusion: Angiographic CT templates are developed for the first time in literature. Using 4D-CTA enables the use of tools like iCafe, lessening the burden of manual annotation.</description>

      <title>Offset geometry for extended field-of-view in multi-contrast and multi-scale X-ray microtomography of lung cancer lobectomy specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography is a powerful non-destructive technique allowing 3D virtual histology of resected human tissue. The achievable imaging field-of-view, is however limited by the fixed number of detector elements, enforcing the requirement to sacrifice spatial resolution in order to image larger samples. In applications such as soft-tissue imaging, phase-contrast methods are often employed to enhance image contrast. Some of these methods, especially those suited to laboratory sources, rely on optical elements, the dimensions of which can impose a further limitation on the field-of-view. We describe an efficient method to double the maximum field-of-view of a cone-beam X-ray microtomography system, without sacrificing on spatial resolution, and including multi-contrast capabilities. We demonstrate an experimental realisation of the method, achieving exemplary reconstructions of a resected human lung sample, with a cubic voxel of 10.5 $\mu$m linear dimensions, across a horizontal field-of-view of 4.3 cm. The same concepts are applied to free-space propagation imaging of a 2.7 mm segment of the same sample, achieving a cubic voxel of 450 nm linear dimensions. We show that the methodology can be applied at a range of different length-scales and geometries, and that it is directly compatible with complementary implementations of X-ray phase-contrast imaging.</description>
