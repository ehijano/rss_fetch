      <title>Pressure-robust enriched Galerkin finite element methods for coupled Navier-Stokes and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pressure-robust enriched Galerkin (EG) finite element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes and heat equations in the Boussinesq regime. For the Navier-Stokes equations, the EG formulation combines continuous Lagrange elements with a discontinuous enrichment vector per element in the velocity space and a piecewise constant pressure space, and it can be implemented efficiently within standard finite element frameworks. To enforce pressure robustness, we construct velocity reconstruction operators that map the discrete EG velocity field into exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming fields. In particular, we develop reconstructions based on Arbogast-Correa (AC) mixed finite element spaces on quadrilateral meshes and demonstrate that the resulting schemes remain stable and accurate even on highly distorted grids. The nonlinearity of the coupled Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system is treated with several iterative strategies, including Picard iterations and Anderson-accelerated iterations; our numerical study shows that Anderson acceleration yields robust and efficient convergence for high Rayleigh number flows within the proposed framework. The performance of the method is assessed on a set of benchmark problems and application-driven test cases. These numerical experiments highlight the potential of pressure-robust EG methods as flexible and accurate tools for coupled flow and heat transport in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic optimization of a heat-pipe microreactor, part I: theory and cost optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microreactors, particularly heat-pipe microreactors (HPMRs), are compact, transportable, self-regulated power systems well-suited for access-challenged remote areas where costly fossil fuels dominate. However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.</description>

      <title>CauSTream: Causal Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Streamflow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>FinAudio: A Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models in Financial Applications</title>

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Polycrystalline Material Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional polycrystal foundation model based on a masked autoencoder that learns intrinsic microstructural representations through large-scale self-supervised pretraining on voxel-based data. The pretraining dataset consists of 100,000 face-centered cubic (FCC) microstructures whose crystallographic textures span the texture hull via hierarchical simplex sampling. The quality and transferability of the learned representations are evaluated through two downstream tasks: (i) homogenized stiffness prediction and (ii) nonlinear homogenized response prediction. In the latter, the pretrained encoder is coupled with an orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network (ODMN), where the learned latent representations are used to infer microstructure-dependent ODMN parameters. This enables accurate stress-strain predictions for previously unseen microstructures under crystal plasticity. Across both tasks, the pretrained encoder consistently exhibits superior generalization performance compared to non-pretrained baselines. These results demonstrate the strong transferability of the proposed foundation model and its effectiveness in data-scarce scientific settings with limited labeled microstructures. The framework further enables scalable integration with experimentally derived microstructures, providing a practical basis for microstructure-property reasoning in materials design.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Predictions of Process-Induced Deformation in Carbon/Epoxy Composites Using a Deep Operator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber reinforcement and polymer matrix respond differently to manufacturing conditions due to mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion and matrix shrinkage during curing of thermosets. These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.</description>

      <title>A Data-Enhanced Agent-Based Model for Simulating 3D Cancer Spheroid Growth: Integrating Metabolism and Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer research has shifted from a purely gene-centric view to a more holistic understanding that recognizes the critical role of the tumour microenvironment, where mechanics and metabolism are key drivers of disease progression. However, the intricate interplay between these multifactorial mechanisms remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present an agent-based computational model (ABM) that integrates tumour metabolism and mechanics to study 3D cancer spheroid growth. Our approach unifies the metabolism and mechanical aspects of tumour development within an integral model for cancer spheroid formation and growth. In addition to that, we performed a computational calibration of the parameters and tested the model versatility to reproduce different cellular behaviours. Our model reproduced qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results of spheroid growth obtained in the lab and also allowed to discern different dynamics that cancer cells can present under the same conditions, providing insight into the potential factors contributing to the variability in the size of spheroids. Furthermore, it also showed its adaptability to reproduce diferent cell lines and behaviours by tuning its parameters. This study highlights the significant potential and versatility of integrative modelling approaches in the field of cancer research, not only as a tool to complement in vitro studies, but also as independent tools to derive conclusions from the physical reality.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.
