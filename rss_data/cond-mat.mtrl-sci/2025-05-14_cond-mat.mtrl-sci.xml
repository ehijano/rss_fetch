      <title>Estimation of oil recovery due to wettability changes in carbonate reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) enhances oil recovery at low cost in carbonate reservoirs, but its effectiveness requires precise control of injected water chemistry and interaction with reservoir minerals. This study develops an integrated reactive transport model coupling geochemical surface complexation modeling (SCM) with multiphase compositional dynamics to quantify wettability alteration during LSWF. The framework combines PHREEQC-based equilibrium calculations of the Total Bond Product (TBP), a wettability indicator derived from oil-calcite ionic bridging, with Corey-type relative permeability interpolation, resolved via COMSOL Multiphysics. Core flooding simulations, compared with experimental data from calcite systems at 100 degrees Celsius and 220 bar, reveal that magnesium and sulfate concentrations modulate TBP, reducing oil-rock adhesion under controlled low-salinity conditions. Parametric analysis demonstrates that acidic crude oils (TAN higher than 1 mg KOH per gram) exhibit TBP values approximately 2.5 times higher than sweet crudes, due to carboxylate-calcite bridging, while pH elevation (above 7.5) amplifies wettability shifts by promoting deprotonated carboxyl interactions. The model further identifies synergistic effects between magnesium (50 to 200 millimoles per kilogram of water) and sulfate (above 500 millimoles per kilogram of water), which reduce calcium-mediated oil adhesion through competitive mineral surface binding. By correlating TBP with fractional flow dynamics, this framework could support the optimization of injection strategies in carbonate reservoirs, suggesting that ion-specific adjustments are more effective than bulk salinity reduction.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning applied to the identification of high-pressure elusive phases from spatially resolved X-ray diffraction large datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-technique high resolution X-ray mapping enhanced by the recent advent of 4th generation synchrotron facilities can produce colossal datasets, challenging traditional analysis methods. Such difficulty is clearly materialized when probing crystal structure of inhomogeneous samples, where the number of diffraction patterns quickly increases with map resolution, making the identification of crystal phases within a vast collection of reflections unfeasibly challenging by direct human inspection. Here we develop a novel analysis approach based on unsupervised clustering algorithms for identifying independent phases within a diffraction spatial map, which allowed us to identify the material distribution across a high-pressure cerium hydride. By investigating the specific compound, we also contribute to the understanding of synthesis inhomogeneities among the superhydrides, a prominent superconductor class in condensed matter physics whose characterization is highly challenging even for state-of-the-art materials techniques. The analysis framework we present may be readily extended to any correlated set of curves whose features are tied to specific entities, such as structural phases.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Selective Epitaxy of Rare-Earth Diantimonides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic control of the layering configuration of two-dimensional quantum materials plays a central role in studying their emergent electronic properties. Here we demonstrate in-situ control over competing stacking configurations in thin film crystals of the rare-earth diantimonides by synthesizing in proximity to competing structural orders. A crossover between the epitaxially stabilized monoclinic structure and the orthorhombic structure commonly observed in bulk crystals is navigated through three axes; the relative cation/anion ratio, growth temperature, and choice of lanthanide ion, culminating with a comparative magnetotransport study of single-yet-distinct phase CeSb2 films. These results set the stage for an expanded search for hidden stacking configurations in layered compounds which have evaded detection.</description>

      <title>Tuning the magnetic properties of spin-split antiferromagnet MnTe through pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal antiferromagnet MnTe has attracted enormous interest as a prototypical example of a spin-compensated magnet in which the combination of crystal and spin symmetries lifts the spin degeneracy of the electron bands without the need for spin-orbit coupling, a phenomenon called non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS). Subgroups of NRSS are determined by the specific spin-interconverting symmetry that connects the two opposite-spin sublattices. In MnTe, this symmetry is rotation, leading to the subgroup with spin splitting away from the Brillouin zone center, often called altermagnetism. MnTe also has the largest spontaneous magnetovolume effect of any known antiferromagnet, implying strong coupling between the magnetic moment and volume. This magnetostructural coupling offers a potential knob for tuning the spin-splitting properties of MnTe. Here, we use neutron diffraction with $\textit{in situ}$ applied pressure to determine the effects of pressure on the magnetic properties of MnTe and further explore this magnetostructural coupling. We find that applying pressure significantly increases the N\'eel temperature but decreases the ordered magnetic moment. We explain this as a consequence of strengthened magnetic exchange interactions under pressure, resulting in higher $T_\mathrm{N}$, with a simultaneous reduction of the local moment of individual Mn atoms, described here via density functional theory. This reflects the increased orbital hybridization and electron delocalization with pressure. These results show that the magnetic properties of MnTe can be controlled by pressure, opening the door to improved properties for spintronic applications through tuning via physical or chemical pressure.</description>

      <title>Composition-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties of Hybrid Tin Perovskites (CH3NH3)xCs1-xSnI3: Insights into Electrical and Thermal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the thermoelectric properties of bulk hybrid perovskites with the general formula MAxCs1-xSnI3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). A series of bulk samples were synthesized and systematically characterized to explore the relationship between composition, microstructure, and thermoelectric performance. Compositions with intermediate MA+ content (x = 0.2 and x = 0.5) show an optimal balance between electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, yielding high power factor values (0.6 - 0.7 muW/cmK2 at 423 K) and favorable thermoelectric performance with zT values up to 0.06. In contrast, compositions with MA+ contents (x = 0, x = 0.6, and x = 0.8) exhibit lower thermoelectric performance due to reduced Seebeck coefficients or suppressed conductivity. MASnI3 shows promising low-temperature thermoelectric performance with a maximum $zT$ of 0.10 at 423 K, attributed to its rapidly increasing Seebeck coefficient. These findings highlight the importance of microstructural control and composition optimization in the development of hybrid perovskites for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Modulated Electrical Switching in an Antiferromagnetic Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin version of transistor, where magnetism is used to influence electrical behaviors of the semiconductor, has been a long-pursued device concept in spintronics. In this work, we experimentally study a field-effect transistor with CrSBr, a van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic semiconductor, as the channel material. Unlike the weak magnetic tunability of in-plane currents previously reported in vdW magnets, the channel current of our transistor is efficiently tuned by both gate voltage and magnetic transitions, achieving a magnetoresistance ratio as high as 1500%. Combining measurement and theoretical modeling, we reveal magnetically modulated carrier concentration as the origin of the large magnetoresistance. The strategy of using both magnetic ordering and electric field in the same device to control ON/OFF states of a transistor opens a new avenue of energy-efficient spintronics for memory, logic and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization switching in sliding ferroelectrics: the roles of fluctuation and domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is highly attractive for its low energy barriers and fatigue resistance. As the origin of these exotic properties, its unconventional switching dynamics remains poorly understood: how an electric field drives a perpendicular sliding? Taking $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, its switching dynamics is studied using \textit{ab initio} calculations. The off-diagonal Born effective charge leads to the perpendicular relationship between the electric field and ionic movements. Interestingly, the rules of intrinsic coercive field are distinct between $h$-BN bilayer and conventional ferroelectrics. For $h$-BN bilayer, any perturbation breaking the in-plane symmetry plays a key role to assist the avalanche-like switching dynamics. Moreover, the exotic large off-diagonal Born effective charge near the $P=0$ intermediate state results in a wriggling motion of domain walls in $h$-BN bilayer. Our results reveal the key factors in the ferroelectric switching of sliding ferroelectrics at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Extended Dynamical Kubo-Toyabe Relaxation for $\mu$SR study of Ion Dynamics: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the analysis of the ion diffusion in metal oxides based on muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), the dynamical Kubo-Toyabe (dKT) function has been routinely used to deduce the jump frequency of ions. This is based on the two beliefs: (1) the fluctuations of the internal magnetic field ${\bm H}(t)$ are determined solely by the relative motion of the muons to the surrounding ions, and (2) the muons are immobile due to bonding to the oxygen. However, these are not necessarily trivial, and we addressed their credibility by developing an extended dKT function corresponding to the realistic situation that only a part of the ions surrounding muon are involved in a single fluctuation of ${\bm H}(t)$ in the ion diffusion, and investigated its behavior in detail. The results show that the new function exhibits qualitatively different behavior from the dKT function, and that it provides a way to determine whether muons or ions are in motion, as well as a means for quantitative analysis based on the assumption of immobile muons. As a typical example, we examine the earlier $\mu^\pm$SR results on Na$_x$CoO$_2$ and demonstrate that the internal field fluctuations observed in $\mu^+$SR are dominated by muon self-diffusion, in contrast to previous interpretations.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Experiment in Materials Discovery: Machine-Learning-Assisted Prediction of Synthesizable Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though thermodynamic energy-based crystal structure prediction (CSP) has revolutionized materials discovery, the energy-driven CSP approaches often struggle to identify experimentally realizable metastable materials synthesized through kinetically controlled pathways, creating a critical gap between theoretical predictions and experimental synthesis. Here, we propose a synthesizability-driven CSP framework that integrates symmetry-guided structure derivation with a Wyckoff encode-based machine-learning model, allowing for the efficient localization of subspaces likely to yield highly synthesizable structures. Within the identified promising subspaces, a structure-based synthesizability evaluation model, fine-tuned using recently synthesized structures to enhance predictive accuracy, is employed in conjunction with ab initio calculations to systematically identify synthesizable candidates. The framework successfully reproduces 13 experimentally known XSe (X = Sc, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) structures, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting synthesizable structures. Notably, 92,310 structures are filtered from the 554,054 candidates predicted by GNoME, exhibiting great potential for promising synthesizability. Additionally, eight thermodynamically favorable Hf-X-O (X = Ti, V, and Mn) structures have been identified, among which three HfV$_2$O$_7$ candidates exhibit high synthesizability, presenting viable candidates for experimental realization and potentially associated with experimentally observed temperature-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a data-driven paradigm for machine-learning-assisted inorganic materials synthesis, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between computational predictions and experimental realization while unlocking new opportunities for the targeted discovery of novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction-Free Approach for Predicting Nonlinear Responses in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Study of magneto-thermal resistance effect in a Co50Fe50/Cu multilayer through the analysis of electron and lattice thermal conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the giant magneto-thermal resistance (GMTR) effect in a fully-bcc epitaxial Co50Fe50/Cu multilayer through both experimental and theoretical approaches. The applied magnetic field results in a giant change of the cross-plane thermal conductivity ({\Delta}\k{appa}) of 37 W m-1 K-1, which reaches 1.5 times larger than the previously reported value for a magnetic multilayer and record the highest value at room temperature among the other solid-state thermal switching materials working on different principles. We investigated the electron thermal conductivity for exploring the remarkable {\Delta}\k{appa} by the two-current-series-resistor model combined with the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. However, the result shows the electron contribution accounts for only 35% of the {\Delta}\k{appa}, indicating the presence of additional spin-dependent heat carriers. Further investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity, which is expected to be spin-independent, using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations suggests a striking contrast: the additional spin-dependent heat carrier contribution is significantly enhanced in the parallel magnetization configuration but nearly negligible in the antiparallel configuration. These findings provide a fundamental insight into the origin of large GMTR effect and highlight its potential of active thermal management technologies for future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow-AL: Active Learning-based Workflow for Inverse Design of Functional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing inverse design methods for functional materials with specific properties is critical to advancing fields like renewable energy, catalysis, energy storage, and carbon capture. Generative models based on diffusion principles can directly produce new materials that meet performance constraints, thereby significantly accelerating the material design process. However, existing methods for generating and predicting crystal structures often remain limited by low success rates. In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 {\AA}, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL. As a result, we successfully identified Li\(_2\)AuH\(_6\) as a conventional BCS superconductor with an ultra-high transition temperature of 140 K. This discovery provides strong empirical support for the application of inverse design in materials science.</description>

      <title>Harnessing self-sensitized scintillation by supramolecular engineering of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in dense mesoporous template nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite-based nanoscintillators, such as CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs), are emerging as promising candidates for ionizing radiation detection, thanks to their high emission efficiency, rapid response, and facile synthesis. However, their nanoscale dimensions - smaller than the mean free path of secondary carriers - and relatively low emitter density per unit volume, limited by their high molecular weight and reabsorption losses, restrict efficient secondary carrier conversion and hamper their practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a strategy to enhance scintillation performance by organizing NCs into densely packed domains within porous SiO2 mesospheres (MSNs). This engineered architecture achieves up to a 40-fold increase in radioluminescence intensity compared to colloidal NCs, driven by improved retention and conversion of secondary charges, as corroborated by electron release measurements. This approach offers a promising pathway toward developing next-generation nanoscintillators with enhanced performance, with potential applications in high-energy physics, medical imaging, and space technologies.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on electron- and magnon-mediated torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for artificial intelligence and complex computing has underscored the urgent need for advanced data storage technologies. Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a leading candidate for high-speed, high-density magnetic random-access memory due to its ultrafast switching speed and low power consumption. This review systematically explores the generation and switching mechanisms of electron-mediated torques (including both conventional SOTs and orbital torques) and magnon-mediated torques. We discuss key materials that enable these effects: heavy metals, topological insulators, low-crystal-symmetry materials, non-collinear antiferromagnets, and altermagnets for conventional SOTs; 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals for orbital torques; and antiferromagnetic insulator NiO- and multiferroic BiFeO3-based sandwich structures for magnon torques. We emphasize that although key components of SOT devices have been demonstrated, numerous promising materials and critical questions regarding their underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Therefore, this field represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving frontier in spintronics, offering significant potential for advancing next-generation information storage and computational technologies.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic properties and performance optimization for photovoltaic applications of R3m-RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites: A combined DFT and SCAPS-1D study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of an all-inorganic non-toxic perovskite solar cell (PSC) with enhanced performance, we have investigated the rhombohedral phase of the germanium-based rubidium halide perovskites RbGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). The structural analysis followed by an in-depth study of the electronic and optical properties of these materials is performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). A detailed investigation of the electronic properties is carried out by examining the band structure and partial density of states (PDOS). PBE and TB-mBJ exchange-correlation functionals are used with and without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), thereby obtaining accurate predictions of the band gaps. The key optical properties such as the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, absorption coefficient and refractive index are studied using PBE functional and compared among the three halides. RbGeI$_3$ exhibits the lowest band gap of 0.96 eV with the TB-mBJ + SOC functional, along with the most favorable optical properties, hence, it was identified as the most suitable candidate for the absorber layer (AL) of the PSC. SCAPS-1D simulation is performed using various input parameters for the AL such as the band gap, the effective densities of states for the conduction and valence bands and the electron and hole mobilities extracted from the DFT calculation. Performance optimization is done by exploring the impact of different inorganic hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs). The impact of different layer thicknesses, doping densities, defect densities at the AL, ETL/AL, and AL/HTL interfaces, various back contacts, and the influence of series and shunt resistance on the overall device performance are studied. The optimized all-inorganic device demonstrated a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of $25.76\%$ with a fill factor (FF) of $79.81\%$.</description>

      <title>Imaging domain boundaries of rubrene thin crystallites by photoemission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress of designing organic semiconductors is extensively dependent on the quality of prepared organic molecular assemblies, since the charge transport mechanism is strongly efficient in highly ordered crystals compared to amorphous domains. Here we present a comprehensive photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopic study of rubrene ($\mathrm{C}_{48}\mathrm{H}_{24}$) thin crystals focusing on recently developed orthorhombic crystalline morphologies applied in organic electronic devices. Using femtosecond pulsed lasers with photon energies between 3-6 eV, we explore the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states. In a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), the PEEM images reveal dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation uniform emission across the crystal surface is observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms. Furthermore, in the intermediate photon energy range, we identify a nonlinear, non-integer photon order, where mostly the triclinic morphology contributes to the emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A unified bonding entropy model to determine magnetic properties in graphene nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) exhibit rich magnetic behaviors arising from two primary mechanisms: geometry frustration in non-Kekul\'e structures and electron delocalization-driven aromatic stabilization in Kekul\'e-type systems. Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekul\'e systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekul\'e-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>The meaning of Li diffusion in cathode materials for the cycling of Li-ion batteries: A case study on LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that for polycrystalline LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 c-axis textured thin film cathodes of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the kinetics of Li storage and release including maximum specific capacity is determined by Li diffusion. The C-rate capability and long-term cycling behavior were investigated. The films exhibited up to 30% of the expected practical capacity even at low C-rates. However, 100% capacity was achieved at very low cycling rates below 0.01C. The capacity showed a reversible behaviour with changing current density, indicating no film degradation. The C-rate capability experiment showed a square root dependence of capacities on current density, which corresponds to a diffusion-controlled process. The estimated diffusivities from the cycling experiments are independent of the current density. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities were measured using standard electrochemical and non-electrochemical diffusion measurement techniques. Chemical diffusivities, thermodynamic factor, and hence Li tracer diffusivities were determined from potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments as a function of electrode potential and state of charge (SOC). The diffusivities were found to be approximately independent of potential, SOC and cycle number. The Li tracer diffusivities were validated by 6Li tracer diffusion experiments with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The diffusivities obtained by PITT and SIMS were found to be more reliable for Li uptake and release than those obtained by EIS. Based on the diffusion results, a C-rate limit for full film delithiation below 0.01 C was calculated due to slow Li diffusion.</description>

      <title>Using Dopants as Agents to Probe Key Electronic Properties of Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In organic electronics, conductivity doping is used primarily to eliminate charge injection barriers in organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and other electronic devices. Therefore, research on conductivity doping is primarily focused on understanding and enhancing the properties of these doped layers. In contrast, this work shifts the focus from optimizing doped layers to leveraging the doping process as a tool for investigating fundamental material properties. Specifically, the dopant is used as an "agent" to enable the measurement of three critical parameters: ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and Coulomb interaction energy (VC) - that govern dopant ionization and play central roles in organic electronic devices in general. While these parameters can be measured experimentally, conventional approaches often involve intricate or indirect methods, such as spectral deconvolution, which may introduce ambiguities or fail to represent bulk properties. Here it is shown how consolidating the experimental data and simulations on the dopant ionization fraction and doped-induced conductivity can be used to estimate the mean IP or EA of the embedded organic molecule, and VC of the embedded charge-transfer complex. These results illustrate how measuring and simulating doped materials can provide access to the fundamental design parameters of organic electronic devices</description>

      <title>Natural layered phlogopite dielectric for ultrathin two-dimensional optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of high-dielectric-constant (high-$\kappa$) materials with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is promising to overcome performance limitations and reach their full theoretical potential. Here we show that naturally occurring phlogopite mica, exfoliated into ultrathin flakes, can serve as a robust high-$\kappa$ dielectric layer for transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D electronics and optoelectronics. Phlogopite's wide bandgap (~4.8 eV), high dielectric constant (~11), and large breakdown field (10 MVcm$^{-1}$) enable transistors with subthreshold swings down to 100 mVdec$^{-1}$, minimal hysteresis (30-60 mV) and interface trap densities comparable to state-of-the-art oxide dielectrics. Moreover, phototransistors built upon monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and phlogopite exhibit responsivities up to 3.3x10$^{4}$ AW$^{-1}$ and detectivities near 10$^{10}$ Jones, surpassing devices based on conventional gate insulators. We further demonstrate the versatility of this natural dielectric by integrating phlogopite/MoS$_2$ heterostructures into NMOS inverters, showcasing robust voltage gains and low-voltage operation. Our findings establish phlogopite as a promising, earth-abundant dielectric for next-generation 2D transistor technologies and high-performance photodetection.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetic glassiness in non-centrosymmetric Sm$_7$Pd$_3$: Interplay of magnetic frustration, long-range order, and frozen domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the intricate spin dynamics in the non-centrosymmetric compound Sm$_7$Pd$_3$, revealing the coexistence of spin glass, domain glass, and ferromagnetic (FM) behaviors. Magnetic field-dependent measurements indicate large coercivity, suggesting ferromagnetic domain formation below the Curie temperature ($T_C \sim 173$ K), while temperature-dependent magnetization data point to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling, highlighting the competition between FM and AFM interactions. Detailed ac susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization, and aging effect measurements demonstrate the presence of two distinct types of glassiness in the sample, and their possible origins are discussed extensively. Magnetization measurements reveal the mixing of the J = 5/2 ground state of Sm$^{3+}$ with the excited J = 7/2 multiplet, lying 965 K above. The specific heat data show further crystalline electric field splitting of the J = 5/2 state into a ground-state doublet and a fourfold-degenerate excited state.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Scale-Free Phase-Field Studies of $\alpha$ to $\omega$ Phase Transformation in Single Crystal Zirconium under Nonhydrostatic Loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zirconium (Zr) is an important engineering material with numerous practical applications. It undergoes martensitic $\alpha$ to $\omega$ phase transformation (PT) at pressures that vary from 0.67 GPa to 17 GPa under different loading conditions. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the effect of the nonhydrostatic stresses is not well understood. To separate the effect of nonhydrostatic stresses from the plastic deformation, a scale-free phase field approach (PFA) for multivariant $\alpha$ to $\omega$ PT in a single crystal Zr under general nonhydrostatic loadings is presented. Explicit conditions for the direct and reverse PTs between austenite and martensitic variants and between martensitic variants under general stress tensor are derived and analyzed. In particular, the effect of the deviatoric stresses on the PT pressures is elucidated. It is shown that their effect cannot explain much larger reduction in the transformation pressure observed during plastic flow, i.e., specific mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformations should be involved. Under assumption of the homogeneous fields in the sample, complete analytical solutions that include stress-strain curves during the PT, PT start and finish stresses (i.e., stress hysteresis), and volume fraction of the variants, are determined for different loadings. Finite element method (FEM) solutions are found for the phase field simulations of the microstructure evolution for the same loadings, as well as for two grains of the polycrystalline sample. Macroscopic averaged characteristics of the PFA solutions are well described by an analytical solution, which also simplifies their interpretations. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with existing experiments. In addition, some controversies of the previous approaches are analysed.</description>

      <title>Al$_2$MnCu: A magnetically ordered member of the Heusler alloy family despite having a valence electron count of 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic property of the Heusler alloys can be predicted by the famous Slater-Pauling (S-P) rule, which states the total magnetic moment ($m_t$) of such materials can be expressed as $m _t\,=\,(N_V-24)\,\mu_B/f.u.$, where $N_V$ is the total valence electron count (VEC). Consequently, no Heusler alloys having VEC = 24 are theoretically expected as well as experimentally reported to have any magnetic ordering. Recently, a special class of Heusler alloys with 50\% concentration of $p$-block elements (anti-Heusler) have been identified, although none of such reported compounds belong to the VEC 24 category. Here, we report a new anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnCu, that undergoes long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering with $T_{\rm C}\sim$315 K and a large magnetic moment of $\sim$1.8 $\mu_B$/f.u. despite having VEC 24. A phenomenological model based on molecular orbital hybridization is also proposed to understand the magnetism and unusual deviation from the standard S-P rule.</description>

      <title>Three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustics in ferromagnetic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of magnonic devices requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to excite spin waves resonantly with magneto-elastic wave formation or to drive non-resonantly forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavevpackets enable another resonant interaction regime - Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This poses a question on the criteria and signatures of transitions between these three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustic. Here, we use the scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly reveal all three regimes of interactions of laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wave packets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide on top of a (011)-Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities revealed the transition from coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and non-resonant regime controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. Acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.</description>

Abstract: This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials</title>

Abstract: The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance of Highly Activated Carbon and Surface-Treated Porous Polymers as Physical Adsorbents for Chemical Warfare Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in modern warfare cannot be disregarded due to their ease of use and potential for large-scale incapacitation. An effective countermeasure involves the physical adsorption of these agents, preventing their entry through the respiratory tract by non-specific adsorption. In this study, we investigate the physical interaction between potential adsorbents and model gases mimicking CWAs, thereby identifying sufficient conditions for higher physical adsorption performance. Our findings reveal that the physical adsorption capacity is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the adsorbents, with uniform development of micropores, rather than solely high surface area, emerging as a critical factor. Additionally, we identified the potential of porous organic polymers as promising alternatives to conventional activated carbon-based adsorbents. Through a facile introduction of polar sulfone functional groups on the polymer surface, we demonstrated that these polar surface polymers exhibit physical adsorption capabilities for formaldehyde under ambient conditions comparable to high-performance activated carbons. Notably, the superior activated carbon possessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform micropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms. This research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical adsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant advancement in developing next-generation protective materials.</description>

      <title>Total Variation-Based Image Decomposition and Denoising for Microscopy Images</title>

Abstract: Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM, AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Screening of the Mechanical Properties of Peptide Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peptides are recognized for their varied self-assembly behaviors, forming a wide array of structures and geometries, such as spheres, fibers, and hydrogels, each presenting a unique set of material properties. The functionalities of these materials hold exceptional interest for applications in biology, medicine, photonics, nanotechnology and the food industry. In specific, the ability to exploit peptides as viable and sustainable mechanical materials requires sequence design that enables superior performance, notably a high Young's modulus. As the peptide sequence space is vast, however, even a slight increase in sequence length leads to an exponential increase in the number of potential peptide sequences to be characterized. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy experiments and machine learning models to correlate the sequence length and composition with the mechanical properties of self-assembled peptides. We calculate the Young's modulus for all possible amino acid sequences of di- and tripeptides using high-throughput coarse-grained methods, and validate these calculations through in-situ mechanical characterization. For pentapeptides, we select and calculate properties for a subset of sequences to train a machine learning model, which allows us to predict the modulus for other sequences. The combined workflow not only identifies promising peptide candidates with exceptional mechanical performances, but also extends current understanding of the sequence-to-function relationships for peptide materials, for specific applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the Migdal effect in a solid crystal is entirely due to non-adiabatic effects, namely the deviation of the wave function from exact factorization of the electronic and nuclear contributions. The matrix element obtained this way matches exactly the result found by means of a previously derived low energy effective theory.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flat band with zero Chern number, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we present a numerical study to demonstrate the emergence of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such isolated flat band with zero Chern number, which is hosted by a fluxed dice lattice with anisotropic hopping strength. While being topologically trivial, this flat band features an intriguing quantum geometry: the difference between the trace of quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature is a constant. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure that the isolated band limit is always satisfied, where band renormalization by interaction leaves the flat band quantum geometry unchanged and introduce a tiny band width only. At $2/3$ filling of the isolated flat band, our exact diagonalization calculations show unambiguous evidences for the FCI states, both from the many-body spectra and the many-body Chern number that demonstrates a fractionally quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/3h$. And the 3-fold ground state degeneracy on torus suggests that band-folding Hall crystal scenario is not compatible with the observed $1/3$ quantized Hall conductance at $2/3$ filling. We find the finite dispersion acquired from interaction renormalization, albeit tiny in the isolated band limit, is necessary for FCI to emerge. With anisotropy getting stronger towards the disconnected-chains limit, the FCI undergoes a topological phase transition to inter-chain charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for Perovskite Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design. However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes (QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex, which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for predictive modeling of perovskite materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems with high Chern number ($|C|&gt;1$) are rare. This Letter introduces a Haldane-graphene multilayer heterostructure hosting QAH states with arbitrary Chern number. In a rhombohedral-stacked graphene $N$-layer, the Dirac points at $K_{\pm}$ become $N^\text{th}$-order zeros of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. When an extra layer of Haldane model is stacked on top of the multilayer, the high-order Dirac points are gapped out and the heterostructure enters QAH phases with $|C|=N+1$. Therefore, gapping out high-order Dirac points paves a new way to high Chern number QAH states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS$_2$) and Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS$_2$/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS$_2$ and the effective spin current density.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet interband plasmonics down to the vacuum UV with ultrathin amorphous silicon nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from surface plasmonic to epsilon-near-zero plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of 3D superinsulation in a nanopatterned slab of NbTiN, given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the conductance when approaching the critical temperature from above and by the vanishing of the conductance below the transition. In the electric Meissner state, we find polar nematic order arising from ferroelectric alignement of short electric strings excited by external electromagnetic fields. Our results prove that superinsulation appears also in ordered structures provided that these are large enough, thereby confirming the origin of superinsulation as electric confinement, independent of disorder.</description>

Abstract: Triangulenes are prototypical examples of open-shell nanographenes. Their magnetic properties, arising from the presence of unpaired $\pi$ electrons, can be extensively tuned by modifying their size and shape or by introducing heteroatoms. Different triangulene derivatives have been designed and synthesized in recent years, thanks to the development of on-surface synthesis strategies. Triangulene-based nanostructures with polyradical character, hosting several interacting spin units, can be challenging to fabricate but are particularly interesting for potential applications in carbon-based spintronics. Here, we combine pristine and N-doped triangulenes into a more complex nanographene, \textbf{TTAT}, predicted to possess three unpaired $\pi$ electrons delocalized along the zigzag periphery. We generate the molecule on an Au(111) surface and detect direct fingerprints of multi-radical coupling and high-spin state using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. With the support of theoretical calculations, we show that its three radical units are localized at distinct parts of the molecule and couple via symmetric ferromagnetic interactions, which result in a $S=3/2$ ground state, thus demonstrating the realization of a molecular ferromagnetic Heisenberg-like spin trimer</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3</title>

Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Multislice Electron Ptychography to Point Defects: A Case Study in SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we evaluate multislice electron ptychography as a tool to carry out depth-resolved atomic resolution characterization of point defects, using silicon carbide as a case study. Through multislice electron scattering simulations and multislice ptychographic reconstructions, we investigate the phase contrast arising from individual silicon vacancies, antisite defects, and a wide range of substitutional transition metal dopants (V\textsubscript{Si} to W\textsubscript{Si}) and potential detectability. Simulating defect types, positions, and microscope conditions, we show that isolated point defects can be located within a unit cell along the sample's depth. The influence of electron energy, dose, defocus, and convergence semi-angle is also explored to determine their role in governing defect contrast. These results guide experiments aiming to analyze point defects with multislice electron ptychography.</description>

      <title>Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments, is proposed for the search. Although the optimization did not function with the conventional one-hot encoding that had been effective in other material systems, the proposed encoding proved efficient in the search. As a result, two interesting semiconductor configurations were discovered. These configurations exhibit qualitatively similar patterns to conventional models, and one of the two is more stable than the conventional ones with the same periodicity. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. The proposed encoding method, which is easy to implement, is expected to expand the applicability of atomic configuration search using Bayesian optimization to a broader range of material systems.</description>

      <title>Copper delocalization leads to ultralow thermal conductivity in chalcohalide CuBiSeCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry and Thickness of Epitaxial SrTiO$_{3}$ on Silicon (001): an Investigation of Physical, Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$, STO) stands out as a promising material for various electronic applications thanks to its exceptional dielectric properties. Molecular beam epitaxy is one of the few techniques which allows epitaxial growth of STO directly on industry-relevant silicon substrates. However, maintaining precise stoichiometry and high crystalline quality in this process remains a significant challenge. Establishing this is essential to obtain STO with bulk-like dielectric properties and to minimize leakage current and optical absorbance. In this study, the importance of cationic stoichiometry and the effect of thickness are investigated for STO thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. We employed real-time reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) as a feedback loop mechanism to counteract Sr source oxidation and maintain a constant flux. Additionally, high-temperature post-growth annealing treatments in O$_{2}$ were investigated to promote layer relaxation and reduce oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby improving the physical, electrical, and optical properties of stoichiometric STO. As a result, high-quality STO thin films exceeding 100 nm were successfully fabricated featuring a bulk-like out-of-plane lattice parameter and refractive index, as well as rocking curve full width at half maximum below 0.2{\deg}, smooth surface (R$_{q}$ &lt; 0.2 nm) and a leakage current density below 1E-7 A/cm$^{2}$.</description>

      <title>KTaO3(001) Preparation Methods in Vacuum: Effects on Surface Stoichiometry, Crystallography, and in-gap States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ in applied magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2 description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a Zeeman term where the dipolar local $z$-component of the pseudospin couples to the local $z$-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local $x$- and $y$-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their octupolar character. Using effective Hamiltonian parameters determined in V. Poree et al., arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for [111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its sister compounds.</description>

      <title>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</title>

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ (Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$; $x = 0$ to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature ($T_c^{\rm onset}$) by 1.5 K and the critical current density ($J_c$) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas $J_c$ of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr-doping at Fe sites preserves $T_c^{\rm onset}$ and improves $J_c$ of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve $J_c$ properties without affecting $T_c^{\rm onset}$ through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB$_2$.</description>

      <title>Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>
