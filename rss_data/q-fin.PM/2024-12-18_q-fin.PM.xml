      <title>Hunting Tomorrow's Leaders: Using Machine Learning to Forecast S&amp;P 500 Additions &amp; Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies machine learning to predict S&amp;P 500 membership changes: key events that profoundly impact investor behavior and market dynamics. Quarterly data from WRDS datasets (2013 onwards) was used, incorporating features such as industry classification, financial data, market data, and corporate governance indicators. Using a Random Forest model, we achieved a test F1 score of 0.85, outperforming logistic regression and SVC models. This research not only showcases the power of machine learning for financial forecasting but also emphasizes model transparency through SHAP analysis and feature engineering. The model's real world applicability is demonstrated with predicted changes for Q3 2023, such as the addition of Uber (UBER) and the removal of SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). By incorporating these predictions into a trading strategy i.e. buying stocks announced for addition and shorting those marked for removal, we anticipate capturing alpha and enhancing investment decision making, offering valuable insights into index dynamics</description>

      <title>Market-Neutral Strategies in Mid-Cap Portfolio Management: A Data-Driven Approach to Long-Short Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-cap companies, generally valued between \$2 billion and \$10 billion, provide investors with a well-rounded opportunity between the fluctuation of small-cap stocks and the stability of large-cap stocks. This research builds upon the long-short equity approach (e.g., Michaud, 2018; Dimitriu, Alexander, 2002) customized for mid-cap equities, providing steady risk-adjusted returns yielding a significant Sharpe ratio of 2.132 in test data. Using data from 2013 to 2023, obtained from WRDS and following point-in-time (PIT) compliance, the approach guarantees clarity and reproducibility. Elements of essential financial indicators, such as profitability, valuation, and liquidity, were designed to improve portfolio optimization. Testing historical data across various markets conditions illustrates the stability and resilience of the tactic. This study highlights mid-cap stocks as an attractive investment route, overlooked by most analysts, which combine transparency with superior performance in managing portfolios.</description>

      <title>Expressions of Market-Based Correlations Between Prices and Returns of Two Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper derives the expressions of correlations between prices of two assets, returns of two assets, and price-return correlations of two assets that depend on statistical moments and correlations of the current values, past values, and volumes of their market trades. The usual frequency-based expressions of correlations of time series of prices and returns describe a partial case of our model when all trade volumes and past trade values are constant. Such an assumptions are rather far from market reality, and its use results in excess losses and wrong forecasts. Traders, banks, and funds that perform multi-million market transactions or manage billion-valued portfolios should consider the impact of large trade volumes on market prices and returns. The use of the market-based correlations of prices and returns of two assets is mandatory for them. The development of macroeconomic models and market forecasts like those being created by BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., is impossible without the use of market-based correlations of prices and returns of two assets.</description>

      <title>Optimal two-parameter portfolio management strategy with transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model for optimizing a single-asset portfolio in the presence of transaction costs given a signal with a certain autocorrelation and cross-correlation structure. In our setup, the portfolio manager is given two one-parameter controls to influence the construction of the portfolio. The first is a linear filtering parameter that may increase or decrease the level of autocorrelation in the signal. The second is a numerical threshold that determines a symmetric "no-trade" zone. Portfolio positions are constrained to a single unit long or a single unit short. These constraints allow us to focus on the interplay between the signal filtering mechanism and the hysteresis introduced by the "no-trade" zone. We then formulate an optimization problem where we aim to minimize the frequency of trades subject to a fixed return level of the portfolio. We show that maintaining a no-trade zone while removing autocorrelation entirely from the signal yields a locally optimal solution. For any given "no-trade" zone threshold, this locally optimal solution also achieves the maximum attainable return level, and we derive a quantitative lower bound for the amount of improvement in terms of the given threshold and the amount of autocorrelation removed.</description>
