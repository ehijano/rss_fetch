      <title>Persistent Intrinsic Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method to estimate the area, and more generally the intrinsic volumes, of a compact subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ from a set $Y$ that is close in the Hausdorff distance. This estimator enjoys a linear rate of convergence as a function of the Hausdorff distance under mild regularity conditions on $X$. Our approach combines tools from both geometric measure theory and persistent homology, extending the noise filtering properties of persistent homology from the realm of topology to geometry. Along the way, we obtain a stability result for intrinsic volumes.</description>

      <title>Mobility of geometric constraint systems with extrusion symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If we take a (bar-joint) framework, prepare an identical copy of this framework, translate it by some vector $\tau$, and finally join corresponding points of the two copies, then we obtain a framework with `extrusion' symmetry in the direction of $\tau$. This process may be repeated $t$ times to obtain a framework whose underlying graph has $\mathbb{Z}_2^t$ as a subgroup of its automorphism group and which has `$t$-fold extrusion' symmetry. We show that while $t$-fold extrusion symmetry is not a point-group symmetry, the rigidity matrix of a framework with $t$-fold extrusion symmetry can still be transformed into a block-decomposed form in the analogous way as for point-group symmetric frameworks. This allows us to use Fowler-Guest-type character counts to analyse the mobility of such frameworks. We show that this entire theory also extends to the more general point-hyperplane frameworks with $t$-fold extrusion symmetry. Moreover, we show that under suitable regularity conditions the infinitesimal flexes we detect with our symmetry-adapted counts extend to finite (continuous) motions. Finally, we establish an algorithm that checks for finite motions via linearly displacing framework points along velocity vectors of infinitesimal motions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds with boundary of polyhedral type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact orientable 3-manifold with hyperbolizable interior and non-empty boundary such that all boundary components have genii at least 2. We study an Alexandrov-Weyl-type problem for convex hyperbolic cone-metrics on $\partial M$. We consider a class of hyperbolic metrics on M with convex boundary, which we call bent metrics, and which naturally generalize hyperbolic metrics on $M$ with convex polyhedral boundary. We show that for each convex hyperbolic cone-metric $d$ on $\partial M$, with few simple exceptions, there exists a bent metric on $M$ such that the induced intrinsic metric on $\partial M$ is $d$. Next, we prove that if a bent realization is what we call controllably polyhedral, then it is unique up to isotopy. We exhibit a large subclass of hyperbolic cone-metrics on $\partial M,$ called balanced, which is open and dense among all convex hyperbolic cone-metrics in the sense of Lipschitz topology, and for which we show that their bent realizations are controllably polyhedral. We additionally prove that any convex realization of a convex hyperbolic cone-metric on $\partial M$ is bent.
  Finally, we deduce that there exists an open subset of the space of convex cocompact metrics on the interior of $M$, including all metrics with polyhedral convex cores, such that the metrics in this subset are (1) globally rigid with respect to the induced intrinsic metrics on the boundaries of their convex cores; (2) infinitesimally rigid with respect to their bending laminations. This gives partial progress towards conjectures of W. Thurston.</description>
