      <title>Towards a Quantitative Theory of Digraph-Based Complexes and its Applications in Brain Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed new mathematical methods for analyzing network topology and applied these methods to the analysis of brain networks. More specifically, we rigorously developed quantitative methods based on complexes constructed from digraphs (digraph-based complexes), such as path complexes and directed clique complexes (alternatively, we refer to these complexes as "higher-order structures," or "higher-order topologies," or "simplicial structures"), and, in the case of directed clique complexes, also methods based on the interrelations between the directed cliques, what we called "directed higher-order connectivities." This new quantitative theory for digraph-based complexes can be seen as a step towards the formalization of a "quantitative simplicial theory." Subsequently, we used these new methods, such as characterization measures and similarity measures for digraph-based complexes, to analyze the topology of digraphs derived from brain connectivity estimators, specifically the estimator known as information partial directed coherence (iPDC), which is a multivariate estimator that can be considered a representation of Granger causality in the frequency-domain, particularly estimated from electroencephalography (EEG) data from patients diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy, in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands, to try to find new biomarkers based on the higher-order structures and connectivities of these digraphs. In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions: How does the higher-order topology of the brain network change from the pre-ictal to the ictal phase, from the ictal to the post-ictal phase, at each frequency band and in each cerebral hemisphere? Does the analysis of higher-order structures provide new and better biomarkers for seizure dynamics and also for the laterality of the seizure focus than the usual graph theoretical analyses?</description>

      <title>Orienting gaze toward a visual target: Neurophysiological synthesis with epistemological considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of an object triggers an orienting gaze movement toward its location. The movement consists of a rapid rotation of the eyes, the saccade, which is accompanied by a head rotation if the target eccentricity exceeds the oculomotor range, by a slow eye movement if it moves. Completing a previous report, we explain the numerous points that lead to questioning the validity of a one-to-one correspondence relation between measured physical values of gaze or head orientation and neuronal activity. Conflating kinematic (or dynamic) numerical values with neurophysiological recordings carries the risk of believing that central neuron activity directly encodes gaze or head orientation rather than mediating changes in extraocular and neck muscle contraction. Rather than reducing mismatches between extrinsic physical parameters (such as position or velocity errors), eye and head movements are behavioral expressions of intrinsic processes that restore a poly-equilibrium, i.e., balances of activities opposing antagonistic visuomotor channels. Past results obtained in the cat and monkey left a treasure allowing a synthesis, which illustrates the tremendous complexity underlying the changes in the orientations of the eyes and head. Its aim is to serve as a guide for further investigations in marmosets or for comparison with other species.</description>

      <title>Fairness, not Emotion, Drives Socioeconomic Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion and fairness play a key role in mediating socioeconomic decisions in humans; however, the underlying neurocognitive mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the interplay between proposers' emotions and fairness of offer magnitudes in rational decision-making. Employing a time-bound UG paradigm, 40 (male, age: 18-20) participants were exposed to three distinct proposers' emotions (Happy, Neutral, and Disgusted) followed by one of the three offer ranges (Low, Intermediate, Maximum). Our findings show a robust influence of fairness of offer on acceptance rates, with the impact of emotions obtained only within the low offer range. The increment of the offer amount resulted in shorter reaction times, while emotional stimuli resulted in prolonged reaction times. A multilevel generalized linear model showed offer as the dominant predictor of trial-specific responses. Subsequent agglomerative clustering grouped participants into five primary clusters based on responses modulated by emotions/offers. The Drift Diffusion Model based on the clustering further corroborated our findings. Emotion-sensitive markers, including N170 and LPP, demonstrated the participants' effect on facial expressions; however, facial emotions had minimal effect on subsequent socioeconomic decisions. Our study suggests that, in general, participants gave more preference to the fairness of the offer with a slight effect of emotions in decision-making. We show that though emotion is perceived and has an effect on decision-making time, people mostly prioritise financial gain and fairness of offer. Moreover, it establishes a connection between reaction time and responses and further dives deep into individualistic decision-making processes revealing different cognitive strategies.</description>

      <title>A point process approach for the classification of noisy calcium imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study noisy calcium imaging data, with a focus on the classification of spike traces. As raw traces obscure the true temporal structure of neuron's activity, we performed a tuned filtering of the calcium concentration using two methods: a biophysical model and a kernel mapping. The former characterizes spike trains related to a particular triggering event, while the latter filters out the signal and refines the selection of the underlying neuronal response. Transitioning from traditional time series analysis to point process theory, the study explores spike-time distance metrics and point pattern prototypes to describe repeated observations. We assume that the analyzed neuron's firing events, i.e. spike occurrences, are temporal point process events. In particular, the study aims to categorize 47 point patterns by depth, assuming the similarity of spike occurrences within specific depth categories. The results highlight the pivotal roles of depth and stimuli in discerning diverse temporal structures of neuron firing events, confirming the point process approach based on prototype analysis is largely useful in the classification of spike traces.</description>

      <title>Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron models using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.</description>

      <title>Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the associated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.</description>

      <title>Exploring Biological Neuronal Correlations with Quantum Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A standardised open science framework for sharing and re-analysing neural data acquired to continuous stimuli</title>

Abstract: Neurophysiology research has demonstrated that it is possible and valuable to investigate sensory processing in scenarios involving continuous sensory streams, such as speech and music. Over the past 10 years or so, novel analytic frameworks combined with the growing participation in data sharing has led to a surge of publicly available datasets involving continuous sensory experiments. However, open science efforts in this domain of research remain scattered, lacking a cohesive set of guidelines. This paper presents an end-to-end open science framework for the storage, analysis, sharing, and re-analysis of neural data recorded during continuous sensory experiments. We propose a data structure that builds on existing custom structures (Continuous-event Neural Data or CND), providing precise naming conventions and data types, as well as a workflow for storing and loading data in the general-purpose BIDS structure. The framework has been designed to interface with existing EEG/MEG analysis toolboxes, such as Eelbrain, NAPLib, MNE, and mTRF-Toolbox. We present guidelines by taking both the user view (rapidly re-analyse existing data) and the experimenter view (store, analyse, and share), making the process straightforward and accessible. Additionally, we introduce a web-based data browser that enables the effortless replication of published results and data re-analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing learning in spiking neural networks through neuronal heterogeneity and neuromodulatory signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from neuroscience, particularly with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). This has significantly enhanced the replication of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite these advances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional and morphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computational capabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatory effects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at two spatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticity at the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities. In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules and architectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs. Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how the proposed approach integrates brain-inspired compartmental models and task-driven SNNs, balances bioinspiration and complexity, and provides scalable solutions for pressing AI challenges, such as continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency.</description>
