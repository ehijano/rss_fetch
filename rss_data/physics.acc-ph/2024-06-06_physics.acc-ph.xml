      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Proton and Carbon-12 Ion Beam for Tumor/Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treating cancer is one of the most challenging task in medical sciences. Only limited types of cancer treatments are available as their study is still ongoing. The earlier therapies like radiotherapy with x-rays, chemotherapy are associated with lot of side-effects. One of the most desirable cancer treatment is using particle beam therapies. These therapies are quite less risky than other types of cancer and tumor treatments. In this paper we present the proton and carbon-12 ion beam simulation that can help in tumor and cancer treatment. We simulated the proton and carbon-12 ion beam in water and soft tissue using geant4 toolkit. The protons are observed to have much better energy deposition in the water and soft tissue than carbon-12 ion and gamma photon beams.</description>

      <title>{\mu}TRISTAN and LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC Based Antimuon-Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of {\mu^+}{e^-} and {\mu^+}{\mu^+} colliders, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar {\mu^+} ring tangential to LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC will give an opportunity to realize {\mu^+}p and {\mu^+}A collisions at multi-TeV scale center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration: L exceeds {10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}p colliders and {10^{30} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}A colliders. Certainly, proposed colliders will provide huge potential for both SM (especially QCD basics) and BSM physics searches.</description>
