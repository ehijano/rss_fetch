      <title>Quasars can Signpost Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies, and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most seven times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Quasars should therefore be prioritized as targets for SMBHB searches in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multi-Epoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of nine canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from one to three years. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey and obtain scintillation arc curvature measurements for four pulsars, detecting multiple arcs for two of them. Using updated pulsar distance estimates, we find evidence of previously undocumented scattering screens along the line of sight (LOS) of PSRs J1645$-$0317 and J2022$+$5154, as well as evidence that one of the arcs along the LOS to PSR J2313$+$4253 may reside somewhere within the Orion-Cygnus arm of the Milky Way. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and those predicted by the NE2001 electron density model. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar's dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory's 20m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Acceleration of Electrons, Positrons and Protons at a Nonrelativistic Quasiparallel Collisionless Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energetic positrons have been observed in the interstellar medium, and high-energy positrons with relativistic energies up to approximately 1 TeV have been detected in Galactic cosmic rays. We conducted a study on the acceleration of particles, specifically positrons, in a nonrelativistic quasiparallel collisionless shock induced by a plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and positrons. The positron-to-proton number density ratio in the plasma is 0.1. We focused on a representative shock with a sonic Mach number of 17.1 and an Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number of 16.8 in the rest frame of the shock. To investigate the acceleration mechanisms of particles including positrons in the shock, we utilized one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. It was found that all three species of particles in the shock can be accelerated and exhibit power law spectra. At the shock front, a significant portion of incoming upstream particles are reflected and undergo significant energy increase, and these reflected particles can be efficiently injected into the process of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moveover, the reflected positrons can be further accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field when they move along the magnetic field upstream of the shock. As a result, positrons can be preferentially accelerated to be injected in the DSA process compared to electrons.</description>

      <title>The variable radio jet of the accreting neutron star the Rapid Burster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rapid Burster is a unique neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system, showing both thermonuclear Type-I and accretion-driven Type-II X-ray bursts. Recent studies have demonstrated how coordinated observations of X-ray and radio variability can constrain jet properties of accreting neutron stars - particularly when the X-ray variability is dominated by discrete changes. We present a simultaneous VLA, Swift, and INTEGRAL observing campaign of the Rapid Burster to investigate whether its jet responds to Type-II bursts. We observe the radio counterpart of the X-ray binary at its faintest-detected radio luminosity, while the X-ray observations reveal prolific, fast X-ray bursting. A time-resolved analysis reveals that the radio counterpart varies significantly between observing scans, displaying a fractional variability of $38 \pm 5$%. The radio faintness of the system prevents the robust identification of a causal relation between individual Type-II bursts and the evolution of the radio jet. However, based on a comparison of its low radio luminosity with archival Rapid Burster observations and other accreting neutron stars, and on a qualitative assessment of the X-ray and radio light curves, we explore the presence of a tentative connection between bursts and jet: i.e., the Type-II bursts may weaken or strengthen the jet. The former of those two scenarios would fit with magneto-rotational jet models; we discuss three lines of future research to establish this potential relation between Type-II bursts and jets more confidently.</description>

      <title>Primary and secondary source of energy in the superluminous supernova 2018ibb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the pair-instability origin of superluminous supernova 2018ibb. As the base model, we use a non-rotating stellar model with an initial mass of 250 Msun at about 1/15 solar metallicity. We consider three versions of the model as input for radiative transfer simulations done with the STELLA and ARTIS codes: with 25 Msun of 56Ni, 34 Msun of 56Ni, and a chemically mixed case with 34 Msun of 56Ni. We present light curves and spectra in comparison to the observed data of SN 2018ibb, and conclude that the pair-instability supernova model with 34 Msun of 56Ni explains broad-band light curves reasonably well between -100 and 250 days around the peak. Our synthetic spectra have many similarities with the observed spectra. The luminosity excess in the light curves and the blue-flux excess in the spectra can be explained by an additional energy source, which may be interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar matter. We discuss possible mechanisms of the origin of the circumstellar matter being ejected in the decades before the pair-instability explosion.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes and very high-energy neutrinos: the case of NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-messenger study of NGC 1068, the prototype Seyfert II galaxy recently associated with high-energy IceCube neutrinos. Various aspects of the source, including its nuclear activity, jet, outflow, and starburst region, are analyzed in detail using a multi-wavelength approach and relevant luminosities are derived. We then explore its gamma-ray and neutrino emissions and investigate potential mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations with the different astrophysical components to try to understand which one is responsible for the IceCube neutrinos. By first using simple order-of-magnitude arguments and then applying specific theoretical models, we infer that only the region close to the accretion disc around the supermassive black hole has both the right density of X-ray photons needed to provide the targets for protons to sustain neutrino production and of optical/infrared photons required to absorb the associated but unobserved gamma rays. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts to constrain a possible broad connection between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei, as well as future synergies between astronomical and neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Did Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817 Leave Behind A Long-lived Neutron Star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the observational implications of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 leaving behind a rapidly rotating massive neutron star that launches a relativistic, equatorial outflow as well as a jet. We show that if the equatorial outflow (ring) is highly beamed in the equatorial plane, its luminosity can be "hidden" from view until late times, even if carrying a significant fraction of the spin-down energy of the merger remnant. This hidden ring reveals itself as a re-brightening in the light curve once it slows down enough for Earth to be within the ring's relativistic beaming solid angle. We compute semi-analytic light curves using this model and find they are in agreement with the observations thus far, and we provide predictions for the ensuing afterglow.</description>

      <title>Rapid detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using sparse dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17721v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines for compact binary coalescence based on matched-filtering have reported over 90 confident detections during the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network. Decreasing the latency of detection, in particular for future detectors anticipated to have high detection rates, remains an ongoing effort. In this paper, we develop and test a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm for the rapid detection of GWs. We evaluate the algorithms biases and estimate its GW detection rate for an astrophysical population of binary black holes. The SDL algorithm is assessed using both, simulated data injected into the proposed A+ detector sensitivity and real data containing confident detections from the third LVK observing run. We find that our SDL algorithm can reconstruct a single binary black hole signal in less than 1 s. This suggests that SDL could be regarded as a promising approach for rapid, efficient GW detection in future observing runs of ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Motivating Emissions from Positive Energy Warp Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has proposed that advanced propulsion mechanisms such as warp drives are more physically feasible than previously thought, using positive energy sources potentially sourced by known classical physics. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that an advanced inter-planetary or interstellar civilization using warp drives at sub-luminal or super-luminal speeds will broadcast detectable emissions of their travels. These technosignatures would be of significant astronomical, physical, and technological interest. This paper seeks to motivate signatures from warp drive emissions due to intrinsic and extrinsic processes across several messenger types (electromagnetic, particle, and gravitational) and propose a research program to simulate such emissions in sufficient detail to search for their signatures through coordinated analyses across multiple observatories.</description>

      <title>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that axions could have been produced through the Primakoff process within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain, for the first time, higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly $50$ $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become a leading contender to explain most, if not all, Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs &lt;= 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD &lt;= 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.</description>

      <title>Causal fermion states in magnetic field in relativistic rotating frame and electromagnetic radiation by rapidly rotating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain posterior distribution of equations of state (EOSs) across a broad range of density by imposing explicitly the constraints from precisely measured fundamental properties of finite nuclei, in combination with the experimental data from heavy-ion collisions and the astrophysical observations of radius, tidal deformability and minimum-maximum mass of neutron stars. The acquired EOSs exhibit a distinct global behavior compared to those usually obtained by imposing the finite nuclei constraints implicitly through empirical values of selected key parameters describing symmetric nuclear matter and symmetry energy in the vicinity of the saturation density. The explicit treatment of finite nuclei constraints yields softer EOSs at low densities which eventually become stiffer to meet the maximum mass criteria. The Kullback-Leibler divergence has been used to perform a quantitative comparison of the distributions of neutron star properties resulting from the EOSs obtained from implicit and explicit finite nuclei constraints.</description>

      <title>Sloshing and spiral structures breeding a putative radio mini-halo in the environment of a cool-core cluster Abell 795</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral structures and cold fronts in X-rays are frequently observed in cool core galaxy clusters. However, studies on radio mini-haloes associated with such spirals and their physical connections are rare. Here, we present the detection of an extended diffuse radio emission entrained in the X-ray spiral structure in a known cool core cluster Abell 795 (A795). Though the cool core is a sign of the relaxed nature of the clusters, our re-analysed 30 ks Chandra X-ray data of cluster A795 confirms the presence of an interesting log spiral structure of X-ray deficit region complemented by an X-ray excess counter spiral in the residual map, exposing its dynamical activity. Our new analysis of 150 $\&amp;$ 325 MHz GMRT archival data of the cluster confirms the detection of a $\sim180$ kpc ultra-steep ($\alpha\sim-2.7$) diffuse radio structure which was previously reported as a candidate radio mini halo from low sensitive survey maps. This radio emission spans the entire spiral structure ($\sim186$ kpc), enclosed by two previously reported cold fronts. Furthermore, SDSS DR13 optical spectra, as well as GALEX's FUV data, show a considerably low total star formation rate of 2.52 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and having no significant variation in metallicity distribution. We argued that the two-phase (hot and cold) plasma at the cluster core with differential velocity has probably caused the spiral formation and has redistributed the secondary electrons from the central BCG or the pre-accelerated electrons which have been (re-)accelerated by the sloshing turbulence to form the observed candidate radio mini-halo structure. This has been supported by a few previous studies that indicate spiral formation and sloshing turbulence may quench star formation and facilitate smooth metallicity distribution by mixing the gas in the core.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <title>GRMHD simulations of accretion flows onto massive binary black hole mergers embedded in a thin slab of gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of merging equal-mass, spinning black holes embedded in an equatorial thin slab of magnetized gas. We evolve black holes either non-spinning, with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum, and with misaligned spins. The rest-mass density of the gas slab follows a Gaussian profile symmetric relative to the equatorial plane and it is initially either stationary or with Keplerian rotational support. As part of our diagnostics, we follow the accretion of matter onto the black hole horizons and the Poynting luminosity. Throughout the inspiral phase, the configurations with non-zero spins display modulations in the mass accretion rate that are proportional to the orbital frequency and its multiples. Our frequency analysis suggests that these modulations are influenced by the initial geometry and angular momentum of the gas distribution. In contrast to binary models evolved in the gas cloud scenario, we do not observe a significant increase in the mass accretion rate after the merger in any of our simulations. This observation brings attention to a potential link between the electromagnetic signatures of massive binary black hole mergers and the geometrical distribution of the surrounding gas. It also suggests the possibility of not detecting a peak luminosity at the time of merger in future electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the electromagnetic signatures of Bethe-Heitler pair production process in blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ''twin birth'' of a positron and an electron by a photon in the presence of a nucleus, known as Bethe-Heitler pair production, is a key process in astroparticle physics. The Bethe-Heitler process offers a way of channeling energy stored in a population of relativistic protons (or nuclei) to relativistic pairs with extended distributions. Contrary to accelerated leptons, whose maximum energy is limited by radiative losses, the maximal energy of pairs is determined by the kinematics of the process and can be as high as the parent proton energy. We take a closer look at the features of the injected pair distribution, and provide a novel empirical function that describes the spectrum of pairs produced by interactions of single-energy protons with single-energy photons. The function is the kernel of the Bethe-Heitler pair production spectrum that replaces a double numerical integration involving the complex differential cross section of the process, and can be easily implemented in numerical codes. We further examine under which conditions Bethe-Heitler pairs produced in blazar jets can emit $\gamma$-ray photons via synchrotron radiation, thus providing an alternative to the inverse Compton scattering process for high-energy emission in jetted active galactic nuclei. After taking into consideration the broadband spectral characteristics of the source, the jet energetics, and the properties of radiation fields present in the blazar environment, we conclude that $\gamma$-rays in low- and intermediate-peaked blazars may arise from Bethe-Heitler pairs in regions of the jet with typical transverse size $\sim 10^{15}$ cm and co-moving magnetic field $5-500$ G.</description>

      <title>A new understanding of the Gemini-Monoceros X-ray enhancement from discoveries with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gemini-Monoceros X-ray enhancement is a rich field for studying diffuse X-ray emission and supernova remnants (SNRs). With the launch of eROSITA onboard the SRG platform in 2019, we are now able to fully study these sources. Many of the SNRs in the vicinity are suspected to be very old remnants, which are severely understudied in X-rays due to numerous observational challenges. In addition, identification of new faint large SNRs might help to solve the long-standing discrepancy of observed and expected number of Galactic SNRs.
  We performed a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the entire diffuse structure and a detailed background analysis of the vicinity. We also made use of multi-wavelength data to better understand the morphology and to constrain the distances to the different sources. We estimated the plasma properties of the sources and calculated a grid of model SNRs to determine the individual SNR properties.
  Most of the diffuse plasma of the Monogem Ring SNR is well described by a single non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) component with an average temperature of $kT = 0.14\pm 0.03$ keV. We obtain an age of $\approx 1.2\cdot 10^5$ yr - consistent with PSR B0656+14 - for the Monogem Ring. In the south-east, we found evidence for a hotter second plasma component and a possible new SNR candidate at $\approx 300$ pc, with the new candidate having an age of $\approx 50,000$ yr. We were also able to improve on previous studies on the more distant Monoceros Loop and PKS 0646+06 SNRs. We obtained significantly higher temperatures than previous studies, and for PKS 0646+06 a much lower estimated age of the SNR. We also found a new SNR candidate G190.4+12.5 which most likely is located at $D &gt; 1.5 $ kpc, expanding into a low density medium at a high distance from the Galactic plane, with an estimated age of $40,000-60,000$ yr.</description>

      <title>Possible spectral irregularities in the AMS-02 positron spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excesses in the electron and positron spectra observed by many experiments, such as PAMELA and AMS-02, have sparked significant theoretical investigation. It is not easy to distinguish the two primary hypotheses dark matter annihilation/decay and pulsars from the spectral features. Should pulsars be the source of this excess, the expected variability in their distribution may introduce distinct irregularities in the positron energy spectrum. In this study, we use an irregularity estimator to detect these potential features in the positron energy spectrum of AMS-02. Our analysis of the current AMS-02 data reveals these spectral irregularities with a statistical significance of $1.75\sigma$. However, our projection indicates that, with AMS-02 data collected over a period of 20 years, such irregularities could be identified with a confidence level of $3\sigma$ level in 71\% of our simulations.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate on $^{56}{\rm Ni}$ nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions are key to our understanding of stellar evolution, particularly the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate, which is known to significantly influence the lower and upper ends of the black hole (BH) mass distribution due to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). However, these reaction rates have not been sufficiently determined. We use the $\texttt{MESA}$ stellar evolution code to explore the impact of uncertainty in the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate on PISN explosions, focusing on nucleosynthesis and explosion energy by considering the high resolution of the initial mass. Our findings show that the mass of synthesized radioactive nickel ($^{56}{\rm Ni}$) and the explosion energy increase with $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate for the same initial mass, except in the high-mass edge region. With a high (about twice the $\texttt{STARLIB}$ standard value) rate, the maximum amount of nickel produced falls below 70 $M_\odot$, while with a low rate (about half of the standard value) it increases up to 83.9 $M_\odot$. These results highlight that carbon "preheating" plays a crucial role in PISNe by determining core concentration when a star initiates expansion. Our results also suggest that the onset of the expansion, which means the end of compression, competes with collapse caused by helium photodisintegration, and the maximum mass that can lead to an explosion depends on the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the $\Delta m^2_{21}$ tension with supernova neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One long-standing tension in the determination of neutrino parameters is the mismatched value of the solar mass square difference, $\Delta m_{21}^2$, measured by different experiments: the reactor antineutrino experiment KamLAND finds a best fit larger than the one obtained with solar neutrino data. Even if the current tension is mild ($\sim 1.5\sigma$), it is timely to explore if independent measurements could help in either closing or reassessing this issue. In this regard, we explore how a future supernova burst in our galaxy could be used to determine $\Delta m_{21}^2$ at the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and how this could contribute to the current situation. We study Earth matter effects for different models of supernova neutrino spectra and supernova orientations. We find that, if supernova neutrino data prefers the KamLAND best fit for $\Delta m_{21}^2$, an uncertainty similar to the current KamLAND one could be achieved. On the contrary, if it prefers the solar neutrino data best fit, the current tension with KamLAND results could grow to a significance larger than $5\sigma$. Furthermore, supernova neutrinos could significantly contribute to reducing the uncertainty on $\sin^2\theta_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Halo Densities and Pericenter Distances of the Bright Milky Way Satellites as a Test of Dark Matter Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new constraints on the dark matter halo density profile of Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using the phase-space distribution function (DF) method. After assessing the systematics of the approach against mock data from the Gaia Challenge project, we apply the DF analysis to the entire kinematic sample of well-measured MW dwarf satellites for the first time. Contrary to previous findings for some of these objects, we find that the DF analysis yields results consistent with the standard Jeans analysis. In particular, in the present study we rediscover: i) a large diversity in the inner halo densities of dSphs (bracketed by Draco and Fornax), and ii) an anti-correlation between inner halo density and pericenter distance of the bright MW satellites. Regardless of the strength of the anti-correlation, we find that the distribution of these satellites in density vs. pericenter space is inconsistent with the results of the high-res N-body simulations that include a disk potential. Our analysis motivates further studies on the role of internal feedback and dark matter microphysics in these dSphs.</description>

      <title>Effects of stimulated emission and superradiant growth of non-spherical axion cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the stimulated emission of photons in non-spherical axion clusters with or without the axion source from the superradiance of a rotating black hole (BH). In particular, we focus on the cluster with the initial axion distribution in the $(l,m)=(1,1)$ mode which mimics the shape of an axion cloud induced by the BH superradiance. After establishing the hierarchy of Boltzmann equations governing a general non-spherical axion-photon system, we examine the evolution of photon and axion distributions in the cluster and possible stimulated emission signals. In the case without the axion source, the resultant signal would be a single photon pulse. As for the system with the BH superradiance as the axion source, multiple pulses are predicted. We also show that, for the latter case, the combined effects of stimulated emissions and the axion production from the BH superradiance could reach a balance where the axion cluster becomes uniformly and spherically distributed. Due to the energy and temporal characteristics of the obtained pulses, we demonstrate that the stimulated emissions from the axion cluster with axions sourced by the BH superradiance provide a candidate explanation to the observed fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Sudden breakdown of effective field theory near cool Kerr-Newman black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Light Thermal Dark Matter Beyond $p$-Wave Annihilation in Minimal Higgs Portal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores a minimal renormalizable dark matter (DM) model, incorporating a sub-GeV Majorana DM and a singlet scalar particle $\phi$. Using scalar and pseudo-scalar interactions (couplings $c_s$ and $c_p$), we investigate implications for DM detection, considering $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and combined ($s$+$p$ wave) contributions in DM annihilation cross-section, as well as loop-correction contributions to DM-nucleon elastic scattering. Identifying a broad parameter space ($10 \,\rm{MeV} &lt; m_\chi \lesssim m_\phi$) within the $2\sigma$ allowed region, we explore scenarios ($\left|c_s\right|\gg \left|c_p\right|$, $\left|c_s\right|\ll \left|c_p\right|$, and $\left|c_s\right|\approx \left|c_p\right|$). We find that (i) a non-zero pseudo-scalar coupling alleviates direct detection constraints as a comparison with the previous pure scalar coupling case; (ii) CMB observations set stringent limits on pseudo-scalar interaction dominant cases, making $s$-wave annihilation viable only for $m_\chi&gt;1\,\rm{GeV}$; (iii) the preferred $\phi$-resonance region can be tested in the future indirect detection experiments, such as e-ASTROGAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>
