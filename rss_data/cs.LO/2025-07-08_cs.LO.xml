      <title>The Dependently Typed Higher-Order Form for the TPTP World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the current research and development in the field of automated reasoning builds on the infrastructure provided by the TPTP World. The TPTP language for logical formulae is central to the far-reaching adoption of the TPTP World. This paper introduces the Dependently Typed higher-order Form (DTF) of the TPTP language. It takes advantage of already established binders in the syntax, and is thus a minimally intrusive extension to the Typed Higher-order Form (THF). A starting set of over 100 problems is provided to exhibit the usefulness and incite interest in DTF. Some tools that are already able to reason about problems in the DTF language are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate learning guided Automated Theorem Proving as Partial Label Learning, building the first bridge across these fields of research and providing a theoretical framework for dealing with alternative proofs during learning. We use the plCoP theorem prover to demonstrate that methods from the Partial Label Learning literature tend to increase the performance of learning assisted theorem provers.</description>

      <title>Difference of Constrained Patterns in Logically Constrained Term Rewrite Systems (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04080v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering patterns as sets of their instances, a difference operator over patterns computes a finite set of two given patterns, which represents the difference between the dividend pattern and the divisor pattern. A complement of a pattern is a pattern set, the ground constructor instances of which comprise the complement of the ground constructor instances of the former pattern. Given finitely many unconstrained linear patterns, using a difference operator over linear patterns, a complement algorithm returns a finite set of linear patterns as a complement of the given patterns. In this paper, we extend the difference operator and complement algorithm to constrained linear patterns used in logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs, for short) that have no user-defined constructor term with a sort for built-in values. Then, as for left-linear term rewrite systems, using the complement algorithm, we show that quasi-reducibility is decidable for such LCTRSs with decidable built-in theories. For the single use of the difference operator over constrained patterns, only divisor patterns are required to be linear.</description>

      <title>Omega-regular Verification and Control for Distributional Specifications in MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical approach to studying Markov decision processes (MDPs) is to view them as state transformers. However, MDPs can also be viewed as distribution transformers, where an MDP under a strategy generates a sequence of probability distributions over MDP states. This view arises in several applications, even as the probabilistic model checking problem becomes much harder compared to the classical state transformer counterpart. It is known that even distributional reachability and safety problems become computationally intractable (Skolem- and positivity-hard). To address this challenge, recent works focused on sound but possibly incomplete methods for verification and control of MDPs under the distributional view. However, existing automated methods are applicable only to distributional reachability, safety and reach-avoidance specifications.
  In this work, we present the first automated method for verification and control of MDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. To achieve this, we propose a novel notion of distributional certificates, which are sound and complete proof rules for proving that an MDP under a distributionally memoryless strategy satisfies some distributional omega-regular specification. We then use our distributional certificates to design the first fully automated algorithms for verification and control of MDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. Our algorithms follow a template-based synthesis approach and provide soundness and relative completeness guarantees, while running in PSPACE. Our prototype implementation demonstrates practical applicability of our algorithms to challenging examples collected from the literature.</description>

      <title>Shininess, strong politeness, and unicorns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shininess and strong politeness are properties related to theory combination procedures. In a paper titled "Many-sorted equivalence of shiny and strongly polite theories", Casal and Rasga proved that for decidable theories, these properties are equivalent. We refine their result by showing that: (i) shiny theories are always decidable, and therefore strongly polite; and (ii) there are (undecidable) strongly polite theories that are not shiny. This line of research is tightly related to a recent series of papers that have sought to classify all the relations between theory combination properties. We finally complete this project, resolving all of the remaining problems that were previously left open.</description>

      <title>Proof Analysis of A Foundational Classical Singlesuccedent Sequent Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the question: 'How can A Foundational Classical Singlesuccedent Sequent Calculus be formulated?' The choice of this particular area of proof-theoretic study is based on a particular ground that is, to formulate a robust and foundational classical singlesuccedent sequent calculus that includes a number of novel rules with the ultimate aim of deriving the singlesuccedent sequent {\Gamma} sequent arrow C. To this end, we argue that among all standard sequent calculi (at least to the best of our knowledge) there is no classical singlesuccedent sequent calculus that can be considered the rightful successor to Gerhard Gentzen's (1935) original LK system. However, we also contend that while several classical singlesuccedent sequent calculi exist such as Sara Negri's and Jan von Plato's (2001 &amp; 2011) G3ip+Gem-at and G0ip+Gem0-at calculi, none of these proof systems possess the classical proof-theoretic potential to meet the formal expectations of a dedicated classical proof theorist. Conversely, we shall demonstrate that our forthcoming system, namely G-Calculus through its classical division i.e. Gc has been entirely designed to meet these expectations. Prior to commencing our enquiry, a supplementary note must be made and that is in this work when discussing various sequent calculi, for proof-theoretic purposes, we are primarily concerned with their propositional components rather than their predicate divisions except in G-Calculus where we examine both aspects.</description>

      <title>A Note on Runtime Verification of Concurrent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize the information gained from a single execution when verifying a concurrent system, one can derive all concurrency-aware equivalent executions and check them against linear specifications. This paper offers an alternative perspective on verification of concurrent systems by leveraging trace-based logics rather than sequence-based formalisms. Linear Temporal Logic over Mazurkiewicz Traces (LTrL) operates on partial-order representations of executions, meaning that once a single execution is specified, all equivalent interleavings are implicitly considered. This paper introduces a three valued version of LTrL, indicating whether the so-far observed execution of the concurrent system is one of correct, incorrect or inconclusive, together with a suitable monitor synthesis procedure. To this end, the paper recalls a construction of trace-consistent B\"uchi automata for LTrL formulas and explains how to employ it in well-understood monitor synthesis procedures. In this way, a monitor results that yields for any linearization of an observed trace the same verification verdict.</description>

      <title>Testing for Renamability to Classes of Clause Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of testing clause sets for membership in classes known from literature. In particular, we are interested in classes defined via renaming: Is it possible to rename the predicates in a way such that positive and negative literals satisfy certain conditions? We show that for classes like Horn or OCC1N, the existence of such renamings can be decided in polynomial time, whereas the same problem is NP-complete for class PVD. The decision procedures are based on hyper-resolution; if a renaming exists, it can be extracted from the final saturated clause set.</description>

      <title>Efficient Certified Reasoning for Binarized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$ speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only $62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.</description>

      <title>Holographic Projection and Cyber Attack Surface: A Physical Analogy for Digital Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an in-depth exploration of the analogy between the Holographic Principle in theoretical physics and cyber attack surfaces in digital security. Building on concepts such as black hole entropy and AdS/CFT duality, it highlights how complex infrastructures project their vulnerabilities onto their external interfaces. The paper draws a parallel between a black hole's event horizon, which encodes all internal information, and the attack surface, which reflects the internal architecture's security posture. Additionally, the article outlines how this conceptual framework can guide cybersecurity practices, emphasizing strategies such as attack surface reduction, continuous scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP and Greenbone OpenVAS, and the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture. This analogy not only provides a unique perspective on digital security but also underscores the critical importance of boundary-level defenses in protecting vast internal infrastructures.</description>

      <title>On Complementation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata without Full Determinization (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementation of finite automata is a basic operation used in numerous applications. The standard way to complement a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is to transform it into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and complement the DFA. The DFA can, however, be exponentially larger than the corresponding NFA. In this paper, we study several alternative approaches to complementation, which are based either on reverse powerset construction or on two novel constructions that exploit a commonly occurring structure of NFAs. Our experiment on a large data set shows that using a different than the classical approach can in many cases yield significantly smaller complements.</description>

      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part IIb: Moschovakis' operator and other non-determinisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BSS RAMs were introduced to provide a mathematical framework for characterizing algorithms over first-order structures. Non-deterministic BSS RAMs help to model different non-deterministic approaches. Here, we deal with different types of binary non-determinisms and study the consequences of the decidability of the identity relation and the decidability of finite sets consisting of one or two constants. We compare the binary non-determinism resulting from a non-deterministic branching process, the digital non-determinism resulting from the restriction of guesses to two constants, and some other non-determinisms resulting from the use of Moschovakis' operator applied to oracle sets restricted to tuples of constants. Moreover, we show that the performance capability and the efficiency of individual machines are influenced by the following properties. 1. The identity relation belongs to the underlying structure. 2. The identity is semi-decidable over the underlying structure. 3. Two single-element sets of constants are semi-decidable. 4. A set of two constants is semi-decidable. The order of these properties corresponds to the strength of their influence. In all cases mentioned, the semi-decidability of the sets implies their decidability.</description>

      <title>An ASP-Based Framework for MUSes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.</description>

Abstract: This position paper provides a critical but constructive discussion of current practices in benchmarking and evaluative practices in the field of formal reasoning and automated theorem proving. We take the position that open code, open data, and benchmarks that are complete and error-free will accelerate progress in this field. We identify practices that create barriers to contributing to this field and suggest ways to remove them. We also discuss some of the practices that might produce misleading evaluative information. We aim to create discussions that bring together people from various groups contributing to automated theorem proving, autoformalization, and informal reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Myhill isomorphism theorem does not generalize much</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Myhill isomorphism is a variant of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem. It states that, from two injections that reduces two subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to each other, there exists a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that preserves them. This theorem can be proven constructively. We investigate to which extent the theorem can be extended to other infinite sets other than $\mathbb{N}$. We show that, assuming Markov's principle, the theorem can be extended to the conatural numbers $\mathbb{N}_{\infty}$ provided that we only require that bicomplemented sets are preserved by the bijection. This restriction is essential. Otherwise, the picture is overall negative: among other things, it is impossible to extend that result to either $2 \times \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N} + \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N}_{\infty}^2$, $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ or $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$.</description>

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones, and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical findings in cognitive science.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the module-checking problem of pushdown multi-agent systems (PMS) against ATL and ATL* specifications. We establish that for ATL, module checking of PMS is 2EXPTIME-complete, which is the same complexity as pushdown module-checking for CTL. On the other hand, we show that ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL* model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher than triply exponential-time.</description>

      <title>On Bisimilarity for Quasi-discrete Closure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closure spaces, a generalisation of topological spaces, have shown to be a convenient theoretical framework for spatial model checking. The closure operator of closure spaces and quasi-discrete closure spaces induces a notion of neighborhood akin to that of topological spaces that build on open sets. For closure models and quasi-discrete closure models, in this paper we present three notions of bisimilarity that are logically characterised by corresponding modal logics with spatial modalities: (i) CM-bisimilarity for closure models (CMs) is shown to generalise topo-bisimilarity for topological models and to be an instantiation of neighbourhood bisimilarity, when CMs are seen as (augmented) neighbourhood models. CM-bisimilarity corresponds to equivalence with respect to the infinitary modal logic IML that includes the modality ${\cal N}$ for ``being near to''. (ii) CMC-bisimilarity, with `CMC' standing for CM-bisimilarity with converse, refines CM-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure spaces, carriers of quasi-discrete closure models. Quasi-discrete closure models come equipped with two closure operators, Direct ${\cal C}$ and Converse ${\cal C}$, stemming from the binary relation underlying closure and its converse. CMC-bisimilarity, is captured by the infinitary modal logic IMLC including two modalities, Direct ${\cal N}$ and Converse ${\cal N}$, corresponding to the two closure operators. (iii) CoPa-bisimilarity on quasi-discrete closure models, which is weaker than CMC-bisimilarity, is based on the notion of compatible paths. The logical counterpart of CoPa-bisimilarity is the infinitary modal logic ICRL with modalities Direct $\zeta$ and Converse $\zeta$, whose semantics relies on forward and backward paths, respectively. It is shown that CoPa-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure models relates to divergence-blind stuttering equivalence for Kripke models.</description>

      <title>Aczel-Mendler Bisimulations in a Regular Category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aczel-Mendler bisimulations are a coalgebraic extension of a variety of computational relations between systems. It is usual to assume that the underlying category satisfies some form of the axiom of choice, so that the collection of bisimulations enjoys desirable properties, such as closure under composition. In this paper, we accommodate the definition in general regular categories and toposes. We show that this general definition: 1) is closed under composition without using the axiom of choice, 2) coincides with other types of coalgebraic formulations under milder conditions, 3) coincides with the usual definition when the category satisfies the regular axiom of choice. In particular, the case of toposes heavily relies on power-objects, for which we recover some favourable properties along the way. Finally, we describe several examples in Stone spaces, toposes for name-passing, and modules over a ring.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: distributed collaborative action via topology, algebra, and logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open.
  The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing.
  This monograph presents a comprehensive view of semitopologies which includes point-set semitopology, algebra, and logic inspired by these considerations. This is interesting in and of itself and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Representing Guardedness in Call-by-Value and Guarded Parametrized Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like the notion of computation via (strong) monads serves to classify various flavours of impurity, including exceptions, non-determinism, probability, local and global store, the notion of guardedness classifies well-behavedness of cycles in various settings. In its most general form, the guardedness discipline applies to general symmetric monoidal categories and further specializes to Cartesian and co-Cartesian categories, where it governs guarded recursion and guarded iteration respectively. Here, even more specifically, we deal with the semantics of call-by-value guarded iteration. It was shown by Levy, Power and Thielecke that call-by-value languages can be generally interpreted in Freyd categories, but in order to represent effectful function spaces, such a category must canonically arise from a strong monad. We generalize this fact by showing that representing guarded effectful function spaces calls for certain parametrized monads (in the sense of Uustalu). This provides a description of guardedness as an intrinsic categorical property of programs, complementing the existing description of guardedness as a predicate on a category.</description>

      <title>Formalising the local compactness of the adele ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adele ring of a number field is a central object in modern number theory. Its status as a locally compact topological ring is one of the key reasons why. We describe a formal proof that the adele ring of a number field is locally compact implemented in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Our work includes the formalisations of new types, including the completion of a number field at an infinite place, the infinite adele ring and the finite $S$-adele ring, as well as formal proofs that completions of a number field are locally compact and that their rings of integers at finite places are compact.</description>

      <title>Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>

      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem $R(3, k)$ seeks to determine the smallest value of $n$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on $n$ vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size $k$. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey $R(3, k)$ problem such as $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MathCheck to generate certificates for Ramsey problems $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ (and symmetrically $R(8, 3)$ and $R(9, 3)$) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating an improvement of several orders of magnitude in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves $R(3, 8)$ (resp., $R(8, 3)$) sequentially in 59 hours (resp., in 11 hours), while a SAT-only approach using state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problems $R(3, 9)$ and $R(9, 3)$ we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>Safety, Relative Tightness and the Probabilistic Frame Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic separation logic offers an approach to reasoning about imperative probabilistic programs in which a separating conjunction is used as a mechanism for expressing independence properties. Crucial to the effectiveness of the formalism is the frame rule, which enables modular reasoning about independent probabilistic state. We explore a semantic formulation of probabilistic separation logic, in which the frame rule has the same simple formulation as in separation logic, without further side conditions. This is achieved by building a notion of safety into specifications, using which we establish a crucial property of specifications, called relative tightness, from which the soundness of the frame rule follows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use algorithmic methods from online learning to explore some important objects at the intersection of model theory and combinatorics, and find natural ways that algorithmic methods can detect and explain (and improve our understanding of) stable structure in the sense of model theory. The main theorem deals with existence of $\epsilon$-excellent sets (which are key to the Stable Regularity Lemma, a theorem characterizing the appearance of irregular pairs in Szemer\'edi's celebrated Regularity Lemma). We prove that $\epsilon$-excellent sets exist for any $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ in $k$-edge stable graphs in the sense of model theory (equivalently, Littlestone classes); earlier proofs had given this only for $\epsilon &lt; 1/{2^{2^k}}$ or so. We give two proofs: the first uses regret bounds from online learning, the second uses Boolean closure properties of Littlestone classes and sampling. We also give a version of the dynamic Sauer-Shelah-Perles lemma appropriate to this setting, related to definability of types. We conclude by characterizing stable/Littlestone classes as those supporting a certain abstract notion of majority: the proof shows that the two distinct, natural notions of majority, arising from measure and from dimension, densely often coincide.</description>

      <title>Generically Automating Separation Logic by Functors, Homomorphisms and Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundational verification considers the functional correctness of programming languages with formalized semantics and uses proof assistants (e.g., Coq, Isabelle) to certify proofs. The need for verifying complex programs compels it to involve expressive Separation Logics (SLs) that exceed the scopes of well-studied automated proof theories, e.g., symbolic heap. Consequently, automation of SL in foundational verification relies heavily on ad-hoc heuristics that lack a systematic meta-theory and face scalability issues. To mitigate the gap, we propose a theory to specify SL predicates using abstract algebras including functors, homomorphisms, and modules over rings. Based on this theory, we develop a generic SL automation algorithm to reason about any data structures that can be characterized by these algebras. In addition, we also present algorithms for automatically instantiating the algebraic models to real data structures. The instantiation reuses the algebraic models of component structures and preserves their data abstractions. Case studies on formalized imperative semantics show our algorithm can instantiate the algebraic models automatically for a variety of complex data structures. Experimental results indicate the automatically instantiated reasoners from our generic theory show similar results to the state-of-the-art systems made of specifically crafted reasoning rules. The presented theories, proofs, and the verification framework are formalized in Isabelle/HOL.</description>

      <title>Follow the STARs: Dynamic $\omega$-Regular Shielding of Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.</description>
