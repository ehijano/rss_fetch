      <title>Optical Characterization of Wavelength-shifting and Scintillating-Wavelength-shifting Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.</description>

      <title>Single-shot, spatially resolved spectropolarimetry with stress engineered optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe, and test, a method of obtaining spectrally and spatially sampled Stokes polarimetry measurements based on star test polarimetry enabled by a stress engineered optic (SEO). When the SEO is placed in the pupil plane of an imaging system, the space-variant birefringence of the SEO combined with the intrinsic wavelength dependence of the retardance allows for point spread functions from distinct laser wavelengths to be both spectrally and polarimetrically distinguished in a single frame measurement designed to enable single shot spectropolarimetry of individual laser pulses. In the experiment, the beam is sampled using a lenslet array typical of that used in a Shack-Hartmann sensor with the PSF of each spot relayed to a sensor. Experiments show angular errors as small as 100 mRad on the Poincare sphere, with red and blue measurements outperforming green. Potential applications include polarization sampling of extreme lasers as well as spectropolarimetry of display devices based on liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>A Passive UV-Based System for Discharging the Test Masses of Ground Based Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a passive ultraviolet charge management system for the fused silica test masses in ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to 10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced drive voltages.</description>

      <title>Permanently magnetized axion-photon conversion surface for direct dark matter searches with BRASS-p</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method was recently proposed for axion dark matter searches which employs scalable, permanently magnetized, flat conversion surface (or magnetized converter) generating an electromagnetic signal from dark matter particles passing through them. BRASS-p is an experimental setup which applies this method to direct searches of axion/ALP dark matter in the frequency range from 12 to 18 GHz (corresponding to the range of particle mass from 50 to 74 $\mu$eV. The conversion surface of BRASS-p will consist of 24 individual panels, each containing a 483mm $\times$ 483mm array of high-grade permanent magnets organized in a pattern capable of generating a magnetic field with an average strength of $\approx$ 0.9 T, for the field component parallel to the surface of the panel. This paper describes the development and optimization of a design for these panels and discusses the resulting sensitivity of BRASS-p measurements to the axion/ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks for design optimisation of diamond particle detectors for charged particle fast-tracking at high luminosity hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.</description>

      <title>Peak separation methods for inverse photoelectron spectra: Comparing second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states, owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks. Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability. This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>
