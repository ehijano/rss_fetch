      <title>Eccentric Disks With Self-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter &amp; Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Resolution Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry for Next- Generation In-Situ Space Dust Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic and planetary dust hold vital clues to the chemical evolution of the solar system, yet in situ analysis of their molecular and elemental composition remains technically challenging. Here we present laboratory results from HANKA (High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a compact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a universal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation and plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples representative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass spectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but characteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event sensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve complex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across planetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the detection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables fast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample preparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby missions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system that simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice particles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue experiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a solid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues but also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust detector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an optimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary in space on a spacecraft detecting space dust.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Crossing of Comet 3I/ATLAS's Ion Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During October - November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, will pass upstream of the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft. Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Zero-Velocity Structures in the Pluto-Charon CR3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions. This instability creates ideal intersections for low-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important test case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\mu$ binaries. This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Formation of Planets Interior to in situ Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of hot Jupiters with adjacent planetary companions is small but growing, and inner companions appear to be a nearly ubiquitous outcome within this subset of the exoplanet census. While most hot Jupiters are believed to form via tidal migration, the presence of adjacent companions is not easily explained by this formation mechanism, requiring consideration of additional formation mechanisms such as disk migration and in situ formation. In this work, we explore the possibility of in situ formation for both hot Jupiters and their interior companions. Using numerical simulations performed with the N-body integrator REBOUND, we investigate the growth of interior companions under various assumptions about disk conditions and hot Jupiter final orbital positions. Our results show that if a sufficiently high density of planetary embryos is transported to short orbital radii, it is feasible for both hot Jupiters and their interior companions to form in situ, providing a viable explanation for a subset of observed planetary architectures.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Kernel Phase Interferometry on JWST/MIRI: Prospects for Future Planet Searches Around Post Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.</description>

Abstract: Radial velocity searches may lead to detection of exoplanets at large orbital separations only if long-enough time-series of data are available. Therefore publication of precise measurements collected in the past is very valuable even if not successfully completed with a definitive detection. Here we present 309 precise ($\sigma$RV$\approx$5-7 m s$^{-1}$) multi-epoch radial velocities for 28 stars observed with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectrograph between 2004 and 2013. Based on the observations gathered we present a low mass companion ($m_{p}\sin{i}$ = 10.6 $M_{J}$ in 1887.76 $\pm$ 0.01 d, 4.65 au orbit with $e$ = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.01) to a K giant BD+37 3172 ($M$=3.75$\pm$ 0.86 M$_{\odot}$), and a planetary mass companion (m$_{p}\sin{i}$=0.55 M$_{J}$ in 123.05$\pm$0.04 day, 0.55 au orbit with e=0.73$\pm$0.03) to a K giant BD+42 2315 ($M$=1.38$\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\odot}$). We also present two preliminary detections of new spectroscopic binaries: BD+56 2957 (K5) and HD 236555 (G5).</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Shoreline Revisited: A Metric for Atmospheric Retention Informed by Hydrodynamic Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "cosmic shoreline," a semi-empirical relation that separates airless worlds from worlds with atmospheres as proposed by K. J. Zahnle &amp; D. C. Catling, is now guiding large-scale JWST surveys aimed at detecting rocky exoplanet atmospheres. We expand upon this framework by revisiting the shoreline using existing hydrodynamic escape models applied to Earth-like, Venus-like, and steam atmospheres for rocky exoplanets, and we estimate energy-limited escape rates for CH4 atmospheres. We determine the critical instellation required for atmospheric retention by calculating time-integrated atmospheric mass loss. Our analysis introduces a new metric for target selection in the Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time and refines expectations for rocky planet atmosphere searches. Exploring initial volatile inventory ranging from 0.01% to 1% of planetary mass, we find that its variation prevents the definition of a unique clear-cut shoreline, though nonlinear escape physics can reduce this sensitivity to initial conditions. Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy stellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for atmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models find atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets orbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible for 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation. We caution that our estimates are sensitive to processes with poorly understood dynamics, such as atomic line cooling. Finally, we illustrate how density measurements can be used to statistically test the existence of the cosmic shorelines, emphasizing the need for more precise mass and radius measurements.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Mixture Modeling with Laboratory Near-Infrared Data I: Insights into Compositional Analysis of Europa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths ($\sim$1.2-2.5 $\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025). The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (&gt;80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.</description>

      <title>Limits of Standard Tidal Models at Quaoar: Matching Weywot's Orbit, Missing the Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weywot, Quaoar's small satellite, follows a nearly circular orbit at a distance of 12.9 times Quaoar's diameter and coexists with a compact ring system. Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.</description>

Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01405</link>

Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>
