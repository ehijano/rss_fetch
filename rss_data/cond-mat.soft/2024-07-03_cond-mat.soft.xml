      <title>Assessing Polymer Phase Behavior in Explicit Solvent and with Vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice model for polymer solutions, explicitly incorporating interactions with solvent molecules and the contribution of vacancies. By exploiting the well-known analogy between polymer systems and the $O(n)$-vector spin model in the limit $n \to 0$, we derive an exact field-theoretic expression for the partition function of the system. The latter is then evaluated at the saddle-point, providing a mean-field estimate of the free energy. The resulting expression, which conforms to the Flory-Huggins type, is then used to analyze the system's stability with respect to phase separation, complemented by a numerical approach based on convex hull evaluation. We demonstrate that this simple lattice model can effectively explain the behavior of polymer systems in explicit solvent, which has been predominantly investigated through numerical simulations. This includes both single-chain systems and polymer solutions. Our findings emphasize the fundamental role of vacancies whose presence, rendering the system a ternary mixture, is a crucial factor in the observed phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Chevron patterns in an active nematic liquid crystal film in contact with Smectic A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new mechanism of active matter confinement of a thin, active nematic sample consisting of microtubules, activated by Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), placed between a slab of passive liquid crystal, the compound 8CB, and water. The 8CB slab is kept at a temperature below the phase transition value between the nematic and the smectic A phases. The smectic A molecules are horizontally aligned with an applied magnetic field, with their centers of mass arranged on equally spaced layers perpendicular to the field. The contact with the active nematic prompts flow in the smectic slab, along the direction parallel to the layers. This flow direction is transferred back to the active nematic. We set up a model of such contact flow and make predictions on the experimentally observed pattern, from the point of view of asymptotic, linear and nonlinear analyses. We examine such results within the scope of the principle of minimum energy dissipation of the flow. For analytic convenience, we consider the active nematic confined between two symmetric 8CB slabs, and show that the conclusions still hold when replacing the bottom smectic A substrate with water, as in the experimental setting.</description>

      <title>Experimental exploration of geometric cohesion and solid fraction in columns of highly non-convex Platonic polypods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the stability and solid fraction of columns comprised of highly non-convex particles. These particles are constructed by extruding arms onto the faces of Platonic solids, a configuration we term \emph{Platonic polypods}. We explore the emergence and disappearance of solid-like behavior in the absence of adhesive forces between the particles, referred to as \emph{geometric cohesion}. This investigation is conducted by varying the number of arms of the particles and the thickness of these arms. To accomplish this, columns are assembled by depositing particles within a cylindrical container, followed by the removal of the container to evaluate the stability of the resulting structures. Experiments were carried out using three distinct materials to assess the influence of the friction coefficient between the grains. Our findings reveal that certain granular systems exhibit geometric cohesion, depending on their geometrical and contact properties. Furthermore, we analyze the initial solid fraction of the columns, demonstrating that these arrangements can achieve stability even at highly loose states, which contrasts with traditional granular materials.</description>

      <title>Universal mechanism of shear thinning in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft glassy materials experience a significant reduction in viscosity $\eta$ when subjected to shear flow, known as shear thinning. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law scaling of $\eta$ with the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$, $\eta \propto \dot{\gamma}^{-\nu}$, where the exponent $\nu$ is typically around $0.7$ to $0.8$ across different materials. Two decades ago, the mode coupling theory (MCT) suggested that shear thinning occurs due to the advection. However, it predicts too large $\nu = 1$ (&gt; $0.7$ to $0.8$) and overestimates the onset shear rate by orders of magnitude. Recently, it was claimed that a minute distortion of the particle configuration is responsible for shear thinning. Here we extend the MCT to include the distortion, and find that both advection and distortion contribute to shear thinning, but the latter is dominant. Our formulation works quantitatively for several different glass formers. We explain why shear thinning is universal for many glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging behavior of a mixture of particles in a silo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the clogging behavior observed during the flow of aspherical particles from a silo in the presence of spherical particles of different sizes and proportions using flow visualization experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations. The size of the avalanche, essentially the tendency of clogging, exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the spherical particle volume fraction. For small enough content of spherical particles, the clogging tendency intensifies, whereas it reduces rapidly for high enough spherical particle fractions, with a minimum in between. The non-monotonic behavior is observed to persist over for different spherical particle sizes. The overall behavior is shown to arise due to competing effects between the localized total particle fraction influencing avalanche strength and mean size of the particles exiting the silo, influencing the probability of arch formation.</description>

      <title>Rotational dynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics at low Reynolds numbers experiences recent revival in the fields of biophysics and active matter. While in bulk isotropic fluids it is exhaustively studied, this is less so in anisotropic fluids and in confined situations. Here, we combine the latter two by studying the rotation of a disk-like inclusion in a uniaxially anisotropy, globally oriented, incompressible two-dimensional fluid film. In terms of a perturbative expansion in parameters that quantify anisotropies in viscosity and in additional linear friction with a supporting substrate or other type of confinement, we derive analytical expressions for the resulting hydrodynamic flow and pressure fields as well as for the resistance and mobility coefficients of the rotating disk. It turns out that, in contrast to translational motion, the solutions remain well-behaved also in the absence of the additional linear friction. Comparison with results from finite-element simulations show very good agreement with those from our analytical calculations. Besides applications to describe technological systems, for instance, in the area of microfluidics and thin cells of aligned nematic liquid crystals, our solutions are important for quantitative theoretical approaches to fluid membranes and thin films in general featuring a preferred direction.</description>

      <title>Defect Solutions of the Non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model: Spirals and Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the defect solutions of the Non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH). We find two kinds of defects, spirals with unit magnitude topological charge, and topologically neutral targets. These defects generate radially outward travelling waves and thus break the parity and time-reversal symmetry. For a given strength of non-reciprocity, spirals and targets with unique asymptotic wavenumber and amplitude are selected. We use large-scale simulations to show that at low non-reciprocity $\alpha$, a quenched disordered state evolves into quasi-stationary spiral networks. With increasing $\alpha$, we observe networks composed primarily of targets. Beyond a critical threshold $\alpha_c$, a disorder-order transition from defect networks to travelling waves emerges. The transition is marked by a sharp rise in the global polar order.</description>

      <title>Transient amplification of broken symmetry in elastic snap-through</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A snap-through bifurcation occurs when a bistable structure loses one of its stable states and moves rapidly to the remaining state. For example, a buckled arch with symmetrically clamped ends can snap between an inverted and a natural state as the ends are released. A standard linear stability analysis suggests that the arch becomes unstable to asymmetric perturbations. Surprisingly, our experiments show that this is not always the case: symmetric transitions are also observed. Using experiments, numerics, and a toy model, we show that the symmetry of the transition depends on the rate at which the ends are released with sufficiently fast loading leading to symmetric snap-through. Our toy model reveals that this behavior is caused by a region of the system's state space in which any initial asymmetry is amplified. The system may not enter this region when loaded fast (hence remaining symmetric) but will traverse it for some interval of time when loaded slowly, causing a transient amplification of asymmetry. Our toy model suggests that this behavior is not unique to snapping arches, but rather can be observed in dynamical systems where both a saddle-node and a pitchfork bifurcation occur in close proximity.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Diffusion as a Correlated Random Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean square displacement per collision of a molecule immersed in a gas at equilibrium is given by its mean square displacement between two consecutive collisions (mean square free path) corrected by a prefactor in the form of a series. The $n$-th term of the series is proportional to the mean value of the scalar product $\rb_1 \cdot \rb_{n}$, where $\rb_i$ is the displacement of the molecule between the $(i-1)$-th and $i$-th collisions. Simple arguments are used to obtain approximate expressions for each term. The key finding is that the ratio of consecutive terms in the series closely approximates the so-called mean persistence ratio. Exact expressions for the terms in the series are considered and their ratios for several consecutive terms are calculated for the case of hard spheres, showing an excellent agreement with the mean persistence ratio. These theoretical results are confirmed by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. By summing the series, the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient can be determined using only two quantities: the mean square free path and the mean persistence ratio. A simple and an improved expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ are considered and compared with the so-called first and second Sonine approximations to $D$ as well as with computer simulations of the Boltzmann equation. It is found that the improved diffusion coefficient shows very good agreement with simulation results over all intruder and molecule mass ranges. When the intruder mass is smaller than that of the gas molecules, the improved formula even outperforms the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Wetting on Silicone Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicone is frequently used as a model system to investigate and tune wetting on soft materials. Silicone is biocompatible and shows excellent thermal, chemical, and UV stability. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the surface can be easily varied by several orders of magnitude in a controlled manner. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a popular choice for coating applications such as lubrication, self-cleaning, and drag reduction, facilitated by low surface energy. Aiming to understand the underlying interactions and forces, motivated numerous and detailed investigations of the static and dynamic wetting behavior of drops on PDMS-based surfaces. Here, we recognize the three most prevalent PDMS surface variants, namely liquid-infused (SLIPS/LIS), elastomeric, and liquid-like (SOCAL) surfaces. To understand, optimize, and tune the wetting properties of these PDMS surfaces, we review and compare their similarities and differences by discussing (i) the chemical and molecular structure, and (ii) the static and dynamic wetting behavior. We also provide (iii) an overview of methods and techniques to characterize PDMS-based surfaces and their wetting behavior. The static and dynamic wetting ridge is given particular attention, as it dominates energy dissipation, adhesion, and friction of sliding drops and influences the durability of the surfaces. We also discuss special features such as cloaking and wetting-induced phase separation. Key challenges and opportunities of these three surface variants are outlined.</description>

Abstract: The glassy dynamics of dense active matter have recently become a topic of interest due to their importance in biological processes such as wound healing and tissue development. However, while the liquid-state properties of dense active matter have been studied in relation to the glass transition of active matter, the solid-state properties of active glasses have yet to be understood. In this work, we study the structural fluctuations in the active glasses composed of self-propelled particles. We develop a formalism to describe the solid-state properties of active glasses in the harmonic approximation limit and use it to analyze the displacement fields in the active glasses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of high-frequency normal modes become quasi-static with respect to the active forces, and consequently, excitations of these modes are significantly suppressed. This leads to a violation of the equipartition law, suppression of particle displacements, and the apparent collective motion of active glasses. Overall, our results provide a fundamental understanding of the solid-state properties of active glasses.</description>

      <title>Vapour-liquid phase behaviour of primitive models of ionic liquids confined in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the description of ionic liquids (ILs) confined in a porous medium formed by a matrix of immobile randomly placed uncharged particles. The IL is modelled as an electroneutral mixture of hardsphere anions and flexible linear chain cations, represented by tangentially bonded hard spheres with the charge located on one of the terminal beads. The theory combines a generalization of the scaled particle theory, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the associative mean-spherical approximation and allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the pressure and chemical potentials of the matrix-IL system. Using the theory, we calculate the vapour-liquid phase diagrams for two versions of the IL model, i.e., when the cation is modelled as a dimer and as a chain, in a complete association limit. The effects of the matrix confinement and of the non-spherical shape of the cations on the vapour-liquid phase diagrams are studied.</description>
