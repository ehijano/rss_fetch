      <title>Quantum Spacetime Imprints: The 24-Cell, Standard Model Symmetry and Its Flavor Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work \cite{FaragAli:2024jpo} we outlined an exploratory framework in which the 24-cell acts both as the quantum of spacetime and as a geometric representation of elementary particles. In this paper we provide comprehensive mathematical and phenomenological evidence that deepens and refines this primary model. The symmetry of the 24-cell yields a unified hypercharge functional that reproduces Standard Model hypercharge assignments while ensuring anomaly cancellation. By projecting the vertices of the 24-cell onto a three-dimensional flavor subspace using a Minimal Distortion Principle, an emergent tetrahedral structure appears that gives rise to an effective $A_4$ symmetry in the neutrino sector. Extending this discrete symmetry to its binary double cover $T^\prime$ provides the spinorial representations and intrinsic complex phases needed to generate realistic quark Yukawa textures. Guided by the tenet that spacetime and matter are inextricably linked, our analysis suggests that the intricate flavor mixing of the Standard Model may be a residual imprint of the underlying quantum-geometric nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantifying vacuum-like jets in heavy-ion collisions: a Machine Learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modification of jets by interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma has been extensively established through the comparison of observables computed for samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The presence of vacuum-like jets, jets that experienced little interaction with the Quark Gluon Plasma, in the nucleus-nucleus samples dilutes the overall observed modification hindering the detailed study of the underlying physical mechanisms. The ability to ascertain on a jet-by-jet basis the degree of modification of a jet would be an invaluable step in overcoming this limitation. We consider a Transformer classifier, trained on a low-level representation of jets given by the 4-momenta of all its constituents. We show that the Transformer is able to capture discriminating information not accessible to other architectures which use high-level physical observables as input. The Transformer allows us to identify, in the experimentally relevant case where both medium response and underlying event contamination are accounted for, a class of jets that have been unequivocally modified. Further, we perform a robust estimate of the upper bound for the fraction of jets in nucleus-nucleus collisions that are, for all purposes, indistinguishable from those produced in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Keeping It Renormalizable: Minimal Baryogenesis induced Asymmetric Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many asymmetric dark matter scenarios have been proposed to date. Among them, perhaps the most motivated ones are those in which the dark matter asymmetry is induced from the baryon/lepton asymmetries via chemical equilibration without any new sources of CP violation. However, most of the models put forward along these lines have been excluded by now and/or are based on complicated setups. In this letter, we present a new, simple, and viable scenario. It assumes only two new fields: a scalar singlet and an inert scalar doublet, and is based only on renormalizable interactions, that slowly generate the dark matter asymmetry from the Standard Model Higgs asymmetry. The model allows for the direct detection of dark matter in the upcoming generation of experiments, and the inert doublet is predicted to be light enough to be potentially produced and observed at the LHC and future colliders, $m_{H'}&lt;580\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Simplified Spin Dependence in Dark Matter Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions of dark matter with Standard Model particles can be systematically studied in the language of effective field theories. We investigate dark matter interactions with Standard Model particles, including spin-dependent interactions, for direct detection experiments and demonstrate that, although the scattering rate generally depends on multiple types of material response functions, certain linear combinations of these material response functions vanish if the initial and final electronic states share the same Hamiltonian. We also find that several other response functions vanish in parity-symmetric materials, making these systems as simple as isotropic detectors in some respects. Finally, we present the scattering rate for an anisotropic, possibly chiral detector, for generic dark matter-electron spin interactions. These relations reduce the number of independent response functions needed, thereby simplifying the computational complexity for a broad class of dark matter models. Our results provide a complete and efficient toolkit for analyzing electron recoil signals in diverse detector materials.</description>

      <title>New picture on the mesons mass relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is divided in two parts. In the first three sections we review the meson physics phenomenology, highlighting the history of the pseudoscalar multiplet mass spectra research. Then we propose a new approach for the mass mixing problem exclusively based on a second order phase transition principle. This development leads to new relations among the masses of the mesons in this nonet, which present a nice agreement with measurements. Also the quark constitutions and the mixing angle problem are correctly addressed. Then, after describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking process coming from this phenomenological analysis, we establish a field theory with the necessary elements that could reproduce theoretically such results. This is done in the second part of this work. In the end, our quantum analysis of this field theory shows a compatibility with the phenomenology, which allows for further exploration along this path.</description>

      <title>Top-quark production cross sections at higher perturbative orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present calculations of higher-order corrections to top-quark production via three different processes: the production of a top-antitop pair and a $Z$ boson; single-top quark production in the $s$-channel; and top-antitop production with a Higgs boson. It is shown that the contributions from soft-gluon corrections are numerically dominant and large in all these processes. I present approximate NNLO (aNNLO) and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) cross sections that include soft-gluon corrections added to the exact NLO QCD results. Electroweak corrections through NLO are also included for $t{\bar t}Z$ and $t{\bar t}H$ production. The theoretical predictions are compared to LHC measurements of total cross sections for these processes.</description>

      <title>Valence quark distribution of rho meson using light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the partonic structure of the $\rho$ meson, the lightest spin-$1$ vector meson, within the light-front quark model (LFQM). To explore the sensitivity to model assumptions, we employ two distinct types of spin wave functions in the LFQM. Using light-front helicity wave functions, we derive explicit expressions for the leading-twist and subleading-twist quark parton distribution functions (PDFs), and evolve the leading-twist PDFs to higher scales with next-to-leading order (NLO) Dokshitzer--Gribov--Lipatov--Altarelli--Parisi (DGLAP) evolution. We have also calculated the Mellin moment from the evolved PDFs using a simple neural network frame and compared with available theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we compute the full set of nine leading-twist transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) for the valence quark in the $\rho$ meson, including three tensor TMDs that arise from spin-$1$ tensor polarization of the hadron. Positivity constraints for the PDFs and TMDs are examined within this framework. Our findings highlight the crucial role of tensor polarization in shaping the three-dimensional partonic structure of vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Spin-averaged $B_c$ Spectrum in a Cornell-type Potential Using VMC Baseline and GFMC Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the spin-averaged $B_c$ spectrum is computed in a naive Cornell framework, treating the meson as a nonrelativistic system in a spin-independent potential. The Cornell parameters are calibrated directly to the spin-averaged $B_c$ tower by anchoring the $1S$ centroid and scanning a grid in $(\sigma,\kappa)$, with the additive constant $V_0$ fixed at each point by the experimental ground state mass. The spectrum is obtained with a two stage Monte Carlo approach. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) provides optimized radial trial states with the desired nodal pattern. Fixed node Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) then projects the corresponding ground state energies for each $(n,\ell)$ channel. Controlled scans over the GFMC time step, projection time, walker population, and radial grid identify plateau regions where discretization and projection systematics are quantitatively under control. At a representative best point in the low-RMSE valley, the predicted spin-averaged masses agree with the experimental centroids at the level of a few tens of MeV, and the fitted Cornell parameters are consistent with canonical heavy quarkonium analyses.</description>

      <title>Exclusive semileptonic $B$ decays to the ground and excited states of light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons to the ground, radially and orbitally excited states of light mesons are investigated in the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach. Such decays are very important for the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{ub}|$ and testing the nature of the excited light mesons. The mixing schemes for the isoscalar light mesons are considered. The possible assignment of the experimentally observed excited light mesons to the particular states is discussed. The form factors parameterizing weak decay matrix elements between the initial $B$ meson and final light mesons are calculated with the complete account of the relativistic effects, including contributions of the intermediate negative energy states and relativistic transformations of the meson wave functions from rest to the moving reference frame. As a result the transferred momentum squared, $q^2$, dependence of the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. On the basis of the helicity formalism the decay branching fractions and asymmetry and polarization parameters are calculated. The obtained results for the semileptonic $B$ decays to the ground states of light mesons are confronted with available experimental data. On this basis the value of the $|V_{ub}|$ matrix element is determined. It is found in good agreement with the value extracted from inclusive decays. Predictions for the branching fractions of the semileptonic $B$ decays to radially ($2S$ and $3S$) and orbitally ($1P$ and $2P$) excited light mesons are given. Comparison with the previous calculations is performed. It is found that several decays to the excited light mesons have branching fractions of the order $10^{-4}$ and, thus, they can be measured at existing and future $B$ factories.</description>

      <title>Thermal Leptogenesis in $SO(10)\times U(1)_A$ SUSY GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal leptogenesis within a supersymmetric grand unified theory (SUSY GUT) based on the $SO(10) \times U(1)_A$ symmetry, where both the doublet--triplet splitting problem and the unrealistic Yukawa relations are resolved under the natural assumption that all symmetry-allowed interactions appear with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients. In this framework, the structures of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses are determined entirely by the symmetry. The baryon asymmetry of the Universe is computed taking into account the flavor effects, Higgs asymmetry contributions, and the impact of the second-lightest right-handed neutrino. While the predicted asymmetry is too small when all $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings are set to unity, a moderate enhancement factor $r_1 \sim 5.4$ for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass reproduces the observed baryon asymmetry without spoiling low-energy neutrino data. This corresponds to a suppressed lightest neutrino mass, $m_{\nu_1} \sim (1/r_1) \times (\text{symmetry-determined value})$, typically $m_{\nu_1} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{eV}$. We further explore cases where the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings are $\pm 1$, and find that roughly half of them successfully generate the observed baryon asymmetry for $r_1\leq 11$. Moreover, the others yield results of the correct order of magnitude, although they do not generate the observed Baryon asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that thermal leptogenesis is realized in this $SO(10)\times U(1)_A$ SUSY GUT, establishing a link between the observed baryon asymmetry and predictions for the lightest neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a "dark photosphere" that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Toward a holographic realization of the 2+1-flavor QCD phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully back-reacted Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--flavor model with dynamical light and strange sectors, calibrated to lattice QCD using a machine-learning--assisted spectral method. The model reproduces the 2+1-flavor equation of state and chiral dynamics with quantitative accuracy, and maps the Columbia plot with a tri-critical point at $m_s^{\mathrm{tri}} \simeq 21~\text{MeV}$ and a critical mass $m_c \simeq 0.785~\text{MeV}$, consistent with lattice results. At finite density, it yields a crossover-to-first-order transition and predicts a critical endpoint at $T_C = 75.4~\text{MeV}$ and $\mu_C = 768~\text{MeV}$, within the reach of heavy-ion experiments. These findings establish a unified holographic framework for the QCD phase structure across quark masses and baryon density, providing the first consistent and quantitative description of both deconfinement and chiral transitions within a single holographic model.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of Bc meson in a QCD potential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leptonic and semileptonic decay propertis of Bc mesons are studied in a QCD potential model. The CKM element for the leptonic decay is calculated by evaluating its decay constant. With the help of the Isgur-Wise function, the form factors and the CKM element for semileptonic decay are also calculated. The variation in four-momentum square in the two decays demands two different scales of the strong coupling constant \alpha_s. Thus, a two-scale picture is evident from the study. We compute the decay constant f_p for leptonic decay and form factors for semileptonic decay with two different \alpbda scales in a specific prescription where it is related to the strong coupling \alpha_s. Within the potential model, we find the scale for leptonic decay is \lambda \le 0.150 GeV and for semileptonic decay is \lamda \ge 0.410 GeV.</description>

      <title>An EFT approach to the study of multi-phase criticality scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-phase critical scenarios explain the observed Higgs boson mass scale by the almost simultaneous occurrence of two smoothly connected phases of the theory, which differ by the selected vacuum configuration. A generic prediction of the framework is the presence of a further light scalar state, the dilaton, which naturally couples weakly to the Higgs boson. The implementation of the framework usually requires the presence of a third, heavier state, which plays the role of dark matter and ensures the couplings run so that the multi-phase criticality condition is met. In this paper we consider the multi-phase criticality limit of an extension of the Standard Model including two extra scalar singlets, addressing the scenario with effective field theory methods that are particularly suited for treating the hierarchical mass spectrum that this construction yields. The analysis improves on the approximated results available in the Literature and explores the phenomenology of the model at collider and dark matter experiments. We find that the running of scalar couplings in the EFT between the two scales cannot be ignored, but the quantum corrections from the dark matter candidate are not noticeably modified.</description>

      <title>Effects of Early-Universe Inhomogeneity on Bubble Formation: Primordial Black Holes as an Extreme Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our early Universe is not perfectly homogeneous and it may contain some inhomogeneous sources, which might distort the local spacetime and modify the bubble nucleation rate. Taking the primordial black hole as an extreme example, we investigate the bubble nucleation rate of a first-order phase transition in the vicinity of primordial black holes or other primordial gravitational sources. Our analysis reveals that the presence of primordial black holes can reduce the effective action and might modify the nucleation rate due to their gravitational effects, potentially altering the dynamics of the phase transition in the early universe and producing new gravitational wave signals since the gravitational effects of the primordial black hole or other possible inhomogeneous sources could lead to nucleation of non-spherical symmetric bubbles.</description>

      <title>Double virtual QCD corrections to $t\bar{t}+$jet production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a leading colour computation of the double virtual contributions to top-quark pair production in association with a jet at a hadron collider at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. The finite remainders of the two-loop amplitudes, after subtraction of infrared and ultraviolet divergences, are extracted analytically from evaluations over finite fields by using a (potentially) overcomplete basis of special functions defined through their differential equations. We construct the colour- and spin-summed interference with the tree-level amplitudes and present a \texttt{C++} library suitable for immediate use in phenomenological studies. We present new techniques for the evaluation of the special functions through direct numerical integration of differential equations which perform well across the full physical phase space.</description>

      <title>Higher-order QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of a top-quark pair, the heaviest known elementary particle, in association with a light jet is a key process for studying the properties of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Due to its significance as a signal process with considerable sensitivity to the top-quark mass and as a background process for new physics searches, it is crucial to predict differential cross sections with high precision. In this article, we present, for the first time, predictions for various kinematical observables at next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics. The perturbative behavior is analyzed, and uncertainties arising from missing higher-order contributions are substantially reduced. The necessary two-loop amplitudes have been evaluated in the leading-color approximation, and we provide estimates for the impact of the missing contributions.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0\gamma $ pair in the saturation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0 \gamma$ pair with large invariant mass, as a promising channel to study the effects of gluon saturation. It has recently been demonstrated that this process is incompatible with a collinear factorization approach in terms of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at the leading twist. In such a situation, a (generalized) $k_T$-dependent factorization at small $x$ is a valid alternative approach. We perform this calculation using the shockwave formalism, which resums multiple gluon exchanges between the projectile and the dense nuclear target. We find that the polarized amplitude changes sign as a function of back-to-back transverse momentum $|\vec{p}_t|$ of the pion-photon pair, resulting in a dip-like structure in the fully differential cross section as a function of $|\vec{p}_t|$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the two-loop amplitudes for a self-dual Higgs boson with up to four positive helicity gluons in the heavy top-quark limit. Because the tree amplitudes in the all-plus sector vanish, we can construct simple representations of the polylogarithmic parts of the two-loop amplitudes using four-dimensional unitarity cuts into rational one-loop and tree amplitudes. The remaining rational function ambiguity is extracted from a tensor integral reduction over finite fields. The final expressions are presented using polylogarithms up to weight two and compact rational functions of spinor-helicity products.</description>

      <title>The Light Dark Matter eXperiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter (DM) at colliders is one of the biggest challenges in high-energy physics today. Significant efforts have been made to detect DM within the mass range of 1-10,000 GeV at the Large Hadron Collider and other experiments. However, the lower mass range of 0.001-1 GeV remains largely unexplored, despite strong theoretical motivation from thermal dark matter models in that mass range. The Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) is a proposed fixed-target experiment at SLAC's LCLS-II 8 GeV electron beamline, specifically designed for the direct production of sub-GeV dark matter. The experiment operates on the principle of detecting missing momentum and missing energy signatures. In this talk, we will present the experimental design of LDMX detector and discuss strategies for detecting dark matter. The talk will detail traditional discriminants-based methods using the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as a veto for Standard Model processes. Additionally, the application of advanced machine learning techniques, such as boosted decision trees and graph neural networks, for distinguishing signal from background will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Consistency and Explicit Construction of One-Loop BCJ Numerators of Yang-Mills and Related Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of one-loop BCJ numerators in Yang-Mills and related theories. Starting from the propagator matrix that connects colour-ordered integrands to numerators, we identify the consistency conditions that ensure the existence of Jacobi-satisfying numerator solutions and determine the unique construction. The relation between one-loop numerators and forward-limit tree numerators is clarified, together with the additional physical conditions required for a consistent double-copy interpretation.
  We propose a two-step expansion strategy for obtaining explicit one-loop numerators. The Yang-Mills integrand is first decomposed into scalar-loop Yang-Mills-scalar building blocks, which are then expanded into bi-adjoint scalar integrands. We derive explicit results for up to three external gluons, showing how the kinematic consistency conditions uniquely determine the coefficients in each case. Similar results for Einstein-Yang-Mills and gravity amplitudes are also presented.</description>

      <title>NJL-Chiral Soliton and the Nucleon Equation of State at supra-saturation density: Impact of Chiral Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that, at sufficiently high baryon densities, the equation of state (EoS) of bulk nuclear matter can be identified with that of the nucleon core. In this work, we illustrate how the energy density and pressure distributions inside individual nucleons can be utilized to construct the EoS of supra-dense matter. In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy, small-angle limit of two-body gravitational scattering. Using power counting arguments and dispersion relations in an effective field theory for the Regge regime, we derive the general loop expansion that determines how the leading Regge logarithms and their complex structure arise as a power series in $t/s$. Focusing on the tower of multi-H diagrams that govern the leading logarithmic behavior, we compute the leading double logarithm at four loops (5PM) using both effective field theory methods and the multi-Regge expansion, finding complete agreement. Finally, using the aforementioned dispersion relations, we extract the single logarithmic contribution to the imaginary part of the eikonal phase at 5PM in the Regge limit.</description>

      <title>$CPT$-Symmetric K\"ahler-Dirac Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K\"ahler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model.</description>

      <title>Four-body contributions to B -&gt; Xs gamma at NLO</title>

      <description>arXiv:1411.7677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing efforts to reduce the perturbative uncertainty in the B -&gt; Xs gamma decay rate have resulted in a theory estimate to NNLO in QCD. However, a few contributions from multi-parton final states which are formally NLO are still unknown. These are parametrically small and included in the estimated error from higher order corrections, but must be computed if one is to claim complete knowledge of the B -&gt; Xs gamma rate to NLO. A major part of these unknown pieces are four-body contributions corresponding to the partonic process b -&gt; s qbar q gamma. We compute these NLO four-body contributions to B -&gt; Xs gamma, and confirm the corresponding tree-level leading-order results. While the NLO contributions arise from tree-level and one-loop Feynman diagrams, the four-body phase-space integrations make the computation non-trivial. The decay rate contains collinear logarithms arising from the mass regularization of collinear divergences. We perform an exhaustive numerical analysis, and find that these contributions are positive and amount to no more than 1% of the total rate in the Standard Model, thus confirming previous estimates of the perturbative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Flavor Matters, but Matter Flavors: Matter Effects on Flavor Composition of Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that high-energy astrophysical neutrinos produced in the cores of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can undergo strong matter effects, thus significantly influencing their source flavor ratios. In particular, matter effects can completely modify the standard interpretation of the flavor ratio measurements in terms of the physical processes occurring in the sources (e.g., $pp$ versus $p\gamma$, full pion-decay chain versus muon-damped pion decay). We contrast our results with the existing flavor ratio measurements at IceCube, as well as with projections for next-generation neutrino telescopes like IceCube-Gen2. Signatures of these matter effects in neutrino flavor composition would not only bring more evidence for neutrino production in central AGN regions, but would also be a powerful probe of heavily Compton-thick AGNs, which escape conventional observation in $X$-rays and other electromagnetic wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Type-I Seesaw family of neutrino mass models, including the conventional type-I seesaw and its low-scale variants, namely the linear and inverse seesaws. We establish that all these models essentially correspond to a particular form of the type-I seesaw in the context of explicit lepton number violation. We then focus into the more interesting scenario of spontaneous lepton number violation, systematically categorizing all inequivalent minimal models. Furthermore, we identify and flesh out specific models that feature a rich majoron phenomenology and discuss some scenarios which, despite having heavy mediators and being invisible in processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, predict sizable rates for decays including the majoron in the final state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Type-III scotogenic model by incorporating a real singlet scalar. This scalar plays a crucial role as the inflaton due to its non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. The inflaton field subsequently decays into other particles within the Type-III scotogenic framework. In this framework, the inert scalar doublet and fermion triplet are crucial for neutrino mass generation and present strong candidates for 25\% energy budget or dark matter in the Universe. We study their relic abundance and potential for direct detection. Furthermore, we discuss possible observational signals that could be identified in future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Boosting VBF Reconstruction at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forward muon detection at high-energy muon colliders is crucial for resolving the underlying electroweak process. Detecting these muons is challenging in current detector designs, limited by the shielding required to suppress the beam-induced background. This work proposes using asymmetric beam energies to boost one of the forward muons into the detector acceptance, enhancing the ability to distinguish between $W$- and $Z$-initiated vector boson fusion processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an asymmetric collider using VBF Higgs production at 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with modest boost asymmetries. Asymmetric beam configurations can partially recover the physics potential lost in forward regions when detector coverage is limited.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo ($\nu$DSMC) is a Monte Carlo method for solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the early Universe, designed to track the evolution of cosmic neutrinos across a wide range of cosmological scenarios. We develop a complete $\nu$DSMC solver that consistently incorporates the effects of the electron mass, three-flavour neutrino oscillations, and finite-temperature QED corrections to the thermodynamics of the electromagnetic plasma. As a first application, we perform a high-precision calculation of neutrino decoupling in the standard cosmological model and obtain $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.0439 \pm 0.0006$, in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Data-driven analyses and model-independent fits for present $b\to s \ell \ell$ results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a critical assessment of the present $B$ anomalies in the exclusive $b \to s \ell\ell$ mode based on the QCD factorisation (QCDf) approach. In particular, we analyse the impact of different local form factor calculations and of the largest bin in the low-$q^2$ region. We also present a model-independent analysis of the new results of the LHCb and CMS experiments on the $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ angular observables. In addition, we update the global fit by including all $b \to s$ observables incorporating the new data from CMS and LHCb. In these analyses, we use 10% or higher guesstimates of the non-factorisable power corrections as additional uncertainties, serving as a placeholder for robust estimates of these contributions. Updating earlier results, we also analyse the combined LHCb and CMS data on the $B \to K^* \mu^+\mu^-$ angular observables using data-driven approaches to find indications whether these tensions between the QCDf predictions and the present data are due to underestimated subleading hadronic contributions or due to new physics effects.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the newly proposed tetraquark Regge trajectory relations, we investigate three series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ with $q,q'=u,d,s$: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other two series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories cannot be obtained by simply imitating meson Regge trajectories, because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, the tetraquarks' structure and substructure must be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories would have to rely solely on fitting existing theoretical results or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and string tension would become unobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by simple fitted formulas. For the bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$, $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{1/2}$ $(x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2)$, whereas $\lambda$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$ $(x=N_{r},L)$. All three series of trajectories display concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the confining potential is linear. This conclusion holds irrespective of whether light-quark masses are included, owing to the large masses of the heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Hadronic tensor molecule $B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass and full decay width of the hadronic tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}=B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$ are examined in the framework of QCD sum rule method. To find the mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this state, we use the two-point sum rules. The result $(12.87 \pm 0.08)~\mathrm{ GeV}$ for $m$ indicates that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ can easily decay to pairs of $J/\psi \Upsilon $, $\eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, and $ B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ mesons. Kinematically permitted ways for $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ to transform to conventional mesons include also processes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast)-}$ triggered by annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ quarks in the molecule. The decays to meson pairs $B^{(\ast)+}B^{(\ast )-}$, $B^{(\ast )0}\overline{B}^{(\ast )0}$ , and $B_{s}^{(\ast)0}\overline{B}_{s}^{(\ast )0}$ generated by $c\overline{c } \to $ light quarks are also among possible channels of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$. Technical tools of the three-point sum rule approach are applied to compute partial widths of these decays. Our results for the mass and width $\Gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}}=(154 \pm 19)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are important for experimental studies of fully heavy exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Decay and production properties of strange double charm pentaquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the decay and production properties of the strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ with strangeness $S=-1$. Building upon our previous work predicting its $J^P=1/2^-$ molecular configuration, we employ three-point QCD sum rules to calculate its strong decay widths and estimate its production branching ratios via $\Xi_{bc}^+$ baryon decays. The total strong decay width into the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and $\Omega_{cc}\pi$ final-state channels is determined as $84.58^{+19.25}_{-18.80}$ MeV. Furthermore, using a rescattering mechanism, we analyze the $\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D_s^{\ast-}\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++}$ process and estimate the production branching ratio to be $\mathcal{B}r(\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++})=(4.32_{-1.47}^{+2.02})\times10^{-6}$. The relatively narrow width and detectable branching ratio suggest that this pentaquark state could be observed in experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Magnetometer Search for Ultralight Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Single-Site, Two-Sensor Array: A 6-Channel DTFT Likelihood Analysis with Scalar Optically Pumped Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a laboratory search for ultralight dark photon dark matter using a single-site, two-sensor scalar magnetometer array. The experiment employs two scalar optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) operated in a differential configuration to suppress common-mode noise and enhance sensitivity to spatially coherent dark photon fields. We analyze 10.5 hours of continuous data with a six-channel complex data vector evaluated at the three physical frequencies of the expected dark photon signal triplet. Assuming Gaussian noise, we develop a likelihood framework to set robust, frequency-resolved upper limits on the kinetic-mixing parameter $\varepsilon$, which governs the coupling between Standard Model photons and dark photons. Within the mass range $4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_{A'} \leq 3\times10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, we obtain the most stringent direct laboratory limits to date on $\varepsilon$, complementing existing astrophysical bounds including those inferred from observations of the Leo-T dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium align with the CMS prediction within the corresponding uncertainty range. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global analysis of collider and fixed-target experimental data and calculations from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are used to gain complementary information on the structure of hadrons. We propose novel ``window observables'' that allow for higher precision cross-validation between the different approaches, a critical step for studies that wish to combine the datasets. Global analyses are limited by the kinematic regions accessible to experiment, particularly in a range of Bjorken-$x$, and lattice QCD calculations also have limitations requiring extrapolations to obtain the parton distributions. We provide two different ``window observables'' that can be defined within a region of $x$ where extrapolations and interpolations in global analyses remain reliable and where lattice QCD results retain sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will, perhaps unsurprisingly, prove very challenging. However, with dedicated instrumentation at a second EIC detector, the measurement may be possible.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos</title>

Abstract: Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II. Resonant Conversions in the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second part in a pair of papers forecasting the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to dark photons, a highly motivated, simple extension of the Standard Model. Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as low as $10^{-8}$.</description>
