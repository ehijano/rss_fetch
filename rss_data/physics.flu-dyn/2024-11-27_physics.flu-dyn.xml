      <title>Finite Volume Physical Informed Neural Network (FV-PINN) with Reduced Derivative Order for Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) has evolved into a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations, which has been applied to various fields such as energy, environment, en-gineering, etc. When utilizing PINN to solve partial differential equations, it is common to rely on Automatic Differentiation (AD) to compute the residuals of the governing equations. This can lead to certain precision losses, thus affecting the accuracy of the network prediction. This paper pro-poses a Finite Volume Physics-Informed Neural Network (FV-PINN), designed to address steady-state problems of incompressible flow. This method divides the solution domain into mul-tiple grids. Instead of calculating the residuals of the Navier-Stokes equations at collocation points within the grid, as is common in traditional PINNs, this approach evaluates them at Gaussian in-tegral points on the grid boundaries using Gauss's theorem. The loss function is constructed using the Gaussian integral method, and the differentiation order for velocity is reduced. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we predict the velocity and pressure fields for two typical examples in fluid topology optimization. The results are compared with commercial software COMSOL, which indicates that FVI-PINN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of both the velocity and pressure fields while accelerating the training speed of the network.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of flow sensing in plankton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planktonic organisms, despite their passive drift in the ocean, exhibit complex responses to fluid flow, including escape behaviors and larval settlement detection. But what flow signals can they perceive? This paper addresses this question by considering an organism covered with sensitive cilia and immersed in a background flow. The organism is modeled as a spherical particle in Stokes flow, with cilia assumed to measure the local shear at the particle surface. This study reveals that, while these organisms can always measure certain components of the flow strain, bottom-heaviness is necessary to measure the horizontal component of vorticity. These findings shed light on flow sensing by plankton, contributing to a better understanding of their behavior.</description>

      <title>Scale-space energy transport in anisotropic inhomogeneous buoyancy-driven turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new mathematical framework that can describe the budget of turbulence kinetic energy and heat transfer in both physical space and scale space of turbulence. We derived two exact transport equations for inhomogeneous and anisotropic buoyancy-driven incompressible turbulent flow. The two equations are the turbulent kinetic energy transport equation and the turbulent heat flux density transport equation. These equations are derived from the governing Navier-Stokes equation and two-point correlations. Analogous to the energy spectrum and heat flux spectrum for homogeneous isotropic turbulence, energy density, and heat flux density introduced in this paper describe the energy and heat flux corresponding in various scales and the transport across physical and scale space for inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulent flows. The proposed equations are used to post-process a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection flow dataset. Specifically, production, dissipation, interscale transport, and buoyancy terms are evaluated, and the contribution from inhomogeneity is quantified.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the textural atomization process of a rocket engine assisted coaxial jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for analyzing liquid ligaments of a textural atomization process is presented in this article for the case of a rocket engine type assisted atomization process under combustion. The operating point positions the atomization process in the fiber type regime carrying an intense textural atomization process. Multiscale in nature, the method based on image analysis associates a scale distribution with a family of ligaments, this distribution being sensitive to the number, size and shape of these ligaments. The quality of scale distributions measured by image analysis depends on the spatial resolution and the precision of area measurements of surfaces with curved boundaries but described by square pixels. Part of the work consisted of improving the method for measuring scale distributions by using a subpixel image analysis technique and refining the surface area measurement method. Another part directed the multiscale analysis towards the estimation of the diameter distributions of the blobs that characterize the large-scale deformation of the ligaments. The analysis describes the atomization process at a level of detail never reached. For instance, assuming that the blobs are drops in formation, the estimated diameter distribution (bimodal in the case examined here) as well as the number of these drops are evaluated as a function of the distance from the injector. This information indicates where the process is most intense and where it stops. Furthermore, these diameter distributions receive a mathematical expression whose parameters report clear evolutions with the distance from the injector. This shows the possibility of elaborating mathematical models appropriate for textural atomization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>LC-SVD-DLinear: A low-cost physics-based hybrid machine learning model for data forecasting using sparse measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel methodology that integrates singular value decomposition (SVD) with a shallow linear neural network for forecasting high resolution fluid mechanics data. The method, termed LC-SVD-DLinear, combines a low-cost variant of singular value decomposition (LC-SVD) with the DLinear architecture, which decomposes the input features-specifically, the temporal coefficients-into trend and seasonality components, enabling a shallow neural network to capture the non-linear dynamics of the temporal data. This methodology uses under-resolved data, which can either be input directly into the hybrid model or downsampled from high resolution using two distinct techniques provided by the methodology. Working with under-resolved cases helps reduce the overall computational cost. Additionally, we present a variant of the method, LC-HOSVD-DLinear, which combines a low-cost version of the high-order singular value decomposition (LC-HOSVD) algorithm with the DLinear network, designed for high-order data. These approaches have been validated using two datasets: first, a numerical simulation of three-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at $Re = 220$; and second, an experimental dataset of turbulent flow passing a circular cylinder at $Re = 2600$. The combination of these datasets demonstrates the robustness of the method. The forecasting and reconstruction results are evaluated through various error metrics, including uncertainty quantification. The work developed in this article will be included in the next release of ModelFLOWs-app</description>

      <title>Helical locomotion in dilute suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of understanding the effect of media heterogeneity on the swimming dynamics of flagellated bacteria, we study the rotation and swimming of rigid helices in dilute suspensions experimentally and theoretically. We first measure the torque experienced by, and thrust force generated by, helices rotating without translating in suspensions of neutrally buoyant particles with varying concentrations and sizes. Using the ratio of thrust to drag forces $\xi$ as an empirical proxy for propulsion efficiency, our experiments indicate that $\xi$ increases with the concentration of particles in the fluid, with the enhancement depending strongly on the geometric parameters of the helix. To rationalize these experimental results, we then develop a dilute theoretical approach that accounts for the additional hydrodynamic stress generated by freely suspended spheres around the helical tail. We predict similar enhancements in the drag coefficient ratio and propulsion at a given angular speed in a suspension and study its dependence on the helix geometry and the spatial distribution of the suspended spheres. These results are further reinforced by experiments on freely swimming artificial swimmers, which propel faster in dilute suspensions, with speed increases over $60 \%$ for optimal geometries. Our findings quantify how biological swimmers might benefit from the presence of suspended particles, and could inform the design of artificial self-propelled devices for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Flame-wall interaction of thermodiffusively unstable hydrogen/air flames -- Part I: Characterization of governing physical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen combustion systems operated under fuel-lean conditions offer great potential for low emissions. However, these operating conditions are also susceptible to intrinsic thermodiffusive combustion instabilities. Even though technical combustors are enclosed by walls that significantly influence the combustion process, intrinsic flame instabilities have mostly been investigated in canonical freely-propagating flame configurations unconfined by walls. This study aims to close this gap by investigating the flame-wall interaction of thermodiffusive unstable hydrogen/air flame through detailed numerical simulations in a two-dimensional head-on quenching configuration. It presents an in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the quenching process, revealing the major impact factors of the instabilities on the quenching characteristics. The thermodiffusive instabilities result in lower quenching distances and increased wall heat fluxes compared to one-dimensional head-on quenching flames under similar operation conditions. The change in quenching characteristics seems not to be driven by kinematic effects. Instead, the increased wall heat fluxes are caused by the enhanced flame reactivity of the unstable flame approaching the wall, which results from mixture variations associated with the instabilities. Overall, the study highlights the importance of studying flame-wall interaction in more complex domains than simple one-dimensional configurations, where such instabilities are inherently suppressed. Further, it emphasizes the need to incorporate local mixture variations induced by intrinsic combustion instabilities in combustion models for flame-wall interactions. In part II of this study, the scope is expanded to gas turbine and internal combustion engine relevant conditions through a parametric study, varying the equivalence ratio, pressure, and unburnt temperature.</description>

      <title>A generalised novel loss function for computational fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive, aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis, assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained; optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an 83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Haptic-Based Proximity Sensing System for Buried Object in Granular Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximity perception of objects in granular materials is significant, especially for applications like minesweeping. However, due to particles' opacity and complex properties, existing proximity sensors suffer from high costs from sophisticated hardware and high user-cost from unintuitive results. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective proximity sensing system for underground stuff based on the haptic feedback of the sensor-granules interaction. We study and employ the unique characteristic of particles -- failure wedge zone, and combine the machine learning method -- Gaussian process regression, to identify the force signal changes induced by the proximity of objects, so as to achieve near-field perception. Furthermore, we design a novel trajectory to control the probe searching in granules for a wide range of perception. Also, our proximity sensing system can adaptively determine optimal parameters for robustness operation in different particles. Experiments demonstrate our system can perceive underground objects over 0.5 to 7 cm in advance among various materials.</description>

      <title>Controlled angular momentum injection in a magnetically levitated He II droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphology of rotating viscous classical liquid droplets has been extensively studied and is well understood. However, our understanding of rotating superfluid droplets remains limited. For instance, superfluid $^4$He (He II) can carry angular momentum through two distinct mechanisms: the formation of an array of quantized vortex lines, which induce flows resembling classical solid-body rotation, and surface traveling deformation modes associated with irrotational internal flows. These two mechanisms can result in significantly different droplet morphologies, and it remains unclear how the injected angular momentum is partitioned between them. To investigate this complex problem experimentally, one must first levitate an isolated He II droplet using techniques such as magnetic levitation. However, an outstanding challenge lies in effectively injecting angular momentum into the levitated droplet. In this paper, we describe a magneto-optical cryostat system designed to levitate He II droplets and present the design of a time-dependent, non-axially symmetric electric driving system. Based on our numerical simulations, this system should enable controlled angular momentum injection into the droplet. This study lays the foundation for future investigations into the morphology of rotating He II droplets.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of dilute polymeric fluids with memory effects in the turbulent flow regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the numerical challenge of solving the Hookean-type time-fractional Navier--Stokes--Fokker--Planck equation, a history-dependent system of PDEs defined on the Cartesian product of two $d$-dimensional spaces in the turbulent regime. Due to its high dimensionality, the non-locality with respect to time, and the resolution required to resolve turbulent flow, this problem is highly demanding. To overcome these challenges, we employ the Hermite spectral method for the configuration space of the Fokker--Planck equation, reducing the problem to a purely macroscopic model. Considering scenarios for available analytical solutions, we prove the existence of an optimal choice of the Hermite scaling parameter. With this choice, the macroscopic system is equivalent to solving the coupled micro-macro system. We apply second-order time integration and extrapolation of the coupling terms, achieving, for the first time, convergence rates for the fully coupled time-fractional system independent of the order of the time-fractional derivative. Our efficient implementation of the numerical scheme allows turbulent simulations of dilute polymeric fluids with memory effects in two and three dimensions. Numerical simulations show that memory effects weaken the drag-reducing effect of added polymer molecules in the turbulent flow regime.</description>

      <title>Suppression of hyperuniformity in hydrodynamic scalar active field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coarsening dynamics at late times in phase-separating systems lead to universally hyperuniform patterns. This is well known for scalar field theories, such as the Cahn-Hilliard equation, but has also been shown for dry scalar active field theories. We demonstrate the role of hydrodynamic interactions in influencing hyperuniformity in a wet active system described by active model H. Our direct numerical simulations reveal that, while (passive) model H shows hyperuniformity in the coarsening regime, the interplay of activity and hydrodynamic interactions suppresses hyperuniformity in active model H, especially when the activity generates contractile stress in the fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of coalescence of aqueous droplet pairs under an electric field is quantitatively studied using microfluidics in quiescent conditions. We experimentally trap droplet pairs and apply electric fields with varying frequencies and formulation compositions. We find that the electrical resistance of the oil used as continuous phase controls the onset of electrocoalescence in quiescent conditions. We observe that the local field enhancement between droplets strongly depends on formulations but also on the number of droplets across the electrodes. These findings provide a better understanding of the onset of electrocoalescence and pave a route towards the rationalization of droplet-based microfluidics operations.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistics of longitudinal and transverse structure functions, as well as velocity circulation in the inverse energy cascade of two-dimensional turbulence. By means of direct numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we show that transverse structure functions exhibit an anomalous scaling, in contrast to the self-similar behavior of longitudinal ones. We derive an analytical relation that shows that the scaling exponents of transverse structure functions and velocity circulation are related in two-dimensional turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Neural refractive index field: Unlocking the Potential of Background-oriented Schlieren Tomography in Volumetric Flow Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Regularized 13-Moment Equations with Onsager Boundary Conditions in the Linear Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the time-dependent regularized 13-moment equations for general elastic collision models under the linear regime. Detailed derivation shows the proposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the moment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager boundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of undesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows is conducted to verified our model.</description>
