      <title>Explicit polynomial bounds on Dehn functions of subgroups of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999 Brady constructed the first example of a non-hyperbolic finitely presented subgroup of a hyperbolic group by fibring a non-positively curved cube complex over the circle. We show that his example has Dehn function bounded above by $n^{96}$. This provides the first explicit polynomial upper bound on the Dehn function of a finitely presented non-hyperbolic subgroup of a hyperbolic group. We also determine the precise hyperbolicity constant for the $1$-skeleton of the universal cover of the cube complex in Brady's construction with respect to the $4$-point condition for hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Continuity of asymptotic entropy on wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of asymptotic entropy as a function of the step distribution for non-degenerate probability measures with finite entropy on wreath products $ A \wr B = \bigoplus_B A \rtimes B $, where $A$ is any countable group and $B$ is a countable hyper-FC-central group that contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. As one step in proving the above, we show that on any countable group $G$ the probability that the $\mu$-random walk on $G$ never returns to the identity is continuous in $\mu$, for measures $\mu$ such that the semigroup generated by the support of $\mu$ contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. Finally, we show that among random walks on a group $G$ that admit a separable completely metrizable space $X$ as a model for their Poisson boundary, the weak continuity of the associated harmonic measures on $X$ implies the continuity of the asymptotic entropy. This result recovers the continuity of asymptotic entropy on known cases, such as Gromov hyperbolic groups and acylindrically hyperbolic groups, and extends it to new classes of groups, including linear groups and groups acting on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>On finite groups in which some maximal invariant subgroups have indices a prime or the square of a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $G$ be finite groups such that $A$ acts coprimely on $G$ by automorphisms, we first prove some results on the solvability of finite groups in which some maximal $A$-invariant subgroups have indices a prime or the square of a prime. Our results generalize Hall's theorem and some other known results. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterization of finite groups in which every non-nilpotent maximal $A$-invariant subgroup that contains the normalizer of some $A$-invariant Sylow subgroup has index a prime.</description>

      <title>On acylindrical tree actions and outer automorphism group of Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores acylindrical actions on trees, building on previous works related to mapping class groups and projection complexes. We demonstrate that the quotient action of an acylindrical action of a group on a tree by an equivariant family of subgroups remains acylindrical. We establish criteria for ensuring that this quotient action is non-elementary acylindrical, thus preserving acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group. Additionally, we show that the fundamental group of a graph of groups admits the largest acylindrical action on its Bass-Serre tree under certain conditions. As an application, we analyze the outer automorphism group of non-solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, we prove its acylindrical hyperbolicity, highlighting the differences between various tree actions and identifying the largest acylindrical action.</description>

      <title>Fundamental polytope for the isometry group of an alcove</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental alcove $\mathcal{A}$ is a tile in a paving of a vector space $V$ by an affine reflection group $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$. Its geometry encodes essential features of $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$, such as its affine Dynkin diagram $\widetilde{D}$ and fundamental group $\Omega$. In this article we investigate its full isometry group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$. It is well known that the isometry group of a regular polyhedron is generated by hyperplane reflections on its faces. Being a simplex, an alcove $\mathcal{A}$ is the simplest of polyhedra, nevertheless it is seldom a regular one. In our first main result we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Aut}(\widetilde{D})$. Building on this connection, we establish that $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is an abstract Coxeter group, with generators given by affine isometric involutions of the ambient space. Although these involutions are seldom reflections, our second main result leverages them to construct, by slicing the Komrakov--Premet fundamental polytope $\mathcal{K}$ for the action of $\Omega$, a family of fundamental polytopes for the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ on $\mathcal{A}$, whose vertices are contained in the vertices of $\mathcal{K}$ and whose faces are parametrized by the so-called balanced minuscule roots, which we introduce here. In an appendix, we discuss some related negative results on stratified centralizers and equivariant triangulations.</description>

      <title>Sets preserved by a large subgroup of the special linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a subset of the the affine plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We bound the size of the subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that preserves $E$. As a consequence, we show that if $E$ has size $\ll q^\alpha$ and is preserved by $\gg q^\beta$ elements of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ with $\beta\geq 3\alpha/2$, then $E$ is contained in a line. This result is sharp in general, and will be proved by using a point-line incidence bound in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$.</description>

      <title>Fields of definition for triangle groups as Fuchsian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact hyperbolic triangle group $\Delta(p,q,r)$ admits a canonical representation to $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$ with discrete image which is unique up to conjugation. The trace field of this representation is \[K = \mathbf{Q}(\cos(\pi/p), \cos(\pi/q), \cos(\pi/r)).\] We prove that there are exactly eleven such groups which are conjugate to subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(K)$. Moreover, we prove that there are no additional compact hyperbolic triangle groups which are conjugate to subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(L)$ for any totally real field $L$. This answers a question first raised by Waterman and Machlachlan, and also resolves (in the positive) five (interrelated) recent conjectures of McMullen.</description>

      <title>Lifting subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}_2$ to $\mathrm{SL}_2$ over local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a non-archimedean local field. We show that discrete subgroups without 2-torsion in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(K)$ can always be lifted to $\mathrm{SL}_2(K)$, and provide examples (when $\mathrm{char}(K) \neq 2$) which cannot be lifted if either of these conditions is removed. We also briefly discuss lifting representations of groups into $\mathrm{PSL}_2(K)$ to $\mathrm{SL}_2(K)$.</description>

      <title>Lie theoretic approach to unitary groups of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Robert's [26], we study the structure of unitary groups and groups of approximately inner automorphisms of unital $C^*$-algebras, taking advantage of the former being Banach-Lie groups. For a given unital $C^*$-algebra $A$, we provide a description of the closed normal subgroup structure of the connected component of the identity of the unitary group, denoted by $U_A$, resp. of the subgroup of approximately inner automorphisms induced by the connected component of the identity of the unitary group, denoted by $V_A$, in terms of perfect ideals, i.e. ideals admitting no characters. When the unital algebra is locally AF, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between closed normal subgroups of $V_A$ and perfect ideals of the algebra, which can be in the separable case conveniently described using Bratteli diagrams; in particular showing that every closed normal subgroup of $V_A$ is perfect. We also characterize unital $C^*$-algebras $A$ such that $U_A$, resp. $V_A$ are topologically simple, generalizing the main results from [26]. In the other way round, under certain conditions, we characterize simplicity of the algebra in terms of the structure of the unitary group. This in particular applies to reduced group $C^*$-algebras of discrete groups and we show that when $A$ is a reduced group $C^*$-algebra of a non-amenable countable discrete group, then $A$ is simple if and only if $U_A/\mathbb{T}$ is topologically simple.</description>
