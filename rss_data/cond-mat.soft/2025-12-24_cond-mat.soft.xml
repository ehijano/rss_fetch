      <title>On the problem of simple shear of an incompressible viscoelastic solid under finite deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a viscoelastic material model, whose constitutive relation is given by a one-parameter family of Gordon-Schowalter derivatives, the problem of simple shear under acceleration and random velocity motion is considered. For motion with acceleration, the presence of non-zero normal stresses is discovered, which corresponds to the Poynting effect previously discovered for this material. A problem in which the shear rate was determined as a linear function of a random variable given from a normal distribution was studied. Within the framework of the methodology proposed by V.A. Lomakin, an analytical solution of the problem is constructed. A significant dependence of the dispersion of the stress tensor components on the choice of the objective derivative was found.</description>

      <title>An exact dimension-reduced dynamic theory for developable surfaces and curve-fold origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curve-fold origami, composed of developable panels joined along a curved crease, exhibits rich dynamic behaviors relevant to metamaterials and soft robotic systems. Despite multiple approximated models, a comprehensive and exact dynamical theory for curve-fold origami remains absent, limiting the precise predictions of its dynamics, especially for those with wide panels. In this work, we develop an exact dimension-reduced theory that focuses on the dynamics of curve-fold origami, utilizing the intrinsic one-dimensional nature of developable surfaces. Starting from a single developable surface, we investigate the kinematics and kinetic energy of a moving developable surface. By overcoming the difficulty of describing the motion of local frames, we derive the exact velocity field of wide surfaces solely described by the motion of the reference curve, which leads to the kinetic energy of the entire surface. Owing to the one-dimensional feature, the Lagrangian of the system, composed of both kinetic and elastic energy, is a functional of the reference curve. Thus, we may variate the Lagrangian and derive a nonlinear dynamical theory for the reference curve, which comprises governing equations similar to the rod model but can precisely describe the motion of developable surfaces. The theory is validated consistently in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks and is further extended to curved-fold origami modeled as a coupled bi-rod system. Utilizing our exact 1D model, we theoretically analyze the dynamical behaviors of various developable structures, revealing that the coupling of curvature and torsion along with the motion of local frames in our theory leads to the accurate modeling of arbitrarily deformed developable surfaces, which are validated by finite element analysis quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Onsager's Real Cavity model near solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extended Onsager real-cavity framework to describe the Casimir-Polder interaction of small molecules dissolved in dielectric liquids near planar interfaces. By analytically resolving the geometry of the cavity opening, we derive a closed expression that arises when the molecule approaches a surface and connects them smoothly to the asymptotic medium-assisted interaction. Using experimentally established dielectric functions for water, propanol, and PTFE together with accurate molecular polarisabilities for O2 and N2, we compute the full distance-dependent potential for four molecule (O2 and N2)-liquid (water and propanol)-surface (PTFE) combinations. The results reveal how local-field screening inside the cavity, molecular polarisability, and liquid permittivity jointly determine the magnitude and shape of the interaction, including the characteristic transition from the open cavity (small separations) and closed cavity (large separations). The framework provides a transparent baseline for dispersion forces in liquids, while highlighting limitations associated with the point-dipole description, the absence of repulsive contributions, and the breakdown of the dipole approximation at ultrashort separations.</description>

      <title>Composition-agnostic prediction of self-assembly in multicomponent amphiphile mixtures from molecular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting self-assembly in multi-component amphiphilic systems is challenging due to the complexity of intercomponent interactions and the combinatorial growth of possible formulations. In this study, we develop a unified machine-learning framework that directly predicts self-assembly behavior from the molecular structures of constituent components, independent of the number or identity of those components. We extend the critical packing parameter (CPP) to multi-component systems and generate a large dataset of self-assembled morphologies using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations. By systematically evaluating twelve combinations of feature extraction methods and model architectures, we find that models incorporating a fully connected graph convolutional network (GCN) layer achieve superior performance, with the GCN-GCN architecture accurately capturing both intramolecular relationships and intercomponent interactions. Notably, this model exhibits strong extrapolative capability: it accurately predicts CPP values for five-component mixtures even when trained only on systems with fewer components, and it maintains high accuracy for mixtures composed of molecular species that are entirely absent from the training data. These results demonstrate that a composition-agnostic predictive framework can enable efficient virtual screening and provide a foundation for the rational design of complex amphiphilic materials.</description>

      <title>On the chemo-thermo-mechanics of constrained reactive mixtures of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the classical chemo-mechanical theory of Larch{\'e} and Cahn for equilibrium, numerous studies have investigated the transport of species in solids, with or without trapping phenomena. In most applications -- such as the swelling of hydrogels, hydrogen embrittlement in metals, and the transport of lithium or sodium in battery electrodes -- the formation of a new phase or compound can be directly associated with the concentration of the diffusing species. In the present work, we focus on the formation of solid mixtures made of multiple compounds, each characterized by its own volumetric expansion coefficient. Such a scenario arises, for instance, during the sodiation of tin anodes, among other systems. The classical chemo-mechanical framework is naturally recovered as a particular case of the proposed formulation. The theoretical framework developed herein elucidates and differentiates the concepts of phases and flowing species, while establishing rigorous connections between them. The present note is restricted to the general formulation of the governing equations, whereas application-specific developments will be addressed in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <title>The extraordinary importance of self-avoiding behavior in two-dimensional polymers: Insights from large-deviation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent work pointed out the usefulness of taking a large-deviation perspective when trying to extract anything resembling a macroscopic order parameter from a computer simulation. In this paper we note that the end-to-end distance of polymers is such an order parameter. The presence of long-ranged excluded volume interactions leads to significant qualitative differences between the conformations of two- and three-dimensional polymers, some of which are difficult to quantify in computer simulations of realistic (off-lattice) polymer models. But we show here that phenomena such as the greatly enlarged non-Hooke's-law elasticity present in 2D are straightforward to extract from simulation using a large-deviation framework - even though simulating that nonlinearity is tantamount to simulating a 4th order susceptibility. The large-deviation perspective includes both a set of thermodynamic-like tools suitable for studying finite-size systems and a realization that an accurate description of the system's average behavior needs to be consistent with how improbably large fluctuations would behave in that system. The latter is key because strong correlations are absent in this asymptotic large fluctuation regime, so the regime's far-reaching effects can be analytically incorporated into the analysis of simulation data. That, in turn, allows us to direct the efforts of simulations away from difficult-to-sample rare-event domains. We illustrate this point with two- and three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations (and exact results) on two models of a single isolated polymer chain: a chain of linked hard spheres, which has long-ranged excluded volume effects, and a discretized worm-like chain, which does not.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of anisotropic active plates with applications to cell alignment on curved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general continuum mechanics framework for active anisotropic plates within the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an limit, incorporating a preferential direction and inelastic active contractions in geometrically nonlinear plate theory. Through asymptotic expansion, we derive coupled equilibrium equations for plates with transversely isotropic and possibly inhomogeneous reinforcement undergoing spatially varying active contractions through their thickness. The framework highlights the coupling between material anisotropy and active deformations, with target curvatures that compete with imposed geometric constraints. To demonstrate its capabilities, we apply the model to curvature-induced cell alignment, where substrate geometry, cytoskeletal anisotropy, and contractility interact to determine orientation. For cylindrical substrates, the model predicts a supercritical bifurcation in preferred orientation, from perpendicular to parallel, through an oblique orientation governed by the ratio of active contractility to substrate curvature and modulated by material stiffness. For ellipsoidal geometries, we capture stable parallel, perpendicular, and oblique configurations depending on principal curvatures, whereas spherical substrates do not show preferred alignments. These predictions qualitatively reproduce experimental observations across cell types, explaining divergent behaviors between contractile epithelial cells and stiffer fibroblasts in a rigorous context. Beyond cellular mechanics, this framework applies broadly to thin fiber-reinforced active structures in soft robotics, morphogenesis, and tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>LiquiFab -- Building with liquids in weightlessness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing digital manufacturing methods can be broadly divided into subtractive approaches, where material is removed from a bulk to reveal the desired form, and additive methods, in which material is introduced voxel-by-voxel to create an object.
  We here show a fundamentally different method for the fabrication of three-dimensional objects that is neither subtractive nor additive. Instead of removal or layer-by-layer material deposition, in LiquiFab we shape an entire volume of liquid polymer by subjecting it to a set of geometrical constraints under conditions of weightlessness. The physics of liquid interfaces then drives the polymer to naturally adopt a configuration that minimizes its surface energy. On Earth, we achieve weightlessness through neutral buoyancy, and show that a small, well-defined set of boundary surfaces can be used to drive the liquid into a desired form that is then solidified. By sequentially applying this process, complex architectures can be assembled from successive liquid-formed elements.
  Unlike additive manufacturing, where every point within the object must be individually visited by a print head or light field, LiquiFab forms the entire structure simultaneously. This makes the process highly scalable and opens the door to rapid manufacturing of large objects both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Internal Degrees of Freedom in Structural Relaxation of Ring-Tail Structured Liquids Across Temperature Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how anisotropic molecular rotation and internal molecular flexibility influence liquid dynamics in 1-phenylalkanes. To this end, we combine depolarized dynamic light scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that anisotropic rotations and internal molecular flexibility substantially contribute to structural relaxation in the liquid state. However, their influence diminishes on entering the supercooled-liquid regime, where the relaxation behavior develops towards the previously identified generic relaxation shape, likely due to the increasing cooperativity of rotational dynamics. Because 1-phenylalkanes are simple model systems with similarities to many other molecular liquids, this study suggests that effects of anisotropic rotation and internal flexibility are relevant in various liquids with similar molecular complexity, and provides a proof of concept for how these effects can be identified.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of self-organization in dense persistent active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional athermal binary mixture of Lennard-Jones particles with persistent random active forces. The liquid phase of this system for active forces exceeding a threshold value exhibits self-organization with long-range spatial correlations of particle velocities and active forces. We study by simulations the development of these correlations from a random initial state. Several characteristics of the growth of correlations are measured and compared with those of phase-ordering kinetics of equilibrium systems after a quench from a disordered state. The motion of the particles in the long-time steady state is found to be dominated by two streams that flow in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Thermo-Chemo-Mechanical Framework for Bulk and Frontal Polymerization: Coupled Kinetics and Front Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymerization is a fundamental chemical process enabling large-scale production of material components across modern industries. By transforming a monomer mixture into a cross-linked polymer network, polymerization induces changes in temperature and material properties such as density and stiffness, which can generate residual stress and warping through coupled mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Depending on processing conditions, polymerization may occur either in the bulk, sustained by continuous external energy input, or as a self-sustaining exothermic reaction front, commonly referred to as frontal polymerization. While frontal polymerization offers rapid and energy-efficient curing, its localized reaction zone produces sharp spatial gradients that amplify thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling effects. In this work, we develop a thermodynamically consistent framework that captures both bulk and frontal polymerization, incorporating stress-dependent reaction kinetics and the evolution of the stress-free configuration during curing. Using a narrow reaction-zone approximation in a uniaxial setting, we derive analytical predictions for propagation velocity, residual stress development, and stability. A perturbation analysis yields a stability criterion that generalizes the classical Zeldovich number by accounting for heat loss and mechanical loading, and enables construction of a phase diagram distinguishing stable, unstable, and quenched propagation regimes.</description>

      <title>A ruled narrow elastic strip model with corrected energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new one-dimensional model for elastic strips based on a nondevelopable ruled surface. An auxiliary field regularizes the Sadowsky narrow-strip model to allow nonzero twist with vanishing curvature. The energy exhibits the scalings derived by Freddi and co-workers, and for a certain choice of parameter, convexifies the Sadowsky energy without patching. We present the kinematics and energetics of the model, and employ a variational approach featuring a rotation tensor to derive equilibrium equations. We perform a regular perturbation expansion to study the model behavior close to inflection points. When the energy is convex, curvature and moment are continuous at inflection points, while the auxiliary function suffers a jump, leading to a discontinuity in the ruled embedding for any finite width.</description>

      <title>Stress analysis of dilute particle suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids with efficient evaluation in the weakly non-Newtonian limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytical framework to compute the suspension stress in dilute particle-laden non-Newtonian fluids, separating Newtonian and non-Newtonian contributions. The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-Newtonian stress, for a general constitutive model. For weakly non-Newtonian fluids, a regular perturbation expansion combined with the method of characteristics yields all leading-order stress contributions from the Newtonian velocity field alone, avoiding the need to solve coupled partial differential equations. This generalizes the method of Koch et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 013301 (2016)) beyond polymeric fluids to any weakly non-Newtonian medium driven by velocity and its gradients. We apply the method to two systems: (i) spheres suspended in a fluid of smaller spheroids, where the interaction stress becomes negative for sufficiently anisotropic shapes due to orientation misalignment of the spheroids; and (ii) suspensions in weakly anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. In the latter, assuming a uniform director field fixed by an external field, PINNS vanishes while interaction stresslets remain, either opposing or enhancing background anisotropic stress. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in capturing first-order particle-microstructure interactions across a broad class of non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particles in power-law viscoelastic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many active particles are embedded in environments that exhibit viscoelastic properties. An important class of such media lacks a single characteristic relaxation timescale when subjected to a time-dependent stress. Rather, the stress response spans a broad continuum of timescales, a behavior naturally described by a scale-free, fractal-like power-law relaxation modulus. Using a generalization of the fractional Langevin equation, we investigate an active Brownian particle embedded in a power-law viscoelastic environment with translational and rotational dynamics governed by independent fractional orders. We solve the model analytically, develop a numerical scheme to validate the theoretical predictions, and provide tools that can be used in further studies. A rich variety of diffusion regimes emerges, which modify the intermediate-time behavior of the mean squared displacement. Notably, we find that the competition between translational and rotational contributions favors a superdiffusive persistence over the standard ballistic motion, and over-stretches its characteristic timescale, fundamentally altering the standard relation between persistence and propulsion in active matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous motion of an elliptical Janus particle, driven by Marangoni forces, on a water surface to understand how particle shape and size influence its dynamics. The Janus particle is one-half infused with a substance such as camphor, which lowers the surface tension upon release onto the water surface. The resulting surface tension gradient generates Marangoni forces that propel the particle. For fully camphor-infused (non-Janus) particles, previous studies have shown that motion occurs along the short axis of the ellipse. However, for Janus particles, our experiments reveal a much richer steady-state dynamics, depending on both the particle's eccentricity and size. To understand these dynamics, we develop a numerical model that captures the connection between the spatio-temporal evolution of the camphor concentration field and the Marangoni force driving the particle. Using this model, we simulate the motion of particles with varying eccentricities - from nearly circular to highly elongated shapes. The simulations qualitatively reproduce all the trajectories observed in experiments and provide insights into how particle geometry influences the dynamics of chemically driven anisotropic particles. With the help of the numerical model, we compute a full phase diagram characterising the dynamical states as a function of surfactant properties.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Defect Proliferation in Polar-Apolar Active Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic transitions in inertial fluids typically proceed through a direct energy cascade from large to small scales. In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Together, these findings broaden the understanding of complex transitions in active matter and suggest potential experimental realisations in bacterial suspensions or synthetic microswimmer assemblies.</description>

      <title>Local composition fluctuations act as precursors for crystal nucleation in polydisperse hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the effect of polydispersity on the crystal nucleation of hard spheres. Using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain the nucleation rate as a function of the supersaturation for a range of polydispersities, and demonstrate that the nucleation rate of polydisperse hard spheres deviates from the trend of monodisperse hard spheres, even when mapped to the effective packing fraction. Furthermore, we show that nucleation tends to originate in regions with on average more larger-sized particles, indicating that such regions act as precursors for nucleation in systems of polydisperse hard spheres.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronically Directed Self-Assembly of Active and Passive Particles into Programmable and Reconfigurable Colloidal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled assembly of active-passive colloidal mixtures offers a route to reconfigurable microscale machines, but their self-assembly pathways remain poorly understood. We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Ferrofluids under oscillatory magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrofluids exhibit two canonical interfacial instabilities, a static Rosensweig (normal-field) instability that produces a lattice of peaks and a dynamical Faraday instability that produces parametrically excited standing waves. Here we present a systematic phase diagram of ferrofluid surface states driven by a purely AC vertical magnetic field with zero mean. Scanning a broad range of frequencies and field amplitudes, we resolve two robust branches: a Faraday-wave regime that includes a stable square lattice and a Rosensweig-like peak--valley regime indistinguishable in morphology from Rosensweig peaks. The Faraday-onset boundary is well described by a power law close to $\sqrt{f}$, while the Rosensweig-like peak onset becomes essentially frequency independent at low viscosity. The wave vector of the square lattice grows linearly with frequency over our accessible band. We present a surface-wave theory that captures the full phenomenology, including the emergence of Rosensweig peaks under zero-mean AC driving, the near-$\sqrt{f}$ scaling of the phase boundaries, the linear growth of the selected wave vector with frequency, and the preference for square over hexagonal lattices.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Material Properties of Gelatin with Varying Water to Collagen mass Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gelatin is often used as an analog for studying soft and biological materials in order to understand the mechanics of behavior of biological tissue in events like traumatic brain injuries. The material properties of gelatin change with the ratio of water to gelatin powder used to make a given sample. Characterizing the relationship between this ratio and the material properties of gelatin is crucial to enable its use in mechanics experiments. In this work, compression tests were performed on a texture analyzer on samples which ranged from a 2:1 to 20:1 ratio of water to gelatin powder. In this range, instantaneous stiffnesses were well fit via power law in this ratio and decreased from 277 +/- 30 kPa to 4.34 +/- 0.64 kPa. The dominant (longest) timescales of the samples were well fit via a sigmoid function in this ratio and increased from 29.8 +/- 1.0 s to 621 +/- 92 s. The resulting ratio-property relationships offer a functional way to design gelatin samples for use in mechanics experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation in a noisy environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment is a fundamental problem shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems. Although optimal strategies are often framed in terms of continuous, fine-grained feedback, we show that efficient navigation emerges from a far simpler principle: natural wandering punctuated by intermittent course corrections. Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion. Our results establish intermittent course-correction as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>How fast can a liquid metal drop respond to a time-dependent electrocapillary excitation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gallium alloys are promising materials in biomedical engineering, electronics, and wireless communications, thanks to their good conductivity, non toxicity and their ability to sustain large deformations. They can be transported in capillaries using purely electric means by continuous electrowetting (CEW). Current models of CEW-driven flows do not address the transient response to fast changes in the excitation, crucial in many applications. Here, we present a theory that describes the CEW-driven oscillatory motion of a drop of Eutectic Gallium-Indium alloy inside a capillary. We consider inertia, viscosity and the transient response of the electrical circuit consisting of the drop plus the electrolyte where it is immersed. The theory describes fairly well the experimental drop velocity and explains the existence of an optimal frequency that maximizes the velocity.</description>

      <title>Competing effect of disorder on phase separation in active systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of random pinned disorder on a collection of self propelled particles. To achieve this, we construct a continuum model by formulating the coupled hydrodynamic equations for slow variables, local density and momentum density of particles. The disorder in the system acts as pinning sites, effectively immobilizing the particles that come into contact with them. Our numerical results reveal that weak disorder leads to phase separation in the system at density and activity lower than the typical values for motility induced phase separation. We construct a phase diagram using numerical simulations as well as linearized approximation in the plane of activity and packing fraction of particles at weak disorder densities. On increasing disorder density the system shows the Micro phase separation, while at large disorder densities, the system becomes heterogeneous and eventually undergoes kinetic arrest. The structure factor tail deviates from the Porods law, indicating increased roughness at domain interfaces under strong disorder. Furthermore, we analyze the fractal dimension of the interface as a function of disorder density, highlighting the increasing irregularity of phase separated domains. We also found that disorder significantly suppresses number fluctuations in the system.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal wave-mediated interactions power a classical time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access four distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and structural properties of an absorbing phase transition: a case study from granular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical and structural properties of absorbing phase transitions (APTs) within granular systems. Specifically, we examine a model for vibrofluidized systems of spherical grains, which undergo a transition from a state of purely vertical motion to one characterized by horizontal diffusion as the density increases. Numerical simulations reveal that, depending on the specific system parameters, both continuous and discontinuous transitions can occur, each associated with markedly distinct structural properties at the transition point. We explain this using a theoretical analysis based on kinetic theory applied to an effective 2D model, which elucidates the role of a synchronization effect in determining the nature of the transition. A fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, which quantitatively describes the structural and dynamical properties of the active state such as hyperuniformity is derived from the microscopic dynamics, together with an equilibrium-like assumption concerning the noises on the hydrodynamic fields. This work expands on previous studies by providing a comprehensive examination of the APT characteristics and proposing new theoretical models to interpret the observed behaviors.</description>
