      <title>Power Series Composition in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm that computes the composition of two power series in softly linear time complexity. The previous best algorithms are $\mathop{\mathrm O}(n^{1+o(1)})$ by Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008) and an $\mathop{\mathrm O}(n^{1.43})$ algebraic algorithm by Neiger, Salvy, Schost and Villard (JACM 2023).
  Our algorithm builds upon the recent Graeffe iteration approach to manipulate rational power series introduced by Bostan and Mori (SOSA 2021).</description>

      <title>A proof of the Brill-Noether method from scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1874 Brill and Noether designed a seminal geometric method for computing bases of Riemann-Roch spaces. From then, their method has led to several algorithms, some of them being implemented in computer algebra systems. The usual proofs often rely on abstract concepts of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. In this paper we present a short self-contained and elementary proof that mostly needs Newton polygons, Hensel lifting, bivariate resultants, and Chinese remaindering.</description>

      <title>The solving degrees for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the solving degrees for affine semi-regular sequences and their homogenized sequences. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence. This paper is a sequel of the authors' previous work and gives additional results on the solving degrees and important behaviors of Gr\"obner basis computation.
  We also define the generalized degree of regularity for a sequence of homogeneous polynomials. For the ideal generated by the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence, we relate its generalized degree of regularity with its maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree (i.e., the solving degree for the homogenized sequence). The definition of a generalized (cryptographic) semi-regular sequence is also given, and it derives a new cryptographic assumption to estimate the security of cryptosystems. From our experimental observation, we raise a conjecture and some questions related to this generalized semi-regularity. These definitions and our results provide a theoretical formulation of (somehow heuristic) discussions done so far in the cryptographic community.</description>

      <title>Algebraic power series and their automatic complexity II: modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. We improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description>
