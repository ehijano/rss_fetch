      <title>Probing cellular activity via charge-sensitive quantum nanoprobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of Acoustic Streaming in Mid-Air Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-air acoustic streaming, where ultrasound induces steady fluid motion, could significantly affect the perception of haptic sensations, stability of levitation systems, and enable controlled transfer of odours (smells) through air by directing volatile compounds to specific locations. Despite its importance, the streaming behavior in airborne phased-array transducers remains poorly understood. Here, we use particle image velocimetry and numerical simulations to investigate streaming dynamics in single- and multi-focus acoustic fields. Experimental measurements reveal streaming velocities exceeding $0.4~\text{m/s}$ in single-focus configurations and up to $0.3~\text{m/s}$ in multi-focus setups, with distinct grating lobe-induced lateral jets. While multi-physics finite-element models effectively capture central streaming, they exhibit subtle differences and perform poorly in capturing flow in the side lobes. These findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between acoustic field design and streaming dynamics, offering guidance for optimizing ultrasonic technologies in haptics and levitation applications.</description>

      <title>Spiking Rate and Latency Encoding with Resonant Tunnelling Diode Neuron Circuits and Design Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the functionality and efficiency of biological neural systems, holds promise for advancing artificial intelligence and computational paradigms. Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), thanks to their ability to generate neuronal dynamical responses, such as excitable spiking and refractoriness, have recently emerged as candidates for use as opto-electronic spiking neurons in novel neuromorphic computing hardware. This work explores the ability of RTD spiking neurons to deliver information encoding mechanisms analogous to those observed in biological neurons, specifically spike firing rate and spike latency encoding. We also report detailed experimental and numerical studies on the impact that the RTD mesa radius and circuit inductance and capacitance have on its spiking properties, providing useful information for future design of RTD-based neural networks optimised for ultrafast (&gt;GHz rate) processing capabilities. Finally, we showcase the application of spike rate encoding in RTD neurons for the ultrafast reconstruction of a eight-level amplitude signal, effectively filtering out the noise.</description>

      <title>Penetration depth and effective sample size characterization of UV/Vis radiation into pharmaceutical tablets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry is moving from off-line quality testing to real-time release testing (RTRT) to improve drug quality while reducing costs. The implementation of RTRT requires advanced in-line process analytics, where UV/Vis spectroscopy has proven its suitability. However, quantification of the sample size requires detailed knowledge of the penetration depth. In this study, bilayer tablets were produced using a hydraulic tablet press. The lower layer contained titanium dioxide and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), while the upper layer consisted of MCC, lactose or a combination with theophylline. The thickness of the upper layer was stepwise increased. Spectra from 224 to 820 nm were recorded with an orthogonally aligned UV/Vis probe. Thereby, the experimental penetration depth reached up to 0.4 mm, while the Kubelka-Munk model yielded a theoretical maximum penetration depth of 1.38 mm. Based on these values, the effective sample sizes were determined. Considering a parabolic penetration profile, the maximum volume was 2.01 mm$^3$. The results indicated a wavelength and particle size dependency. Micro-CT analysis confirmed the even distribution of the API in the tablets proving the sufficiency of the UV/Vis sample size. Consequently, UV/Vis spectroscopy is a reliable alternative for RTRT in tableting.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic thermal management in X-ray tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In X-ray tubes, more than 99% of the kilowatts of power supplied to generate X-rays via bremsstrahlung are lost in the form of heat generation in the anode. Therefore, thermal management is a critical barrier to the development of more powerful X-ray tubes with higher brightness and spatial coherence, which are needed to translate imaging modalities such as phase-contrast imaging to the clinic. In rotating anode X-ray tubes, the most common design, thermal radiation is a bottleneck that prevents efficient cooling of the anode$\unicode{x2014}$the hottest part of the device by far. We predict that nanophotonically patterning the anode of an X-ray tube enhances heat dissipation via thermal radiation, enabling it to operate at higher powers without increasing in temperature. The focal spot size, which is related to the spatial coherence of generated X-rays, can also be made smaller at a constant temperature. A major advantage of our "nanophotonic thermal management" approach is that in principle, it allows for complete control over the spectrum and direction of thermal radiation, which can lead to optimal thermal routing and improved performance.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterization of colloidal silver nanofluids by photothermal techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, Ag0 nanoparticles (NPs)were synthesized and detected by flow-injection analysis coupled to collinear dual-beam thermal lens spectrometric (TLS) detection. The estimated limit of detection was 0.8 microgram/L. The use of 2 the IonPac Cryptand G1 column enabled Ag0 NPs detection in the presence of interfering ions normally present in water. Ag0 nanofluids (NFs) were further characterized by time-resolved TLS and beam deflection spectrometry to determine the NFs thermal diffusivity and conductivity. The applied methods were found to be fast, simple,reliable, and highly sensitive.</description>

      <title>Amplifying solid-state high harmonic generations with momentum k-gaps in band structure engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials. Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical bistability in microring resonators for enhanced phase sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic microring resonators are used in a variety of chip-integrated sensing applications where they allow one to measure transmission intensity changes upon external signals with a sensitivity that scales linearly with the Q factor. In this work, we suggest exploiting the nonlinear self-phase-modulation effect to increase the overall sensitivity by an additional gain factor appearing when the operational point of the nonlinear resonator is chosen just at the crossover from the monostable to the bistable regime. We present the theoretical idea together with a first proof of concept experiment displaying a gain factor of 22 on a chip-integrated silicon-nitride resonator.</description>
