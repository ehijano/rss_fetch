      <title>On Modeling and Solving the Boltzmann Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation has been a driving force behind significant mathematical research over the years. Its challenging theoretical complexity, combined with a wide variety of current scientific and technological problems that require numerical simulations based on this model, justifies such interest. This work provides a brief overview of studies and advances related to the solution of the linear Boltzmann equation in one- and two-dimensional spatial dimensions. In particular, relevant aspects of the discrete ordinates approximation of the model are highlighted for neutron and photon transport applications, including nuclear safeguards, nuclear reactor shielding problems, and optical tomography. In addition, a short discussion on rarefied gas dynamics problems, which are relevant, for instance, in the studies of micro-electro-mechanical systems, and their connection with the linearized Boltzmann equation, is presented. A primary goal of the work is to establish as much as possible the connections between the different phenomena described by the model and the versatility of the analytical methodology, the ADO method, in providing concise and accurate solutions, which are fundamental for numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Properties of the temporal transfer matrix in integrable Floquet circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One possible approach to studying non-equilibrium dynamics is the so-called influence matrix (IM) formalism. The influence matrix can be viewed as a quantum state that encodes complete information about the non-equilibrium dynamics of a boundary degree of freedom. It has been shown that the IM is the unique stationary point of the temporal transfer matrix. This transfer matrix, however, is non-diagonalizable and exhibits a non-trivial Jordan block structure. In this article, we demonstrate that, in the case of an integrable XXZ spin chain, the temporal transfer matrix itself is integrable and can be embedded into a family of commuting operators. We further provide the exact expression for the IM as a particular limit of a Bethe wavefunction, with the corresponding Bethe roots given explicitly. We also focus on the special case of the free-fermionic XX chain. In this setting, we uncover additional local integrals of motion, which enable us to analyze the dimensions and structure of the Jordan blocks, as well as the locality properties of the IM. Moreover, we construct a basis of quasi-local creation operators that generate the IM from the vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Modular transformations of tau functions and conformal blocks on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection problem for isomonodromic tau functions on the one-punctured torus concerns the ratio between the tau function and its modular transform, associated to dual pants decompositions of the torus. In this paper, we study the modular transformations of the tau function and consequently derive the connection constant. Moreover, through the relation with two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we also obtain an exact closed formula for the $c=1$ Virasoro modular kernel, whose expression was previously unknown, and relate it to the $c\rightarrow\infty$ (semiclassical) modular kernel and $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ complex Chern-Simons amplitudes. Finally, we prove that the connection constant and the two, $c=1$ and $c\to \infty$, modular kernels are generating functions of canonical transformations on the character variety of the one-punctured torus. Our results are also relevant for the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ gauge theory.</description>

      <title>A proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality using a geometric-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach. The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism. Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS space.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Distribution of Large Weighted Random Sparse Uniform $q$-Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrix $A^{(N,p,q)}$ of weighted random uniform $q$-hypergraphs $\Gamma= \Gamma_{N,p,q}$. We assume that the graphs have $N$ vertices and the average number of hyperedges attached to one vertex is $(q-1)!\cdot p$. To each edge of the graph $e_{ij}$ we assign a weight given by a random variable $a_{ij}$ with all moments finite. We consider the moments of normalized eigenvalue counting function $\sigma_{N,p,q}$ of $A^{(N,p,q)}$. Assuming all moments of $a$ finite, we obtain recurrent relations that determine the moments of the limiting measure $\sigma_{p,q} = \lim_{N\to\infty} \sigma_{N,p,q}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Algebra Grounded on Nonadditive Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $N$-body system is simple if all associated physically relevant space-time correlations are short-ranged, meaning that their momenta of all orders are finite. Such systems typically have a total number $W$ of admissible microscopic configurations which grows with $N$ as $W(N) \sim \mu^N\;(\mu &gt;1, \, N\to\infty)$. Their thermostatistical properties are known to be satisfactorily handled within Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. In contrast, a system is complex if one or more associated correlations are long-ranged. The simplest examples of such systems are those for which $W(N) \sim N^\rho\;\;(\rho&gt;0)$. A generalized statistical mechanics grounded on the nonadditive entropic functional $S_q(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \;\;(q\in \mathbb{R}, \;S_1=S_{BG})$ with $\ln_q z =\frac{z^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$ ($\ln_1 z=\ln z$) satisfactorily handles such systems. Indeed, for equiprobabilities, $S_{q=1-1/\rho}(\{1/W(N)\})=k\ln_{1-1/\rho} W(N) \propto N$. Furthermore, for complex systems, the size of the corresponding phase spaces can be related to the property $\ln_q (x\otimes_q y) =\ln_q x + \ln_q y$, $x,y\geq1$, $q\leq 1$, where $x\otimes_q y=[x^{1-q}+y^{1-q}-1]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}_{+}\;\;(x\otimes_1 y=xy)$, and the $q$-product $\otimes_q$ grounds the definition of a $q$-generalized algebra. Another class of complex systems corresponds to $W(N) \sim \nu^{N^\gamma}\;\;(\nu &gt;1, \,\gamma &gt; 0)$, which appears to be the case of black holes and other cosmological phenomena. This class can be handled with $S_\delta(\{p_{i}\}) = k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta \;\;(\delta&gt;0)$. Finally, we can define $S_{q,\delta}(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta$ $(q\in\mathbb{R},\delta&gt;0)$, which unifies all the above ones. In this paper, we generalize the $q$-algebra to a new, promising one, namely the $(q,\delta)$-algebra.</description>

      <title>An infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorem and the construction of almost periodic breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorems based on nonresonant frequencies of Bourgain's Diophantine type or even weaker conditions. To be more precise, under a nondegenerate condition for an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, we prove the persistence of a full-dimensional KAM torus with the universally prescribed frequency that is independent of any spectral asymptotics. As an application, we prove that for a class of perturbed networks with weakly coupled oscillators described by \[\frac{{{{\rm d}^2}{x_n}}}{{{\rm d}{t^2}}} + V'\left( {{x_n}} \right) = \varepsilon_n {W'\left( {{x_{n + 1}} - {x_n}} \right) - \varepsilon_{n-1}W'\left( {{x_n} - {x_{n - 1}}} \right)} ,\;\;n \in \mathbb{Z},\] or even for more general perturbed networks, almost periodic breathers with frequency-preserving do exist, provided that the local potential $ V $ and the coupling potential $ W $ satisfy certain assumptions. In particular, this yields the first frequency-preserving version of the Aubry-MacKay conjecture [8,21].</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of simple eigenvalues of particle-in-well systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle in a well in dimension one is a classical problem in quantum mechanics. We study higher-dimensional analogues of the problem, where the well is a smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that simple eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator depend smoothly on the square root $h$ of the inverse depth of the well and provide an explicit first-order expansion of the eigenvalues at $h = 0$.
  Our proof consists of two steps. In the first step, we construct $\mathcal{O}(h^\infty)$ quasimodes (approximate eigenfunctions) on a resolution of $[0, 1)_h\times\mathbb{R}^d$ which allows us to capture fine structure near the boundary of the well. The second step corrects these quasimodes to true eigenfunctions via a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral properties of electromagnetic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a reference homogeneous and isotropic electromagnetic waveguide with a simply connected cross-section embedded in a perfect conductor. In this setting, when the waveguide is straight, the spectrum of the associated self-adjoint Maxwell operator with a constant twist (which may be zero) lies on the real line and is symmetric with respect to zero and exhibits a spectral gap around the origin. Moreover, the spectrum is purely essential, and contains 0 which is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. In this work, we present new results on the effects of geometric deformations, specifically bending and twisting, on the spectrum of the Maxwell operator. More precisely, we provide, on the one hand, sufficient conditions on the asymptotic behavior of curvature and twist that ensure the preservation of the essential spectrum of the reference waveguide. Our approach relies on a Birman-Schwinger-type principle, which may be of independent interest and applicable in other contexts. On the other hand, we give sufficient conditions (involving in particular the geometrical shape of the cross-section of the waveguide) so that the geometrical deformation creates discrete spectrum (namely isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity) within the gap of the essential spectrum. In addition, we give some results on the localization of these discrete eigenvalues. The sufficient condition involving the cross-section is then studied both analytically and numerically. Finally, we examine its stability under shape deformations of the cross-section, focusing in particular on the case of a waveguide with a rectangular cross-section.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems.
  In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions is a typical example of stochastic log-gas. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Surface sums in two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills: Cancellations and explicit computation for general loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications, because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model admitting many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool, in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process") which at each step carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the three-wave and four-wave kinetic equations into the GENERIC framework and formally derive a small-angle limit for the four-wave equation. This limit is akin to the well-known grazing limit from the kinetic Boltzmann equation to the kinetic Landau equation. We also show the GENERIC structure of the limiting system.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Lieb--Wehrl Entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of $SU(N,1)$. These inequalities are rooted in Wehrl's definition of semiclassical entropy and his conjecture about its minimum value. Lieb resolved this conjecture in 1978, posing a similar question for Bloch coherent states of $SU(2)$. The $SU(2)$ conjecture was settled by Lieb and Solovej in 2014, and the conjecture was extended for a wide class of Lie groups. The generalized Lieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups, including $SU(N),\, N\geq 2$, $SU(1,1)$, and its $AX+B$ subgroup. Under the Li--Su assumption on isoperimetric regions in the complex hyperbolic ball, our sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms extend this resolution to $SU(N,1),\, N\geq 2$. Additionally, we explore the Faber--Krahn inequality, which applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. This inequality was previously proven by Nicola and Tilli and later extended by Ramos and Tilli to the wavelet transform. In this paper, we further extend this result within the framework of the Bergman space $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas. To be precise, starting from many-body quantum mechanics, where the problem is linear and regular but involving non commutative operators, we justify the emergence of the $\Phi^4_3$ measure as a semiclassical limit which captures the formation of Bose--Einstein condensation just above the critical temperature. We employ and develop several tools from both stochastic quantization and many-body quantum mechanics. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, our first key step involves approximating the $\Phi^4_3$ measure through a Hartree measure with nonlocal interaction, achieved by developing new techniques in paracontrolled calculus. The connection between the quantum problem and the Hartree measure emerges through a variational interplay between classical and quantum models.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the connection between perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation in the setting of the two-periodic Aztec diamond. In particular, we show that the positions of both the t-embedding and the corresponding origami map can be expressed as sums of density functions arising from solutions to the octahedron equation with appropriate flat initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Structures in Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the implications of applying the formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics, particularly focusing on many-particle systems. We extend the concept of a symplectic indicator of entanglement, originally introduced by Sawicki et al. \cite{sawicki2011}, to these complex systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that the restriction of the symplectic structure to manifolds comprising all states characterized by isospectral reduced one-particle density matrices, \( M_{\mu(\psi)}^0 \), exhibits degeneracy for non-separable states. We prove that the degree of degeneracy at any given state \( \ket{\varphi} \in M_{\mu(\psi)}^0 \) corresponds to the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic form \( \omega \) when restricted to the manifold of states that are locally unitary equivalent with \( \ket{\varphi} \). Additionally, we provide a physical interpretation of this symplectic indicator of entanglement, articulating it as an inherent ambiguity within the associated classical dynamical framework. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of symplectic geometry in elucidating entanglement properties in quantum mechanics and suggest avenues for further exploration into the geometric structures underlying quantum state spaces.</description>

      <title>On palindromic numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From our work on partition functions in log gravity, we show that the palindromic numerators in two variables of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series take the form of sums of products of Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated with a pair of partition $\lambda$ and $\mu=(1^n)$. The log partition function also being a KP $\tau$-function, our work gives a new description of Hall-Littlewood and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials as palindromic numerators of quotient expansions in the moduli space of formal power series solutions of the KP hierarchy. Using the structure and properties of the log partition function, we also show that the palindromic polynomials are eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) extend the equations of incompressible Hall MHD (HMHD) by retaining finite-electron inertia. These XMHD equations couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ in a process that is known to support dissipationless solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the magnetic plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four XMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hopf insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent a unique class of topological insulators that exist exclusively in two-band systems and are inherently unstable upon the inclusion of additional bands. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive complex-energy gap structures, known as point gaps, and associated topological phases with no analogs in Hermitian systems. However, non-Hermitian counterparts of Hopf insulators have remained largely elusive. Here, we generally classify topological phases of two-band non-Hermitian systems based on the homotopy theory and uncover Hopf-type point-gap topology present only for two bands. Specifically, we reveal such Hopf-type point-gap topology for three-dimensional systems with chiral symmetry (class AIII) and four-dimensional systems with no symmetry (class A). Explicitly constructing prototypical models from the Hermitian Hopf insulator, we further demonstrate that these non-Hermitian topological phases lead to anomalous point-gapless boundary states spectrally detachable from the bulk bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variation of the classic ballistic deposition model in which vertically falling blocks can only stick to the top or the upper right corner of growing columns. We establish that fluctuations of the height function at points near the $t$-axis are given by the GUE ensemble and its corresponding Tracy-Widom limiting distribution. The proof is based on a graphical construction of the process in terms of a directed Last Passage Percolation model. Using this graphical construction, we define the notion of geodesics for the height function and show that the wandering exponent governing the transversal fluctuations of these geodesics is $2/3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.</description>

Abstract: We study a fuzzy variant of the inhomogeneous Landau equation and establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions for moderately soft potentials. The spatial delocalization introduced in the collision operator not only enhances regularity and prevents singularity formation, but also reveals additional structural properties of the model. In particular, we show that several forms of the Fisher information decay monotonically or remain uniformly bounded in time.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting, we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [44], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [50].</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classical-Quantum Hybrid System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Extending fusion rules with finite subgroups: For a general understanding of quotient or gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>
