      <title>A Liang-Kleeman Causality Analysis based on Linear Inverse Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality analysis is a powerful tool for determining cause-and-effect relationships between variables in a system by quantifying the influence of one variable on another. Despite significant advancements in the field, many existing studies are constrained by their focus on unidirectional causality or Gaussian external forcing, limiting their applicability to complex real-world problems. This study proposes a novel data-driven approach to causality analysis for complex stochastic differential systems, integrating the concepts of Liang-Kleeman information flow and linear inverse modeling. Our method models environmental noise as either memoryless Gaussian white noise or memory-retaining Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise, and allows for self and mutual causality, providing a more realistic representation and interpretation of the underlying system. Moreover, this LIM-based approach can identify the individual contribution of dynamics and correlation to causality. We apply this approach to re-examine the causal relationships between the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), two major climate phenomena that significantly influence global climate patterns. In general, regardless of the type of noise used, the causality between ENSO and IOD is mutual but asymmetric, with the causality map reflecting an ENSO-like pattern consistent with previous studies. Notably, in the case of colored noise, the noise memory map reveals a hotspot in the Ni\~no 3 region, which is further related to the information flow. This suggests that our approach offers a more comprehensive framework and provides deeper insights into the causal inference of global climate systems.</description>

      <title>Bi-level regularization via iterative mesh refinement for aeroacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we illustrate the connection between adaptive mesh refinement for finite element discretized PDEs and the recently developed \emph{bi-level regularization algorithm}. By adaptive mesh refinement according to data noise, regularization effect and convergence are immediate consequences. We moreover demonstrate its numerical advantages to the classical Landweber algorithm in term of time and reconstruction quality for the example of the Helmholtz equation in an aeroacoustic setting.</description>

      <title>Coordinate complexification for the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a perturbed half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new complexification scheme based on the classical double layer potential for the solution of the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in compactly perturbed half-spaces in two and three dimensions. The kernel for the double layer potential is the normal derivative of the free-space Green's function, which has a well-known analytic continuation into the complex plane as a function of both target and source locations. Here, we prove that - when the incident data are analytic and satisfy a precise asymptotic estimate - the solution to the boundary integral equation itself admits an analytic continuation into specific regions of the complex plane, and satisfies a related asymptotic estimate (this class of data includes both plane waves and the field induced by point sources). We then show that, with a carefully chosen contour deformation, the oscillatory integrals are converted to exponentially decaying integrals, effectively reducing the infinite domain to a domain of finite size. Our scheme is different from existing methods that use complex coordinate transformations, such as perfectly matched layers, or absorbing regions, such as the gradual complexification of the governing wavenumber. More precisely, in our method, we are still solving a boundary integral equation, albeit on a truncated, complexified version of the original boundary. In other words, no volumetric/domain modifications are introduced. The scheme can be extended to other boundary conditions, to open wave guides and to layered media. We illustrate the performance of the scheme with two and three dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>$M$-QR decomposition and hyperpower iterative methods for computing outer inverses of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer inverse of tensors plays increasingly significant roles in computational mathematics, numerical analysis, and other generalized inverses of tensors. In this paper, we compute outer inverses with prescribed ranges and kernels of a given tensor through tensor QR decomposition and hyperpower iterative method under the M-product structure, which is a family of tensor-tensor products, generalization of the t-product and c-product, allows us to suit the physical interpretations across those different modes. We discuss a theoretical analysis of the nineteen-order convergence of the proposed tensor-based iterative method. Further, we design effective tensor-based algorithms for computing outer inverses using M-QR decomposition and hyperpower iterative method. The theoretical results are validated with numerical examples demonstrating the appropriateness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Reynolds-semi-robust and pressure robust Hybrid High-Order method for the time dependent incompressible Navier--Stokes equations on general meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop and analyze a Reynolds-semi-robust and pressure-robust Hybrid High-Order (HHO) discretization of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Reynolds-semi-robustness refers to the fact that, under suitable regularity assumptions, the right-hand side of the velocity error estimate does not depend on the inverse of the viscosity. This property is obtained here through a penalty term which involves a subtle projection of the convective term on a subgrid space constructed element by element. The estimated convergence order for the $L^\infty(L^2)$- and $L^2(\text{energy})$-norm of the velocity is $h^{k+\frac12}$, which matches the best results for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin methods and corresponds to the one expected for HHO methods in convection-dominated regimes. Two-dimensional numerical results on a variety of polygonal meshes complete the exposition.</description>

      <title>A compatible finite element discretisation for moist shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moist shallow water equations offer a promising route for advancing understanding of the coupling of physical parametrisations and dynamics in numerical atmospheric models, an issue known as 'physics-dynamics coupling'. Without moist physics, the traditional shallow water equations are a simplified form of the atmospheric equations of motion and so are computationally cheap, but retain many relevant dynamical features of the atmosphere. Introducing physics into the shallow water model in the form of moisture provides a tool to experiment with numerical techniques for physics-dynamics coupling in a simple dynamical model. In this paper, we compare some of the different moist shallow water models by writing them in a general formulation. The general formulation encompasses three existing forms of the moist shallow water equations and also a fourth, previously unexplored formulation. The equations are coupled to a three-state moist physics scheme that interacts with the resolved flow through source terms and produces two-way physics-dynamics feedback. We present a new compatible finite element discretisation of the equations and apply it to the different formulations of the moist shallow water equations in three test cases. The results show that the models capture generation of cloud and rain and physics-dynamics interactions, and demonstrate some differences between moist shallow water formulations and the implications of these different modelling choices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Weak Galerkin finite element approximation of the Singularly Perturbed Biharmonic elliptic problem on a unit square domain with clamped boundary conditions. Shishkin mesh is used for domain discretization as the solution exhibits boundary layers near the domain boundary. Error estimates in the equivalent $H^{2}-$ norm have been established and the uniform convergence of the proposed method has been proved. Numerical examples are presented corroborating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation of stationary Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations with application to periodic numerical homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and rigorously analyze a finite element method for the approximation of stationary Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov (FPK) equations subject to periodic boundary conditions in two settings: one with weakly differentiable coefficients, and one with merely essentially bounded measurable coefficients under a Cordes-type condition. These problems arise as governing equations for the invariant measure in the homogenization of nondivergence-form equations with large drifts. In particular, the Cordes setting guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a square-integrable invariant measure. We then suggest and rigorously analyze an approximation scheme for the effective diffusion matrix in both settings, based on the finite element scheme for stationary FPK problems developed in the first part. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the methods through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for eigenvalue computation using a distributed cooperative neural network framework. Unlike traditional techniques that struggle with scalability in large systems, our decentralized algorithm enables multiple autonomous agents to collaboratively estimate the smallest eigenvalue of large matrices. Each agent uses a localized neural network model, refining its estimates through inter-agent communication. Our approach guarantees convergence to the true eigenvalue, even with communication failures or network disruptions. Theoretical analysis confirms the robustness and accuracy of the method, while empirical results demonstrate its better performance compared to some traditional centralized algorithms</description>

      <title>The Weak Form Is Stronger Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak form is a ubiquitous, well-studied, and widely-utilized mathematical tool in modern computational and applied mathematics. In this work we provide a survey of both the history and recent developments for several fields in which the weak form can play a critical role. In particular, we highlight several recent advances in weak form versions of equation learning, parameter estimation, and coarse graining, which offer surprising noise robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

      <title>A tutorial on automatic differentiation with complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation is everywhere, but there exists only minimal documentation of how it works in complex arithmetic beyond stating "derivatives in $\mathbb{C}^d$" $\cong$ "derivatives in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$" and, at best, shallow references to Wirtinger calculus. Unfortunately, the equivalence $\mathbb{C}^d \cong \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ becomes insufficient as soon as we need to derive custom gradient rules, e.g., to avoid differentiating "through" expensive linear algebra functions or differential equation simulators. To combat such a lack of documentation, this article surveys forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation with complex numbers, covering topics such as Wirtinger derivatives, a modified chain rule, and different gradient conventions while explicitly avoiding holomorphicity and the Cauchy--Riemann equations (which would be far too restrictive). To be precise, we will derive, explain, and implement a complex version of Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products almost entirely with linear algebra without relying on complex analysis or differential geometry. This tutorial is a call to action, for users and developers alike, to take complex values seriously when implementing custom gradient propagation rules -- the manuscript explains how.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Error-Bounded Hierarchical Matrices in Neural Network Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework that integrates hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) compression techniques into the structure and training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By leveraging the low-rank properties of matrix sub-blocks, the proposed dynamic, error-bounded H-matrix compression method significantly reduces computational complexity and storage requirements without compromising accuracy. This approach is rigorously compared to traditional compression techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), pruning, and quantization, demonstrating superior performance, particularly in maintaining the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) properties critical for the stability and convergence of neural networks. The findings reveal that H-matrix compression not only enhances training efficiency but also ensures the scalability and robustness of PINNs for complex, large-scale applications in physics-based modeling. This work offers a substantial contribution to the optimization of deep learning models, paving the way for more efficient and practical implementations of PINNs in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <title>Local Sequential MCMC for Data Assimilation with Applications in Geoscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data assimilation (DA) scheme based on a sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) DA technique [Ruzayqat et al. 2024] which is provably convergent and has been recently used for filtering, particularly for high-dimensional non-linear, and potentially, non-Gaussian state-space models. Unlike particle filters, which can be considered exact methods and can be used for filtering non-linear, non-Gaussian models, SMCMC does not assign weights to the samples/particles, and therefore, the method does not suffer from the issue of weight-degeneracy when a relatively small number of samples is used. We design a localization approach within the SMCMC framework that focuses on regions where observations are located and restricts the transition densities included in the filtering distribution of the state to these regions. This results in immensely reducing the effective degrees of freedom and thus improving the efficiency. We test the new technique on high-dimensional ($d \sim 10^4 - 10^5$) linear Gaussian model and non-linear shallow water models with Gaussian noise with real and synthetic observations. For two of the numerical examples, the observations mimic the data generated by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission led by NASA, which is a swath of ocean height observations that changes location at every assimilation time step. We also use a set of ocean drifters' real observations in which the drifters are moving according the ocean kinematics and assumed to have uncertain locations at the time of assimilation. We show that when higher accuracy is required, the proposed algorithm is superior in terms of efficiency and accuracy over competing ensemble methods and the original SMCMC filter.</description>

      <title>Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo method for approximations of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients</title>

Abstract: In the field of computational finance, one is commonly interested in the expected value of a financial derivative whose payoff depends on the solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). For multi-dimensional SDEs with non-commutative diffusion coefficients in the globally Lipschitz setting, a kind of one-half order truncated Milstein-type scheme without L\'evy areas was recently introduced by Giles and Szpruch (2014), which combined with the antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) gives the optimal overall computational cost $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for the required target accuracy $\epsilon$. Nevertheless, many nonlinear SDEs in applications have non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients and the corresponding theoretical guarantees for antithetic MLMC are absent in the literature. In the present work, we aim to fill the gap and analyze antithetic MLMC in a non-globally Lipschitz setting. First, we propose a family of modified Milstein-type schemes without L\'evy areas to approximate SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. The expected one-half order of strong convergence is recovered in a non-globally Lipschitz setting, where even the diffusion coefficients are allowed to grow superlinearly. This then helps us to analyze the relevant variance of the multilevel estimator and the optimal computational cost is finally achieved for the antithetic MLMC. Since getting rid of the L\'evy areas destroys the martingale properties of the scheme, the analysis of both the convergence rate and the desired variance becomes highly non-trivial in the non-globally Lipschitz setting. By introducing an auxiliary approximation process, we develop non-standard arguments to overcome the essential difficulties. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) treat the numerical simulation of dynamical systems as problems of Bayesian state estimation. Aside from producing posterior distributions over ODE solutions and thereby quantifying the numerical approximation error of the method itself, one less-often noted advantage of this formalism is the algorithmic flexibility gained by formulating numerical simulation in the framework of Bayesian filtering and smoothing. In this paper, we leverage this flexibility and build on the time-parallel formulation of iterated extended Kalman smoothers to formulate a parallel-in-time probabilistic numerical ODE solver. Instead of simulating the dynamical system sequentially in time, as done by current probabilistic solvers, the proposed method processes all time steps in parallel and thereby reduces the span cost from linear to logarithmic in the number of time steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of ODEs and compare it to a range of both classic and probabilistic numerical ODE solvers.</description>

      <title>Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrators for advection-diffusion and Fokker-Planck models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach termed the Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) method by investigating two predominant research directions in low-rank solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs): dynamical low-rank (DLR), and step and truncation (SAT) tensor methods. The RAIL method, along with the development of the SAT approach, is designed to enhance the efficiency of traditional full-rank implicit solvers from method-of-lines discretizations of time-dependent PDEs, while maintaining accuracy and stability. We consider spectral methods for spatial discretization, and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for time discretization. The efficiency gain is achieved by investigating low-rank structures within solutions at each RK stage using a singular value decomposition (SVD). In particular, we develop a reduced augmentation procedure to predict the basis functions to construct projection subspaces. This procedure balances algorithm accuracy and efficiency by incorporating as many bases as possible from previous RK stages and predictions, and by optimizing the basis representation through SVD truncation. As such, one can form implicit schemes for updating basis functions in a dimension-by-dimension manner, similar in spirit to the K-L step in the DLR framework. We also apply a globally mass conservative post-processing step at the end of each RK stage. We validate the RAIL method through numerical simulations of advection-diffusion problems and a Fokker-Planck model, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle time-dependent PDEs while maintaining global mass conservation. Our approach generalizes and bridges the DLR and SAT approaches, offering a comprehensive framework for efficiently and accurately solving time-dependent PDEs with implicit treatment.</description>

      <title>A robust and adaptive GenEO-type domain decomposition preconditioner for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems in three-dimensional general topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we design, analyse and test domain decomposition methods for linear systems of equations arising from conforming finite element discretisations of positive Maxwell-type equations, namely for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems. It is well known that convergence of domain decomposition methods rely heavily on the efficiency of the coarse space used in the second level. We design adaptive coarse spaces that complement a near-kernel space made from the gradient of scalar functions. The new class of preconditioner is inspired by the idea of subspace decomposition, but based on spectral coarse spaces, and is specially designed for curl-conforming discretisations of Maxwell's equations in heterogeneous media on general domains which may have holes. We also address the practical robustness of various solvers in the case of non-trivial topologies and/or high aspect ratio of the domain.</description>

      <title>An iterative method for the solution of Laplace-like equations in high and very high space dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the equation $-\Delta u+\mu u=f$ on high-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^m$, where the right-hand side $f(x)=F(Tx)$ is composed of a separable function $F$ with an integrable Fourier transform on a space of a dimension $n&gt;m$ and a linear mapping given by a matrix $T$ of full rank and $\mu\geq 0$ is a constant. For example, the right-hand side can explicitly depend on differences $x_i-x_j$ of components of $x$. We show that the solution of this equation can be expanded into sums of functions of the same structure and develop in this framework an equally simple and fast iterative method for its computation. The method is based on the observation that in almost all cases and for large problem classes the expression $\|T^ty\|^2$ deviates on the unit sphere $\|y\|=1$ the less from its mean value the higher the dimension $m$ is, a concentration of measure effect. The higher the dimension $m$, the faster the iteration converges.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Different Elastic Strain Definitions for Largely Deformed SEI of Chemo-Mechanically Coupled Silicon Battery Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous silicon is a highly promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Large volume changes of the silicon particle have a critical effect on the surrounding solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) due to repeated fracture and healing during cycling. Based on a thermodynamically consistent chemo-elasto-plastic continuum model we investigate the stress development inside the particle and the SEI. Using the example of a particle with SEI, we apply a higher order finite element method together with a variable-step, variable-order time integration scheme on a nonlinear system of partial differential equations. Starting from a single silicon particle setting, the surrounding SEI is added in a first step with the typically used elastic Green--St-Venant (GSV) strain definition for a purely elastic deformation. For this type of deformation, the definition of the elastic strain is crucial to get reasonable simulation results. In case of the elastic GSV strain, the simulation aborts. We overcome the simulation failure by using the definition of the logarithmic Hencky strain. However, the particle remains unaffected by the elastic strain definitions in the particle domain. Compared to GSV, plastic deformation with the Hencky strain is straightforward to take into account. For the plastic SEI deformation, a rate-independent and a rate-dependent plastic deformation are newly introduced and numerically compared for three half cycles for the example of a radial symmetric particle.</description>

      <title>Boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous analysis of boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on Lipschitz polyhedra. The magnetic field integral equation is widely used in practical applications to model electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting body. The governing operator is shown to be coercive by means of the electric field integral operator with a purely imaginary wave number. Consequently, the continuous variational problem is uniquely solvable, given that the wave number does not belong to the spectrum of the interior Maxwell's problem. A Petrov-Galerkin discretization scheme is then introduced, employing Raviart-Thomas boundary elements for the solution space and Buffa-Christiansen boundary elements for the test space. Under a mild assumption depending only on the geometrical domain, the corresponding discrete inf-sup condition is proven, implying the unique solvability of the discrete problem. An asymptotically quasi-optimal error estimate for numerical solutions is established, and the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is examined. In addition, the resulting matrix system is shown to be well-conditioned regardless of the mesh refinement. Some numerical results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Neural Integral Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15190v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear operators with long distance spatiotemporal dependencies are fundamental in modeling complex systems across sciences, yet learning these nonlocal operators remains challenging in machine learning. Integral equations (IEs), which model such nonlocal systems, have wide ranging applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. We introduce Neural Integral Equations (NIE), a method for learning unknown integral operators from data using an IE solver. To improve scalability and model capacity, we also present Attentional Neural Integral Equations (ANIE), which replaces the integral with self-attention. Both models are grounded in the theory of second kind integral equations, where the indeterminate appears both inside and outside the integral operator. We provide theoretical analysis showing how self-attention can approximate integral operators under mild regularity assumptions, further deepening previously reported connections between transformers and integration, and deriving corresponding approximation results for integral operators. Through numerical benchmarks on synthetic and real world data, including Lotka-Volterra, Navier-Stokes, and Burgers' equations, as well as brain dynamics and integral equations, we showcase the models' capabilities and their ability to derive interpretable dynamics embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that ANIE outperforms existing methods, especially for longer time intervals and higher dimensional problems. Our work addresses a critical gap in machine learning for nonlocal operators and offers a powerful tool for studying unknown complex systems with long range dependencies.</description>

      <title>Projected gradient descent accumulates at Bouligand stationary points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm for the problem of minimizing a continuously differentiable function on a nonempty closed subset of a Euclidean vector space. Without further assumptions, this problem is intractable and algorithms are only expected to find a stationary point. PGD generates a sequence in the set whose accumulation points are known to be Mordukhovich stationary. In this paper, these accumulation points are proven to be Bouligand stationary, and even proximally stationary if the gradient is locally Lipschitz continuous. These are the strongest stationarity properties that can be expected for the considered problem.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of a Multi-Population Mean Field Games with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>
