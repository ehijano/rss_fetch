      <title>Energetically efficient, mediated mechanical system for precise control of hoisting operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanical control system for energy efficient and robust hoisting crane operations. The control system efficiently translates the harmonic motion of a spring loaded mediating system into the desired driving of the load, recyling most of the employed energy for subsequent operations. The control output is a shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol borrowed from quantum mechanics. The control system reduces the single operation consuption in realistic working regimes, but it is in cyclical processes where the energetical advantage becomes substantial. The design of the control system and the control output is flexible enough to allow additional optimization of the robustness against perturbations.</description>

      <title>The robustness of composite pulses elucidated by classical mechanics: Stability around the globe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite Pulses (CPs) are widely used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), optical spectroscopy, optimal control experiments and quantum computing to manipulate systems that are well-described by a two-level Hamiltonian. A careful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a desired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude of the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs, several theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In this work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical concept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a canonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to caustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the canonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the refocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different ensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when CPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a rotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP introduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why this CP is effective.</description>

      <title>Impact of a granular mass distribution on the orbit of S2 in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.</description>

      <title>Topological Braiding of Bloch Eigenmodes Protected by Non-Abelian Quaternion Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braiding has attracted significant attention in physics because of its important role in describing the fundamental exchange of particles. Infusing the braiding with topological protection will make it robust against imperfections and perturbations, but such topological braiding is believed to be possible only in interacting quantum systems, e.g., topological superconductors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy of topological braiding that emerges from non-Abelian topological insulators, a class of recently discovered multi-band topological phase. We unveil a mathematical connection between braiding and non-Abelian quaternion invariants, by which Bloch eigenmodes under parallel transport produce braid sequences protected by the non-Abelian band topology. The braiding is also associated with geometric phases quantized over half the Brillouin zone. This new type of non-Abelian topological braiding is experimentally realized in acoustic systems with periodic synthetic dimensions. The results show that the principle discovered here is a new strategy towards topological braiding and can be extended for other types of classical waves and non-interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric sensitivity of modal parameters in wind instrument models: a case study on Saxophone intonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method is a practical approach for modeling plane wave propagation in one-dimensional waveguides. Its simplicity makes it especially attractive for accounting for viscothermal losses, enabling realistic simulations of complex waveguides such as wind instruments. Another strength of this method lies in its fully analytical formulation of wave propagation. Modal parameters naturally arise as by-products of the model, obtained by numerically solving analytical expressions. In this work, the analytical potential of the method is extended by deriving the sensitivity of modal parameters to changes in the geometry of the resonator. These analytical gradients are applied in the context of wind instrument design. A simplified model of a soprano saxophone is used to investigate how octave harmonicity can be optimized through small geometric adjustments. The proposed approach enables predictive adjustments of geometry and offers valuable insight for both sound synthesis and instrument making.</description>

      <title>An alternative interpretation of the Grioli gyroscope suspension points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of all possible regular precessions of a heavy asymmetric body with a fixed point not coinciding with the center of mass. The calculations are done in terms of the rotation matrix, by writing the Euler-Poisson equations with all involved vectors parameterized in the Laboratory frame. It is shown that a regular precession is possible if the suspension point is chosen on the straight lines (lying in the principal plane) which are frontiers of the regions where, as the distance from the center of mass increases, the permutation of intermediate and largest moments of inertia occurs. Like the spin of an electron in quantum mechanics, the frequency of regular precession in classical mechanics turns out to be rigidly fixed by two values, i.e., quantized.</description>

      <title>A Transfer Matrix for the Input Impedance of weakly tapered Cones as of Wind Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A formula for the local acoustical admittance in a conical waveguide with viscous and thermal losses given by Nederveen [(1969) Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments (Frits Knuf, Amsterdam)] is rewritten as an impedance transmission matrix. Based on a self-consistent approximation for the cone, it differs from other one-dimensional transmission matrices used in musical acoustics, which implicitly include the loss model of a cylinder. The resonance frequencies of air columns calculated with this transmission matrix are in better agreement with more comprehensive models. Even for long cones with a slight taper, there is no need to discretize along the axis.</description>
