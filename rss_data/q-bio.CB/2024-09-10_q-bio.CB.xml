      <title>Motion Ordering in Cellular Polar-polar and Polar-nonpolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the difference in motion ordering between cellular systems with and without information transfer to evaluate the effect of the polar--polar interaction through mutual guiding, which enables cells to inform other cells of their moving directions. We compare this interaction with the polar--nonpolar interaction through cell motion triggered by cellular contact, which cannot provide information on the moving directions. We model these interactions on the basis of the cellular Potts model. We calculate the order parameter of the polar direction in the interactions and examine the cell concentration and surface tension conditions of ordering. The results suggest that the polar--polar interaction through mutual guiding efficiently induces the motion ordering in comparison with the polar-nonpolar interaction for contact triggering, except in cases of weak driving. The results also show that the polar--polar interaction efficiently accelerates the collective motion compared with the polar--nonpolar interaction.</description>

      <title>Modelling how lamellipodia-driven cells maintain persistent migration and interact with external barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell motility is fundamental to many biological processes, and cells exhibit a variety of migration patterns. Many motile cell types follow a universal law that connects their speed and persistency, a property that can originate from the intracellular transport of polarity cues due to the global actin retrograde flow. This mechanism was termed the ``Universal Coupling between cell Speed and Persistency"(UCSP). Here we implemented a simplified version of the UCSP mechanism in a coarse-grained ``minimal-cell" model, which is composed of a three-dimensional vesicle that contains curved active proteins. This model spontaneously forms a lamellipodia-like motile cell shape, which is however sensitive and can depolarize into a non-motile form due to random fluctuations or when interacting with external obstacles. The UCSP implementation introduces long-range inhibition, which stabilizes the motile phenotype. This allows our model to describe the robust polarity observed in cells and explain a large variety of cellular dynamics, such as the relation between cell speed and aspect ratio, cell-barrier scattering, and cellular oscillations in different types of geometric confinements.</description>
