      <title>DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Wireless Communications: Fundamentals, Potential, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers (RARs) leverage the quantum coherence of highly excited atoms to overcome the intrinsic physical limitations of conventional radio frequency receivers (RFRs), particularly in sensitivity, and bandwidth. This innovative technology represents a paradigm shift in wireless communication systems. This paper systematically explains the fundamental sensing mechanisms of RARs, contrasts their differences from RFRs in working principles and architectures. We explore their advantages in emerging wireless communication scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communications, quantum Rydberg radar, and quantum space communications. Practical challenges, such as limited instantaneous bandwidth and nonlinear distortion, are identified. To address these issues, mitigation strategies and future research directions are also outlined, supporting the advancement of RAR-aided wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for antenna pattern estimation in satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), utilizing a Narrowband Sweeper Receiver (NSR). By accurately measuring power across individual frequencies within SAR's inherently broadband spectrum, the NSR significantly enhances antenna pattern extraction accuracy. Analytical models and practical experiments conducted using the Cosmo-SkyMed satellite validate the receiver's performance, demonstrating superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to conventional receivers. This research represents a key advancement in SAR technology, offering a robust framework for future satellite calibration and verification methodologies.</description>

      <title>BS-1-to-N: Diffusion-Based Environment-Aware Cross-BS Channel Knowledge Map Generation for Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs. Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.</description>

      <title>A Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Circulator enabled by Non-Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently, channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect, the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal (D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure transmission can be achieved.</description>

      <title>EVMx: An FPGA-Based Smart Contract Processing Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover, the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of EVM-compatible blockchains.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for 6G Near-Field Wireless Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences, alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations (single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Parameter Graph Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs (MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios, effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across various graph signal processing tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Achievable Rate of Satellite Quantum Communication Channel using Deep Autoencoder Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the Deep Autoencoder Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for estimating satellite quantum channel capacity, considering hybrid quantum noise (HQN) and transmission constraints. While GMM is simple and interpretable, DAGMM better captures non-linear variations and noise distributions. Simulations show that DAGMM provides tighter capacity bounds and improved clustering. This introduces the Deep Cluster Gaussian Mixture Model (DCGMM) for high-dimensional quantum data analysis in quantum satellite communication.</description>

      <title>Cellular, Cell-less, and Everything in Between: A Unified Framework for Utility Region Analysis in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions. Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the beamforming strategy.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Transmission of Uncompressed High-Definition Video Via A VCSEL-Based Optical Wireless Link With Ultra-Low Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication (OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi) system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94 Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using off-the-shelf SDI components.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dynamic Parameters for Vietnamese Gender-Independent ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation. These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender independence than the baseline MFCCs.</description>

      <title>Efficient DFT of Zadoff-Chu Sequences using lmFH Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive and visual exposition of the computation of the DFT and IDFT of ZC sequences using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.</description>

      <title>EMORe: Motion-Robust 5D MRI Reconstruction via Expectation-Maximization-Guided Binning Correction and Outlier Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion, compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable Elements of Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Enhancement of Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to exploit movable elements of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance the overall performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Firstly, focusing on a single-user scenario, we reveal the function of movable elements by performance analysis, and then design a joint beamforming and element position optimization scheme. Further, we extend it to a general multi-user scenario, and also propose an element position optimization scheme according to the derived performance expressions. Finally, simulation results confirm that the movement of IRS elements can improve the communication rate and the sensing accuracy, and especially broaden the coverage of ISAC.</description>

      <title>WiRM: Wireless Respiration Monitoring Using Conjugate Multiple Channel State Information and Fast Iterative Filtering in Wi-Fi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring respiratory health with the use of channel state information (CSI) has shown promising results. Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform. Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative, and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable resilience to these common noise sources.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Generative Semantic and Bit Communications in Satellite Networks: Trade-offs in Latency, Generation Quality, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric (SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption, and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM, illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.</description>

      <title>Networked Physical Computing: A New Paradigm for Effective Task Completion via Hypergraph Aided Trusted Task-Resource Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks, developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching (TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.</description>

      <title>Impact of a Lower Limb Exosuit Anchor Points on Energetics and Biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics, muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics. Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However, these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the use of adaptive kernel-based Cohen's class time-frequency distributions (CCTFDs) for cross-term suppression, this paper aims to explore novel adaptive kernel functions for denoising. We integrate Wiener filter principle and the time-frequency filtering mechanism of CCTFD to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive filter-based CCTFD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal automatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error denoising in the WVD domain. Some examples are also carried out to demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CCTFD outperforms some state-of-the-arts in noise suppression.</description>

      <title>Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16593v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</description>

      <title>MVCNet: Multi-View Contrastive Network for Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer blocks to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms nine state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing data on irregular domains. In recent years, many classical techniques in signal processing (SP) have been successfully extended to GSP. Among them, chirp signals play a crucial role in various SP applications. However, graph chirp signals have not been formally defined despite their importance. Here, we define graph chirp signals and establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for their analysis. We propose the graph fractional vertex--frequency energy distribution (GFED), which provides a powerful tool for processing and analyzing graph chirp signals. We introduce the general fractional graph distribution (GFGD), a generalized vertex--frequency distribution, and the reduced interference GFED, which can suppress cross-term interference and enhance signal clarity. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for detecting graph signals through GFED domain filtering, facilitating robust detection and analysis of graph chirp signals in noisy environments. Moreover, this method can be applied to real-world data for denoising more effective than some state-of-the-arts, further demonstrating its practical significance.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic MSE-Optimality of Parametric Bayesian Channel Estimation in mmWave Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean square error (MSE)-optimal estimator is known to be the conditional mean estimator (CME). This paper introduces a parametric channel estimation technique based on Bayesian estimation. This technique uses the estimated channel parameters to parameterize the well-known LMMSE channel estimator. We first derive an asymptotic CME formulation that holds for a wide range of priors on the channel parameters. Based on this, we show that parametric Bayesian channel estimation is MSE-optimal for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or long coherence intervals, i.e., many noisy observations provided within one coherence interval. Numerical simulations validate the derived formulations.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study on Reference-Path-Aided System Calibration for mmWave Bistatic ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been regarded as a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless networks. Compared to monostatic ISAC, bistatic ISAC can eliminate the critical challenge of self-interference cancellation and is well compatible with the existing network infrastructures. However, the synchronization between the transmitter and the sensing receiver becomes a crucial problem. The extracted channel state information (CSI) for sensing under communication synchronization contains different types of system errors, such as the sampling time offset (STO), carrier frequency offset (CFO), and random phase shift, which can severely degrade sensing performance or even render sensing infeasible. To address this problem, a reference-path-aided system calibration scheme is designed for mmWave bistatic ISAC systems, where the line-of-sight (LoS) path can be blocked. By exploiting the delay-angle sparsity feature in mmWave ISAC systems, the reference path, which can be either a LoS or a non-LoS (NLoS) path, is first identified. By leveraging the fact that all the paths suffer the same system errors, the channel parameter extracted from the reference path is utilized to compensate for the system errors in all other paths. A mmWave ISAC system is developed to validate our design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can support precise estimation of Doppler shift and delay, maintaining time-synchronization errors within 1 nanosecond.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper, developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies (such as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning) are analyzed in conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design, synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to autonomous mobility and digital twinning.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Characterization of Micro Doppler Radar Signatures of Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order characteristics of the radar return signal from a swarm of rotor drones. We consider the case of a swarm of identical drones, with each a number of rotors comprised of a number of rotor blades. By considering the orientation and speed of each rotor as stochastic variables, we derive expressions for the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD). The ACF and PSD are in the form of an infinite series with coefficients that drop to zero at a predictable limit. Thus in practical applications, the series may be truncated. As a special case, we show that for deterministic rotor speed, the ACF can be expressed in closed form. We further investigate how system parameters (Blade length, Rotor speed, number of blades, and number of drones) influence the derived expressions for the ACF and PSD.</description>

      <title>On Level Crossings and Fade Durations in von Mises-Fisher Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the second-order statistics of multipath fading channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed scatters. Simple closed-form expressions for the mean Doppler shift and Doppler spread are derived as the key spectral moments that capture the impact of mobility and scattering characteristics on level crossings and fade durations. These expressions are then used to analyze the influence of vMF parameters on the Level-Crossing Rate (LCR) and Average Fade Duration (AFD). The results show that isotropic scattering yields the highest LCR and the lowest AFD, while fading dynamics reduce with the decreasing angular spread of scatterers. Moreover, mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean scattering direction results in a lower LCR than the perpendicular motion, with the difference between the two cases increasing with the higher concentration of scatterers.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Rydberg Atomic Receivers: From Quantum Physics to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic integration of Rydberg atomic receivers into wireless communication systems is proposed, by harnessing the principles of quantum physics in wireless communications. More particularly, we conceive a pair of Rydberg atomic receivers, one incorporates a local oscillator (LO), referred to as an LO-dressed receiver, while the other operates without an LO and is termed an LO-free receiver. The appropriate wireless model is developed for each configuration, elaborating on the receiver's responses to the radio frequency (RF) signal, on the potential noise sources, and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. The developed wireless model conforms to the classical RF framework, facilitating compatibility with established signal processing methodologies. Next, we investigate the associated distortion effects that might occur, specifically identifying the conditions under which distortion arises and demonstrating the boundaries of linear dynamic ranges. This provides critical insights into its practical implementations in wireless systems. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided for characterizing the performance of wireless systems, harnessing this pair of Rydberg atomic receivers. Our results demonstrate that LO-dressed systems achieve a significant SNR gain of approximately 40~50 dB over conventional RF receivers in the standard quantum limit regime. This SNR head-room translates into reduced symbol error rates, enabling efficient and reliable transmission with higher-order constellations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>
