      <title>Electron Heating by Parallel Electric Fields in Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electron heating by magnetic-field-aligned electric fields ($E_\parallel$) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a statistical sample of 140 reconnection outflows, we infer the acceleration potential associated with $E_\parallel$ from the shape of the electron velocity distribution functions. We show that heating by $E_\parallel$ in the reconnection outflow can reach up to ten times the inflow electron temperature. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the acceleration potential scales with the inflow Alfv\'en and electron thermal speeds to maintain quasi-neutrality in the reconnection region. Our results suggest that $E_\parallel$ plays a major role in the ion-to-electron energy partition associated with magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions &gt;25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</description>

      <title>Flaring together: A preferred angular separation between sympathetic flares on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sympathetic solar flares are eruptions that occur nearby in space and time, driven by an apparent interaction between the active regions in which they are triggered. Their statistical existence on the Sun has yet to be firmly established. The main goal of this paper is to identify a statistical signature of sympathetic flares, characterize their properties and determine a potential mechanism driving their interaction. We perform a statistical analysis of a large number of flares observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on Solar Orbiter during solar cycle 24 and 25. We examine the spatiotemporal distribution of consecutive flare pairs across solar cycle phases and hemispheres, along with the propagation velocity of potential causal interactions and the relationship between flare magnitudes. We observe an excess of hemispheric flares separated by about 30 degrees of longitude and triggered in less than 1.5 hours from each other. This peak in angular separation varies with the solar cycle phase and hemisphere. Moreover, we identify a deficit of transequatorial events separated by 25-30 degrees in latitude and less than 5 degrees in longitude, a phenomenon we term unsympathetic flares. We provide strong statistical evidence for the existence of sympathetic flares on the Sun, demonstrating that their occurrence rate reaches approximately 5% across the three instruments used in this study. Additionally, we propose an interpretation of the observed angular scale of the sympathetic phenomenon, based on the separation between magnetic field line footpoints derived from potential field source surface extrapolations.</description>
