      <title>China and G7 in the Current Context of the World Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper analyses trade between the most developed economies of the world. The analysis is based on the previously proposed model of international trade. This model of international trade is based on the theory of general economic equilibrium. The demand for goods in this model is built on the import of goods by each of the countries participating in the trade. The structure of supply of goods in this model is determined by the structure of exports of each country. It is proved that in such a model, given a certain structure of supply and demand, there exists a so-called ideal equilibrium state in which the trade balance of each country is zero. Under certain conditions on the structure of supply and demand, there is an equilibrium state in which each country have a strictly positive trade balance. Among the equilibrium states under a certain structure of supply and demand, there are some that differ from the ones described above. Such states are characterized by the fact that there is an inequitable distribution of income between the participants in the trade. Such states are called degenerate. In this paper, based on the previously proposed model of international trade, an analysis of the dynamics of international trade of 8 of the world's most developed economies is made. It is shown that trade between these countries was not in a state of economic equilibrium. The found relative equilibrium price vector turned out to be very degenerate, which indicates the unequal exchange of goods on the market of the 8 studied countries. An analysis of the dynamics of supply to the market of the world's most developed economies showed an increase in China's share. The same applies to the share of demand.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Makers in Cryptoeconomic Systems: A Taxonomy and Archetypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing automated market makers (AMMs) is crucial for decentralized token exchanges in cryptoeconomic systems. At the intersection of software engineering and economics, AMM design is complex and, if done incorrectly, can lead to financial risks and inefficiencies. We developed an AMM taxonomy for systematically comparing AMM designs and propose three AMM archetypes that meet key requirements for token issuance and exchange. This work bridges software engineering and economic perspectives, providing insights to help developers design AMMs tailored to diverse use cases and foster sustainable cryptoeconomic systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling metaorder impact with a Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Devising models of the limit order book that realistically reproduce the market response to exogenous trades is extremely challenging and fundamental in order to test trading strategies. We propose a novel explainable model for small tick assets, the Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence, which is a variant of the well-known Zero Intelligence model. The main modification is that the probability of limit orders' signs (buy/sell) is not constant but is a function of the exponentially weighted mid-price return, representing the past price dynamics, and can be interpreted as the reaction of traders with reservation prices to the price trend. With numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the model predicts a concave price path during a metaorder execution and to a price reversion after the execution ends, as empirically observed. We analyze in-depth the mechanism at the root of the arising concavity, the components which constitute the price impact in our model, and the dependence of the results on the two main parameters, namely the time scale and the strength of the reaction of traders to the price trend.</description>
