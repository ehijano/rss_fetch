      <title>E. coli do not count single molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms must perform sensory-motor behaviors to survive. What bounds or constraints limit behavioral performance? Previously, we found that the gradient-climbing speed of a chemotaxing Escherichia coli is near a bound set by the limited information they acquire from their chemical environments. Here we ask what limits their sensory accuracy. Past theoretical analyses have shown that the stochasticity of single molecule arrivals sets a fundamental limit on the precision of chemical sensing. Although it has been argued that bacteria approach this limit, direct evidence is lacking. Here, using information theory and quantitative experiments, we find that E. coli's chemosensing is not limited by the physics of particle counting. First, we derive the physical limit on the behaviorally-relevant information that any sensor can get about a changing chemical concentration, assuming that every molecule arriving at the sensor is recorded. Then, we derive and measure how much information E. coli's signaling pathway encodes during chemotaxis. We find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than an ideal sensor limited only by shot noise in particle arrivals. These results strongly suggest that constraints other than particle arrival noise limit E. coli's sensory fidelity.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Versatility of DNA Origami and Electrochemistry for New Sensing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical Biosensors are uniquely positioned to offer real-time in vivo molecular sensing due to their robustness to both biofluids and contaminants found in biofluids, and their adaptability for the detection of different analytes by their use of oligonucleotides or proteins as binding moiety. DNA Origami, the folding of a long DNA scaffold by hundreds of shorter oligonucleotide staple strands, allows the construction of nanoscale molecular objects of essentially arbitrary form, flexibility and functionality. We describe work at the intersection of these two fields and their-hopefully-bright future together.</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>

      <title>Protein Design by Integrating Machine Learning with Quantum Annealing and Quantum-inspired Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The protein design problem involves finding polypeptide sequences folding into a given threedimensional structure. Its rigorous algorithmic solution is computationally demanding, involving a nested search in sequence and structure spaces. Structure searches can now be bypassed thanks to recent machine learning breakthroughs, which have enabled accurate and rapid structure predictions. Similarly, sequence searches might be entirely transformed by the advent of quantum annealing machines and by the required new encodings of the search problem, which could be performative even on classical machines. In this work, we introduce a general protein design scheme where algorithmic and technological advancements in machine learning and quantum-inspired algorithms can be integrated, and an optimal physics-based scoring function is iteratively learned. In this first proof-of-concept application, we apply the iterative method to a lattice protein model amenable to exhaustive benchmarks, finding that it can rapidly learn a physics-based scoring function and achieve promising design performances. Strikingly, our quantum-inspired reformulation outperforms conventional sequence optimization even when adopted on classical machines. The scheme is general and can be easily extended, e.g., to encompass off-lattice models, and it can integrate progress on various computational platforms, thus representing a new paradigm approach for protein design.</description>

      <title>Invisible sweat sensor: ultrathin membrane mimics skin for stress monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidermal skin sensors have emerged as a promising approach for continuous and noninvasive monitoring of vital health signals, but to maximize their performance, these sensors must integrate seamlessly with the skin, minimizing impedance while maintaining the skin's natural protective and regulatory functions.In this study, we introduce an imperceptible sweat sensor that achieves this seamless skin integration through interpenetrating networks formed by a porous, ultra-thin, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanomembrane. Upon attachment to the skin by van der Waals force, the amphiphilic sweat extrudates infuse into the interconnected nanopores inside the hydrophobic UHWMPE nanomembrane, forming "pseudo skin" nanochannels for continuous sweat perspiration. This integration is further enhanced by the osmotic pressure generated during water evaporation. Leveraging the efficient transport of biomarkers through the "skin" channels within the porous membrane, we developed an organic electrochemical transducer (OECT) cortisol sensor via in-situ synthesis of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) within the nanomembrane. This demonstrates the capability to detect cortisol concentrations from 0.05 to 0.5 {\mu}M for seamless monitoring of stress levels. This work represents a significant advancement in self-adhesive sweat sensors that offer imperceptible and real-time non-invasive health monitoring capabilities.</description>

      <title>Buckling by disordered growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buckling instabilities driven by tissue growth underpin key developmental events such as the folding of the brain. Tissue growth is disordered due to cell-to-cell variability, but the effects of this variability on buckling are unknown. Here, we analyse what is perhaps the simplest setup of this problem: the buckling of an elastic rod with fixed ends driven by spatially varying growth. Combining analytical calculations for simple growth fields and numerical sampling of random growth fields, we show that variability can increase as well as decrease the growth threshold for buckling, even when growth variability does not cause any residual stresses. For random growth, we find that the shift of the buckling threshold correlates with spatial moments of the growth field. Our results imply that biological systems can either trigger or avoid buckling by exploiting the spatial arrangement of growth variability.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Localizing axial dense emitters based onsingle-helix point spread function andcompressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the approaches in three-dimensional (3D) single molecule localization microscopy, there are several point spread function (PSF) engineering approaches, in which depth information of molecules is encoded in 2D images. Usually,the molecules are excited sparsely in each raw image. The consequence is that the temporal resolution has to be sacrificed. In order to improve temporal resolution and ensure localization accuracy, we propose a method, SH-CS, based on light needle excitation, detection system with single helix-point spread function (SH-PSF), and compressed sensing (CS). Although the SH-CS method still has a limitation about the molecule density, it is suited for relatively dense molecules. For each light needle scanning position, an SH image of excited molecules is processed with CS algorithm to decode their axial information. Simulations demonstrated, for random distributed 1 ~ 15 molecules in depth range of 4 {\mu}m, the axial localization accuracy is 12.1 nm ~ 73.5 nm. The feasibility of this method is validated by experimental data.</description>

      <title>Inverse modeling of time-delayed interactions via the dynamic-entropy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although instantaneous interactions are unphysical, a large variety of maximum entropy statistical inference methods match the model-inferred and the empirically-measured equal-time correlation functions. Focusing on collective motion of active units, this constraint is reasonable when the interaction timescale is much faster than that of the interacting units, as in starling flocks, yet it fails in a number of counter examples, as in leukocyte coordination (where signalling proteins diffuse among two cells). Here, we relax this assumption and develop a path integral approach to maximum-entropy framework, which includes delay in signalling. Our method is able to infer the strength of couplings and fields, but also the time required by the couplings to completely transfer information among the units. We demonstrate the validity of our approach providing excellent results on synthetic datasets of non-Markovian trajectories generated by the Heisenberg-Kuramoto and Vicsek models equipped with delayed interactions. As a proof of concept, we also apply the method to experiments on dendritic migration, where matching equal-time correlations results in a significant information loss.</description>

      <title>Sequence disorder-induced first order phase transition in confined polyelectrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical mechanical model of a generic flexible polyelectrolyte, comprised of identically charged monomers with long range electrostatic interactions, and short-range interactions quantified by a disorder field along the polymer contour sequence, which is randomly quenched. The free energy and the monomer density profile of the system for no electrolyte screening are calculated in the case of a system composed of two infinite plates with an intervening oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chain. We show that the effect of the contour sequence disorder mediated by short-range interactions leads to an enhanced localization of the polyelectrolyte chain and a first order phase transition at a critical value of the inter-surface spacing. This phase transition results in an abrupt change of the pressure from negative to positive values, effectively eliminating polyelectrolyte mediated bridging attraction.</description>
