      <title>Tractable Weighted First-Order Model Counting with Bounded Treewidth Binary Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. Conditioning WFOMC on evidence -- fixing the truth values of a set of ground literals -- has been shown impossible in time polynomial in the domain size (unless $\mathsf{\#P \subseteq FP}$) even for fragments of logic that are otherwise tractable for WFOMC without evidence. In this work, we address the barrier by restricting the binary evidence to the case where the underlying Gaifman graph has bounded treewidth. We present a polynomial-time algorithm in the domain size for computing WFOMC for the two-variable fragments $\text{FO}^2$ and $\text{C}^2$ conditioned on such binary evidence. Furthermore, we show the applicability of our algorithm in combinatorial problems by solving the stable seating arrangement problem on bounded-treewidth graphs of bounded degree, which was an open problem. We also conducted experiments to show the scalability of our algorithm compared to the existing model counting solvers.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Diffusion Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In diffusion auctions, sellers can leverage an underlying social network to broaden participation, thereby increasing their potential revenue. Specifically, sellers can incentivise participants in their auction to diffuse information about the auction through the network. While numerous variants of such auctions have been recently studied in the literature, the formal verification and strategic reasoning perspectives have not been investigated yet.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce a logical formalism that captures the dynamics of diffusion and its strategic dimension. Second, for such a logic, we provide model-checking procedures that allow one to verify properties as the Nash equilibrium, and that pave the way towards checking the existence of sellers' strategies. Third, we establish computational complexity results for the presented algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Natural Language Formalization and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.</description>

      <title>HHLPar: Automated Theorem Prover for Parallel Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tool called HHLPar for verifying hybrid systems modelled in Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP). HHLPar is built upon a Hybrid Hoare Logic for HCSP, which is able to reason about continuous-time properties of differential equations, as well as communication and parallel composition of parallel HCSP processes with the help of parameterised trace assertions and their synchronization. The logic was formalised and proved to be sound in Isabelle/HOL, which constitutes a trustworthy foundation for the verification conducted by HHLPar. HHLPar implements the Hybrid Hoare Logic in Python and supports automated verification: On one hand, it provides functions for symbolically decomposing HCSP processes, generating specifications for separate sequential processes and then composing them via synchronization to obtain the final specification for the whole parallel HCSP processes; On the other hand, it is integrated with external solvers for handling differential equations and real arithmetic properties. We have conducted experiments on a simplified cruise control system to validate the performance of the tool.</description>

      <title>Input-based Three-valued Abstraction Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12668v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), Three-Valued Abstraction Refinement (TVAR) is able to verify all properties of the mu-calculus. We present a novel algorithmic framework for TVAR that employs a simulator-like approach to build and refine the abstract state space with input-based splitting. This leads to a state space formalism that is much simpler than in previous TVAR frameworks, which use modal transitions. We implemented the framework in our open-source tool machine-check and verified properties of machine-code systems for the AVR architecture, showing the ability to verify systems and mu-calculus properties not verifiable by naive model checking or CEGAR, respectively. This is the first practical use of TVAR for machine-code verification.</description>

      <title>Localized RETE for Incremental Graph Queries with Nested Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing size of graph-based modeling artifacts in model-driven engineering calls for techniques that enable efficient execution of graph queries. Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead.
  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph.
  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and with queries and data from an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable overhead in unfavorable cases.</description>

      <title>A Personalised Formal Verification Framework for Monitoring Activities of Daily Living of Older Adults Living Independently in Their Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models, personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context. We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants, highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults ageing in place.</description>

      <title>Discussion Graph Semantics of First-Order Logic with Equality for Reasoning about Discussion and Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make three contributions. First, we formulate a discussion-graph semantics for first-order logic with equality, enabling reasoning about discussion and argumentation in AI more generally than before. This addresses the current lack of a formal reasoning framework capable of handling diverse discussion and argumentation models. Second, we generalise Dung's notion of extensions to cases where two or more graph nodes in an argumentation framework are equivalent. Third, we connect these two contributions by showing that the generalised extensions are first-order characterisable within the proposed discussion-graph semantics. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's extensions is an immediate consequence. We furthermore show that the set of all generalised extensions (acceptability semantics), too, are first-order characterisable. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's acceptability semantics is an immediate consequence.</description>
