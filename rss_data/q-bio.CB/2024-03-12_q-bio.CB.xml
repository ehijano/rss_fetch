      <title>Modeling iPSC-derived Endothelial Cell Transition in Tumor Angiogenesis using Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor angiogenesis concerns the development of new blood vessels supplying the necessary nutrients for the further development of existing tumor cells. The entire process is complex, involving the production and consumption of chemicals, endothelial cell transitions as well as cell interactions, divisions, and migrations. Microfluidic cell culture platform has been used to study angiogenesis of endothelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-ECs) for a physiological relevant micro-environment. In this paper, we elaborate on how to define a pipeline for simulating the transformation and process that an iPSC-derived endothelial cell goes through in this biological scenario. We leverage the robustness and simplicity of Petri nets for modeling the cell transformation and associated constraints. The environmental and spacial factors are added using custom 2-dimensional grids. Although the pipeline does not capture the entire complexity of tumor angiogenesis, we are able to capture the essence of endothelial cell transitions in tumor angiogenesis using this conceptually simplified solution.</description>

      <title>An in-silico approach to meniscus tissue regeneration: Modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model the dynamics of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes evolving in a nonwoven polyethylene terephtalate (PET) scaffold impregnated with hyaluron and supplied with a differentiation medium. The scaffold and the cells are assumed to be contained in a bioreactor with fluid perfusion. The differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes favors the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and is influenced by fluid stress. The model takes deformations of ECM and PET scaffold into account. The scaffold structure is explicitly included by statistical assessment of the fibre distribution from CT images. The effective macroscopic equations are obtained by appropriate upscaling from dynamics on lower (microscopic and mesoscopic) scales and feature in the motility terms an explicit cell diffusion tensor encoding the assessed anisotropic scaffold structure. Numerical simulations show its influence on the overall cell and tissue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Complementing cell taxonomies with a multicellular functional analysis of tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of single-cell molecular profiling coupled with spatial technologies has enabled charting cellular heterogeneity in reference tissues and in disease. This new wave of molecular data has highlighted the expected diversity of single-cell dynamics upon shared external queues and spatial organizations. However, little is known about the relationship between single cell heterogeneity and the emergence and maintenance of robust multicellular processes in developed tissues and its role in (patho)physiology. Here, we present emerging computational modeling strategies that use increasingly available large-scale cross-condition single cell and spatial datasets, to study multicellular organization in tissues and complement cell taxonomies. This perspective should enable us to better understand how cells within tissues collectively process information and adapt synchronized responses in disease contexts and to bridge the gap between structural changes and functions in tissues.</description>

      <title>An agent-based modelling framework to study growth mechanisms in EGFR-L858R mutant alveolar type II cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in never-smoker patients. However, these mutations are not always carcinogenic, and have recently been reported in histologically normal lung tissue from patients with and without lung cancer. To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem cells, we grew murine alveolar type-II organoids monoclonally in a 3D Matrigel. Our experiments showed that the \textit{EGFR-L858R} mutation induced a change in organoid structure: mutated organoids displayed more `budding', in comparison to non-mutant controls, which were nearly spherical. We perform on-lattice computational simulations, which suggest that this can be explained by the concentration of division amongst a small number of cells on the surface of the organoid, which may arise from several possible biological mechanisms. These results suggest that the L858R mutation produces structures which expand quickly from surface protrusions. We are currently unable to distinguish the cell-based mechanisms that lead to this spatial heterogeneity in growth, but suggest a number of future experiments which could be used to do so. We suggest that the likelihood of L858R-fuelled tumorigenesis is affected not just by random fluctuations in cell fitness, but by whether the mutation arises in a spatial environment that allows mutant cells to reproduce without being forced to encounter each other. These data may have implications for cancer prevention strategies and for understanding NSCLC progression.</description>
