      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method for Three-Dimensional Flow Fields Around Buildings for Real-Time Prediction of Urban Micrometeorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for building-resolving micrometeorology simulations, which considerably reduces the computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input of low-resolution (LR) simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution (HR) inferences. The CNNs are trained using HR simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage. This learning approach separates the flow scales to be inferred in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred HR atmospheric flows, reducing errors by about 50% for air temperature and 60\% for wind velocity compared to the LR simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach allowed for localized HR inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to 12% during the training phase. The total wall-clock time for a 60-min prediction was reduced to about 9.92 min, which was approximately 3.2% (i.e., a 31-fold speedup) of the HR simulation time (309 min). The proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of real-time micrometeorology predictions in urban areas with a combination of physics-based and data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Direct in-situ observations of wave-induced floe collisions in the deeper Marginal Ice Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean waves propagating through the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the pack ice are strongly attenuated. This attenuation is critical for protecting sea ice from energetic wave events that could otherwise lead to sea ice break-up and dislocation over large areas. Despite the importance of waves-in-ice attenuation, the exact physical mechanisms involved, and their relative importance, are still uncertain. Here we present for the first time direct in situ measurements of floe-floe interactions under the influence of waves, including collisions between adjacent floes. The collision events we report are aligned with the incoming wave direction, and phase-locked to the wave signal, which indicates that the individual collisions we detect are wave-induced. The observations demonstrate that wave attenuation by wave-induced floe-floe collisions, which have been studied in idealized laboratory and field experiments in the outer MIZ, are indeed a likely source of wave energy dissipation deep inside the MIZ as well.</description>
