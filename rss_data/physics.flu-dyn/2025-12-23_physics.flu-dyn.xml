      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Computational considerations for the prediction of airfoil Stall Flutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of a NACA0012 undergoing Stall Flutter Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO) across distinct fluid dynamics regimes. It accurately models Small Amplitude Oscillations (SAO) in the transitional Reynolds regime and Large Amplitude Oscillations (LAO) in the moderate regime, observed in different experimental campaigns. The SAO analysis servs as a verification of the computational framework against established numerical benchmarks. Crucially, the LAO simulations represent the first documented prediction across the full experimental velocity range correlated against available measured data, addressing a significant literature gap. The predictions fidelity relies on rigorous computational criteria defined through a detailed sensitivity analysis. This demonstrated numerical requirements significantly more demanding than those typically employed for computing static polars or simulating dynamic pitching motion of rigid airfoils, underscoring the severity of the aeroelastic problem. Overall, the results show strong qualitative agreement with experimental observations, successfully reproducing key dynamic stall mechanics and bifurcation phenomena. Quantitatively, however, the simulation systematically over--predicts the critical onset velocity and under--predicts the LCO amplitudes, a discrepancy attributed to reduced aerodynamic excitation peaks.</description>

      <title>Performance of Flamelet Models with Epsilon Tracking for Diffusion Flame Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the physical consistency of the conventional Flamelet Progress Variable (FPV) model for diffusion flame simulations and and introduces a new compressible flamelet formulation that employs the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\epsilon$, as the tracking variable. Two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are conducted for a reacting, transonic, turbulent mixing layer to assess the coupling between resolved-scale and subgrid flamelet quantities, with emphasis on the role of strain rate. The FPV model is found to decouple resolved-scale and subgrid strain rates, leading to the preferential selection of equilibrium flamelet solutions in regions of high strain and resulting in nonphysical predictions of heat release and species composition. The proposed $\epsilon$-based formulation restores physical consistency by relating the subgrid flamelet strain rate to $\epsilon$, allowing the flamelet to respond to the local resolved-scale strain field. The inclusion of resolved-scale species transport enables advective and diffusive redistribution of products across locally quenched regions. The results indicate that $\epsilon$ offers a physically consistent tracking variable that connects the sub-grid flamelet model to resolved-scale RANS computations.</description>

      <title>Flamelet Model with Epsilon Tracking in a Turbine Stator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combustion within a two-dimensional turbine stator passage is numerically investigated in the context of the turbine-burner concept using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes framework coupled with a novel flamelet model. The formulation links resolved-scale turbulence quantities with subgrid flamelet dynamics through the local turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\epsilon$, which determines the flamelet inflow strain rate. For the first time, combustion of JP-5 is considered in a turbine stator passage as a practical fuel. This is achieved by solving transport equations for 14 major species on the resolved scale, while chemical source terms are obtained from precomputed flamelet libraries based on the HyChem A3 mechanism comprising 119 species and 841 elementary reactions. Model performance is assessed against methane combustion using both a one-step kinetics model and an $\epsilon$-based flamelet formulation employing a 13-species skeletal mechanism. The $\epsilon$-based formulation predicts lower peak flame temperatures due to dissociation effects and approximately 50\% lower net chemical energy addition per unit mass compared with the one-step model, as a result of flame stand-off and downstream strain-rate-induced quenching. For JP-5, the simulations capture combined endothermic pyrolysis and exothermic oxidation processes, leading to vertically displaced reaction zones, increased near-wall temperatures, and larger resolved-scale reaction regions due to the higher flamelet flammability limit relative to methane.</description>

      <title>Geometric Rectification of Surface Activity Induced Flow in Confined Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional pressure-driven flow obeys Poiseuille's law, with the mean velocity scaling as $u \propto r^2$ under confinement. Here we identify a distinct transport mode driven by spatially structured surface activity (e.g., mass exchange or boundary slip gradients), which is rectified by geometric asymmetry into a net axial flux. Using a minimal exchange model, we show that this mechanism exhibits four defining signatures that are inconsistent with classical lubrication theory: (i) an inverted confinement scaling $u \propto r^{-1}$ (``narrower-is-faster''); (ii) leading-order viscosity independence; (iii) macroscopic length amplification ($Q \propto L$); and (iv) linear superposition with pressure-driven flows. These results establish confined channels as active geometric rectifiers and provide a unified framework for surface-induced transport from microfluidic to biological settings.</description>

      <title>An energetically and thermodynamically consistent Boussinesq model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boussinesq approximation is a cornerstone of geophysical fluid dynamics, yet its thermodynamic and energetic underpinnings have remained ambiguous. In standard formulations, the links with the fully compressible Navier--Stokes equations are obscured, internal energy is only implicit, and the representation of diffusion and irreversibility remains \textit{ad hoc}. Here we derive a new Boussinesq model in a fully traceable way from the two-component compressible Navier-Stokes equations, ensuring exact energy conservation and consistent thermodynamics. Assuming a linear equation of state, our model treats density as a proxy for specific volume, distinguishes in-situ and potential temperature explicitly, and incorporates diffusive fluxes that homogenise the correct thermodynamic potentials, ensuring consistent non-negative entropy production. The result clarifies the status of gravitational potential energy, resolves ambiguities surrounding salinity--entropy coupling, and retains the small terms carriers of key information about thermodynamics. Alongside this, we introduce an exact thermodynamically soundproof (TS) model whose weak diabatic divergence highlights the role of compressibility effects in stratified turbulence. Together, these models provide a transparent framework that reconciles classical approximations with compressible energetics, offering better-defined pathways for analysing stratified mixing, mixing efficiency, and the energy budgets of geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the effects of atmospheric dynamics on wakes with a controlled synthetic inflow methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Winds in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) display a wide range of velocity profiles and turbulence properties that affect wind turbine wake dynamics. However, standard concurrent-precursor large eddy simulations (LES) often neglect phenomena such as mesoscale patterns, limiting the range and controllability of inflow parameters that can be studied. Here, we propose a synthetic inflow LES method with high inflow controllability to allow parameters such as shear, turbulence, and Coriolis effects to be varied independently, facilitating the efficient exploration of wake dynamics across the full range of conditions observed in the field. The synthetic inflow method faithfully reconstructs wake dynamics when compared with standard concurrent-precursor LES. We then run a suite of over 600 LES cases to investigate the ABL processes that most affect wake dynamics. We find that wake recovery strongly depends on inflow wind veer, especially at low turbulence intensities, due to the elongation of the skewed wake. Furthermore, we identify a novel scaling relation that collapses wake deflections and dynamics onto the combination of shear and veer. The suite of LES cases elucidates ABL regimes and wake dynamics where current and future wind turbines may operate, building toward improved wake modeling for wind farm design and control.</description>

      <title>Data-driven detached-eddy simulations based on explicit algebraic stress expressions for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a data-driven explicit algebraic stress-based detached-eddy simulation (DES) method. Despite the widespread use of data-driven methods in model development for both Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulations (LES), their applications to DES remain limited. The challenge mainly lies in the absence of modelled stress data, the requirement for proper length scales in RANS and LES branches, and the maintenance of a reasonable switching behaviour. The data-driven DES method is constructed based on the algebraic stress equation. The control of RANS/LES switching is achieved through the eddy viscosity in the linear part of the modelled stress, under the $\ell^2-\omega$ DES framework. Three model coefficients associated with the pressure-strain terms and the LES length scale are represented by a neural network as functions of scalar invariants of velocity gradient. The neural network is trained using velocity data with the ensemble Kalman method, thereby circumventing the requirement for modelled stress data. Moreover, the baseline coefficient values are incorporated as additional reference data to ensure reasonable switching behaviour. The proposed approach is evaluated on two challenging turbulent flows, i.e., the secondary flow in a square duct and the separated flow over a bump. The trained model achieves significant improvements in predicting mean flow statistics compared to the baseline model. This is attributed to improved predictions of the modelled stress. The trained model also exhibits reasonable switching behaviour, enlarging the LES region to resolve more turbulent structures. Furthermore, the model shows satisfactory generalization capabilities for both cases in similar flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Discrete inflow and drainage dynamics of a thin film over a stalagmite of variable shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stalagmites in karstic caves preserve valuable palaeoclimate records through calcium-rich layered deposits, presenting curvature variations both across and within individual stalagmites. Stalagmites always remain covered by a thin water film fed by a discrete inflow of drops, which bring in new ions in solution for the stalagmites to grow. However, the gravity-induced drainage of this film and its response to the stalagmite underneath shape and the discrete drop inflow remain poorly characterised in existing growth models. To address these limitations, we develop a theoretical framework that captures the combined effects of shape curvature and discrete drop inflow on thin film drainage dynamics, starting from Reynolds lubrication theory expressed in curvilinear coordinates. From there, we show that the limiting cases of thickness-dominated and inclination-dominated drainage translate into distinct scaling laws for both the front propagation position and stationary film thickness. We further validate these results by numerically solving the governing equations. Finally, experimental measurements conducted in both cave and lab settings confirm the predicted stationary film thickness. Our findings provide insights into the influence of substrate shape and inflow dynamics on thin film drainage, with implications for stalagmite growth modelling and other gravity-driven surface flows.</description>

      <title>Formation of external particle jets on a spherical particle bed subjected to strong explosive loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the mechanism for the formation of external particle jets on a spherical particle bed subjected to strong explosive loading, revealing a critical dependence on particle size. Under strong explosive loading, the formation of external particle jets is primarily driven by a drag-coupled mechanism. We conducted Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations, with up to $2048^3$ effective cells and $1.8$ million tracked parcels on an adaptive mesh, for both small- and large-particle cases. Pronounced jets are observed only with small particles, alongside accelerated bed thickening. By defining characteristic inner and outer radii, the particle bed thickness evolution is quantified, showing an initial linear growth followed by a nonlinear deceleration. Particle dynamics analysis indicates that drag force dominates particle motion and jet formation during the nonlinear stage. The initial angular non-uniformity of the particle bed induces a non-uniform gas radial velocity. Through drag coupling, this flow asymmetry generates a radial velocity difference in small particles, thereby promoting pronounced jet formation, whereas large particles resist this drag-induced effect. The greater drag-induced deceleration on smaller particles leads to an increased velocity difference across the particle bed, explaining the accelerated thickening. A characteristic radius model that integrates the Gurney model for the linear stage with a drag-dominated deceleration model for the nonlinear stage is established and shows good agreement with numerical results across different particle sizes.</description>

      <title>Unifying formalism and closures for coarse-grained approaches to turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of an unifying paradigm for the assessment and development of closed forms of the coarse-grained Navier-Stokes equations in approaches ranging from the statistical to the scale-resolving ones. It consists in the exact formalism provided by the temporally filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The fundamental idea is that the smoothing action of turbulent stresses can be described as a temporal filtering operator implicitly applied to the solution. Contrary to the average and spatial filtering operators, the temporal filter is an unifying operator smoothly varying within the statistical and scale-resolving realms. The potential of the temporal filtering paradigm is here highlighted by unveiling relevant algebraic properties and by deriving a new class of turbulence closures. A dynamic procedure is derived and shown to provide an unifying closure for both scale-resolving and statistical approaches. Results show that an improved physics is captured. Challenging phenomena such as the laminar to turbulence transition and the dependence of separation and reattachment on free-stream turbulence applied through boundary conditions are captured.</description>

      <title>A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ferro-hydrodynamics of droplet necking filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the necking, filament thinning, and pinchoff dynamics of ferrofluid droplets within a magnetic field, via a simple and low-cost experimental method. In our studies, both the Ohnesorge number Oh and the Deborah number De are O1, a typically inaccessible regime with conventional extensional rheometers. Under magnetic forcing, the nanoparticles assemble into field aligned, chainlike structures, that generate a tunable magnetoelastic response, and markedly alter the extensional flow. Although behaving as Newtonian liquids in the absence of a magnetic field, the field induces extensional thickening, and the emergence of beads on a string BOAS structures in the ferrofluid filaments, a non-Newtonian signature. By combining controlled elongation with high speed imaging, we directly quantify the magnetic field-dependent extensional viscosity and relaxation time. Our findings underscore how magnetically induced microstructures govern filament stability and extensional dynamics in ferrofluids.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation mechanisms in an acoustically-driven slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify how incident acoustic energy is converted into vortical motion and viscous dissipation for a two-dimensional plane-wave passing through a slit geometry. We perform direct numerical simulations over a broad parameter space in incident sound pressure level (ISPL), Strouhal number (St), and Reynolds number (Re). Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) yields energy-ranked coherent structures at each frequency, from which we construct mode-by-mode fields for spectral kinetic energy (KE) and viscous loss (VL) components to examine the mechanisms of acoustic absorption. At ISPL=150dB, the acoustic-hydrodynamic energy conversion is highest when the acoustic displacement amplitude is comparable to the slit thickness, corresponding to a Keulegan-Carpenter number of order unity. In this regime, the oscillatory boundary layer undergoes periodic separation, resulting in vortex shedding that dominates acoustic damping. VL accounts for 20-60% of the KE contribution. For higher acoustic frequencies, the confinement of the Stokes layer produces X-shaped near-slit modes, reducing the total energy input by approximately 50%. The influence of Re depends on amplitude. At ISPL=150dB, larger Re values correspond to suppressed broadband fluctuations and sharpened harmonic peaks. At ISPL = 120dB, the boundary layers remain attached, vortex shedding is weak, absorption monotonically scales with viscosity, and the Re- and St-dependencies become comparable. Across all conditions, more than 99% of the VL is confined to a compact region surrounding the slit mouth. The KE-VL spectra describe parameter regimes that enhance or suppress acoustic damping in slit geometries, providing a physically interpretable basis for acoustic-based design.</description>

      <title>Nondiffusive transport of inertial heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport behavior of tungsten impurities with finite inertia in drift-wave turbulence using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Unlike previous tracer-based models, our simulations reveal a transition to non-diffusive dynamics for a range of charge states. This novel mechanism offers a turbulence-driven route to core impurity accumulation. This finding underscores the nontrivial role of particle inertia in impurity dynamics and has strong implications for impurity control in future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>A least-squares meshfree method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations: A satisfactory solenoidal velocity field via a staggered-variable arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible flow solvers based on strong-form meshfree methods represent arbitrary geometries without the need for a global mesh system. However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Global Regular Solutions of the Multidimensional Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in the theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is whether regular spherically symmetric flows can develop singularities -- such as cavitation or implosion -- in finite time. A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1,\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear partial differential equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Geometry-dependent Ekman layer approximations on curved domains: L^{\infty} convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ekman boundary layer is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that describes fluid motion near boundaries affected by Earth's rotation. Most theoretical studies have simplified their analysis by assuming a planar boundary surface, resulting in limited exploration of structures with general smooth boundary conditions. Investigating the impact of boundary geometry in the Ekman boundary layer is essential, as initially suggested by J.L. Lions and further examined in Masmoudi's study [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432-483] under small amplitude periodic boundary conditions. This paper clarifies how boundary geometry influences flow fields and characterizes its effects on near-boundary layer flow. We construct a class of multi-scale approximate solutions based on the boundary's geometric features and establish their convergence in the L^{\infty} framework. Our findings do not require a small-amplitude assumption, only an upper bound on the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. Notably, when the boundary is planar, our approach aligns with existing studies. Additionally, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, we derive a limiting-state system dependent on boundary geometric parameters. These contributions extend the theoretical understanding of boundary-layer interactions to general curved geometries and have possible applications in atmospheric, oceanic, and other geophysical flow contexts.</description>

      <title>Is the active suspension in a complex viscoelastic fluid more chaotic or more ordered?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitat of microorganisms is typically complex and viscoelastic. A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Cut-Cell Two-Fluid Method for Two-Phase Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.</description>

      <title>The effect of split endcaps on the flow dynamics in a tall Taylor-Couette setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of axial boundaries, or endcaps are of fundamental interest in many Taylor-Couette (TC) flow experiments. A main challenge in those experiments has been to minimize these effects, which can substantially alter the flow structure compared to the axially unbounded idealized case. Therefore, understanding and disentangling the influence of endcaps on the TC flow dynamics is essential for the unambiguous interpretation of experimental results, particularly when other dynamical processes (instabilities) in TC flows are involved. In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic evolution of a quasi-Keplerian TC flow in the presence of split endcaps for high Reynolds numbers, $Re$, up to $2\times 10^5$, which are larger than those considered in related previous studies. At these $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile without endcaps, resulting in about $15\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of the cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability near the endcaps, the bulk flow remains nearly axially independent and exhibits overall Rayleigh-stability. We characterize the scalings of the Ekman and Stewartson layer sizes with $Re$ as well as examine the effect of the ratio of the outer to inner cylinders' angular velocities on the flow. The implications of these findings for ongoing magnetorotational instability (MRI) experiments based on the similar axially bounded TC setup are also discussed. Specifically, it is shown that when imposing a constant axial magnetic field in all the considered configurations, the flow profile modified by the endcaps lowers the critical threshold for the onset of MRI that in turn can facilitate its emergence and detection in those experiments.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study On Flashing-Induced Instabilities In An Open Natural Circulation System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The natural circulation system (NCS) uses gravity pressure drop caused by density differences in the loop to generate the driving force without any external mechanical devices, which has been widely applied to the design of the nuclear reactor system and the passive safety system due to its simple structure, high intrinsic safety, and strong heat discharge capacity. However, the low-pressure condition can lead to a two-phase flow and make the flow characteristics in the NCS more complex. Flashing-induced instability occurring in the open NCS will cause the system structural vibration as well as mechanical damage and bring safety problems. The study on flashing-flow behaviors in an open NPS has been conducted experimentally in this paper. High-speed camera, thermal needle probe and wire-mesh sensor were adopted to record the flow pattern and measure the void fraction in the polycarbonate visualization riser section. In the start-up process, with the inlet temperature in the riser section increasing, the open NCS has experienced single-phase stable flow, intermittent oscillation between single-phase and two-phase, high subcooling two-phase stable flow, flashing-induced instabilities flow, and low subcooling two-phase stable flow. The flow pattern evolution of flow flashing goes through bubble flow, cap-slug flow, churn flow and wispy annular flow, in which the length of churn can account for more than 40% length of the two-phase regime. The flash number Nflash is used to divide the region of flashing-induced instabilities. It is found that the open NCS is in a stable two-phase flow when the flash number at the outlet of the riser section N_{flash,out} = 4\sim 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, which allows to solve numerically the dynamics of a viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space. Unlike finite-element libraries present in the literature, IRENE can handle two-dimensional open surfaces with a wide range of boundary conditions, and inter-surface obstacles with any shapes, and is built upon the user-friendly and versatile finite element computational software (FEniCS). Also, the library can describe a wide range of physical regimes--both low-Reynolds-number and inertia-dominated ones--capturing the complex coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results, and demonstrate its capabilities through physical examples. Overall, IRENE provides a versatile and efficient tool for understanding fluid-layer dynamics on multiple physical scales, from flows of lipidic membranes on a microscopic level, to fluid flows on a macroscopic scale, to atmospheric air flows on a planetary level.</description>

      <title>Inflection point instability in Hartmann channel flow with variable electric conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of a flow of an electrically conducting, incompressible fluid in a channel with an imposed uniform wall-normal magnetic field and electrically insulating walls is studied using linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. The novelty of the system, which differentiates it from the classical Hartmann channel flow, is that, as in some technological applications of liquid metals, the electric conductivity and viscosity of the fluid vary across the channel. This variation is found to have a strong influence on the stability characteristics of the flow. Specifically, a linear variation in electric conductivity significantly alters the base velocity profile, leading to pronounced asymmetry and the development of inflection points. When this transformation is sufficiently strong, the flow becomes linearly unstable at Reynolds numbers much lower than the threshold for the linear instability of the Hartmann channel flow. The instability exhibits distinct features: a large typical axial wavelength and the localization of perturbation growth in the channel core. The characteristics of this instability suggest a mechanism similar to the classical inviscid inflection-point instability of one-dimensional velocity profiles. The resulting transition to turbulence is demonstrated in direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>The study of coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering in multiple flow regimes using unified gas-kinetic scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) holds great promise for the characterization of gas properties and the investigation of gas kinetic processes. The CRBS spectrum exhibits a strong dependence on the Knudsen number (Kn), revealing its inherently multiscale nature. In the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), collisions are intrinsically coupled with free transport during flux construction, endowing the method with distinct multiscale capabilities. Specifically, the UGKS reduces to a Boltzmann solver when the relaxation time is greater than or equal to the time step, and to the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS)-a Navier-Stokes solver-when the relaxation time is much smaller than the time step, thereby accommodating flow regimes without constraints on the molecular mean free path or collision time. In this study, the UGKS is extended to simulate CRBS phenomena, with the governing equation formulated based on the BGK-Shakhov model. Detailed derivations are provided. To account for the additional perturbation source term, a second-order accurate numerical algorithm is developed using the Strang splitting method within the UGKS framework. The proposed model is validated against argon CRBS experiments, demonstrating excellent agreement. Building on this validated framework, the impact of incident signal intensity on CRBS spectra across a range of Knudsen numbers is systematically examined, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. This work broadens the applicability of CFD-based CRBS simulations and provides a reliable numerical foundation for exploring high-intensity, multiscale gas-kinetic phenomena in future research.</description>

      <title>Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>
