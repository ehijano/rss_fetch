      <title>Which gravitational lensing degeneracies are broken in wave-optics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies gravitational lensing degeneracies in the wave-optics regime, focusing on lensed gravitational waves (GWs). Considering lensing degeneracies as re-scaling (or transformations) of arrival time delay surface, we can divide them into local and global types. Local degeneracies only affect the time delay surface in localized regions, whereas global degeneracies re-scale the whole time delay surface by a constant while keeping the various observed image properties unchanged. We show that local degeneracies can be broken in the wave-optics regime since lensing effects become sensitive to the overall arrival time delay surface and not only to the time delay values at the image positions. On the other hand, global degeneracies (such as similarity transformation and mass-sheet degeneracy) multiply the amplification factor by a constant factor (let us say, $\lambda$). However, in GW lensing, as the GW signal amplitude depends on the source distance, it turns out that $\lambda$ is completely degenerate with the Hubble constant, similar to what we see in geometric optics. Hence, with the lensing of GWs, global degeneracies are as hard to break in wave optics as they are in geometric optics.</description>

      <title>Massive Scalar Perturbations and Quasi-Resonance of Rotating Black Hole in Analog Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was reported that the optical field fluctuations in self-defocusing media can be described by sound waves propagating in a two-dimensional photon-fluid which is controlled by the driving laser beam. The photon-fluid can be regarded as the background where the sound waves propagate in the way like a scalar field propagating in curved spacetime, thus providing a platform to study physics in analog gravity. In this analog gravity model, to be more specific, in the analog rotating black hole background, we study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massive scalar field perturbations, as a natural extension of the recent work on the massless QNMs in photon-fluid. We analyze the properties of the spectrum of fundamental QNMs which are calculated by Continued Fraction Method and WKB approximation method. We also investigate the quasi-resonance and find that it may exist in this analog gravity model. The existence of quasi-resonance is important to study the QNMs in analog gravity apparatus due to its slow damping rate and longevity which give us better opportunity to probe and study it in laboratory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>On the analytic generalization of particle deflection in the weak field regime and shadow size in light of EHT constraints for Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an analytic generalization of the weak field deflection angle (WDA) is derived by utilizing the current non-asymptotically flat generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The derived formula is valid for any Schwarzschild-like spacetime, which deviates from the classical Schwarzschild case through some constant parameters. This work provided four examples in the context of bumblebee gravity theory, and one example from a black hole surrounded with soliton dark matter, where some results are new, and some agreed with existing literature. The WDA formula provided a simple calculation, where approximations based on some conditions can be done directly on it, skipping the preliminary steps. For the shadow size analysis, it is shown how it depends solely on the parameter associated with the metric coefficient in the time coordinate. A general formula for the constrained parameter is also derived based on the Event Horizon Collaboration (EHT) observational results. Finally, the work realized further possible generalizations on other black hole models, such as RN-like, dS/AdS-like black hole solutions, and even black hole solutions in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Wormhole formations in the galactic halos supported by dark matter models and global monopole charge within $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00507v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the possibility of traversable wormholes in the galactic region supported by dark matter (DM) models and global monopole charge in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. To understand the features of the wormholes, we comprehensively studied wormhole solutions with various redshift functions under different $f(Q)$ models. We obtained wormhole shape functions for Pseudo Isothermal (PI) and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profiles under linear $f(Q)$ gravity. In contrast, we employed an embedding class I approach for the non-linear $f(Q)$ models to investigate wormholes. We noticed that our obtained shape functions satisfy the flare-out conditions under an asymptotic background for each DM profile. Moreover, we checked the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$ and noticed the influences of the global monopole's parameter $\eta$ in the violation of energy conditions, especially null energy conditions. Further, for the non-linear case, we observed that wormhole solutions could not exist for $f(Q)=Q+mQ^n$, $f(Q)=Q+\frac{\beta}{Q}$, and $f(Q)=\alpha_1+\beta_1 \log(Q)$ under embedding class I approach. Finally, we study the amount of exotic matter via the volume integral quantifier technique for the linear $f(Q)$ model, and we confirm that a small amount of exotic matter is required to sustain the traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,G,T)$ Gravity in the Quintom model, and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I consider a $f(R, G, T)$ modified gravity model where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $G$ denotes the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and $T$ signifies the trace of the stress-energy tensor. This model is coupled with two distinct types of scalar fields. In the flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe, the necessary conditions for a successful bounce are achieved. Under these circumstances, it is demonstrated that the equation of state (EoS) parameter cannot cross the phantom divider when only the inflaton scalar field is considered. Appropriate conditions to preserve the conservation of energy law are obtained. The absence of radiation domination is confirmed by referencing one of the collections of the Planck 2018 report. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that this is a general model, encompassing other models such as Weyl conformal geometry and the inflation epoch. Numerical calculations and graphs are used to confirm the results.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a multi-component stochastic gravitational-wave background with the TianQin + LISA network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-borne detectors, including TianQin and Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA), are tasked with the simultaneous observation of Galactic foreground, astrophysical and cosmological stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs). For the first time, we employ a space-borne detector network to identify the multi-component SGWB. Specifically, we develop a tailored likelihood for cross-correlation detection with such networks. Combined with the likelihood, we use the simulated datasets of the TianQin + LISA network to conduct model selection and parameter estimation. Our results indicate that, after 4 years of operation, the network could detect a single SGWB from either astrophysical or cosmological origins, with an energy density $\Omega_{\rm ast/cos}$ (10 mHz) on the order of $10^{-12}$, despite the presence of a Galactic foreground. Furthermore, to distinguish the cosmological background from both a Galactic foreground and the expected astrophysical background, the energy density $\Omega_{\rm cos}$ should reach around $2\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Look beyond additivity and extensivity of entropy for black hole and cosmological horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of explored vastly recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and the analytical continuation of non-self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review the analytical continuation method for determining quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the associated frequencies in open systems. We explore two exactly solvable cases based on the P\"oschl-Teller potential to show that the analytical continuation method cannot determine the full set of QNMs and frequencies of a given problem starting from the associated bound state problem in Quantum Mechanics. The root of the problem is that many QNMs are the analytically continued counterparts of solutions that do not belong to the domain where the associated Schr\"odinger operator is self-adjoint, challenging the application of the method for determining full sets of QNMs. We illustrate these problems through the physically relevant case of BTZ black holes, where the natural domain of the problem is the negative real line.</description>

      <title>Existence of Non-singular Stellar Solutions within the context of Electromagnetic Field: A Comparison between Minimal and Non-minimal Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the existence of various non-singular compact stellar solutions influenced by the Maxwell field within the matter-geometry coupling based modified gravity. We start this analysis by considering a static spherically symmetric spacetime which is associated with the isotropic matter distribution. We then determine the field equations corresponding to two specific functions of this modified theory. Along with these models, we also adopt different forms of the matter Lagrangian. We observe several unknowns in these equations such as the metric potentials, charge and fluid parameters. Thus, the embedding class-one condition and a particular realistic equation of state is used to construct their corresponding solutions. The former condition provides the metric components possessing three constants, and we calculate them through junction conditions. Further, four developed models are graphically analyzed under different parametric values. Finally, we find all our developed solutions well-agreeing with the physical requirements, offering valuable insights for future explorations of the stellar compositions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Space gravitational wave detection: Progress and outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detection is based on the astrodynamical equations derived from gravitational theory to detect changes in distance between spacecraft/celestial bodies and/or their state changes caused by gravitational waves. The fundamental method involves using electromagnetic waves (including radio waves, microwaves, light waves, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.) for Doppler tracking and comparing to the stable frequency standards (sources) at both the transmitting and receiving ends. Examples include microwave Doppler tracking, optical clock gravitational wave detection, atom interferometry gravitational wave detection, and laser interferometry gravitational wave detection. If the frequency sources at both ends are not sufficiently stable, a generalized dual-path Michelson interferometer based on Doppler tracking combinations is needed. Currently, the main space-based gravitational wave detectors under construction or planning are laser interferometers, which cover medium frequency (0.1-10 Hz) and low-frequency (millihertz 0.1-100 mHz and microhertz 0.1-100 {\mu}Hz) gravitational wave detection bands. This article reviews the current status and prospects of these gravitational wave detection methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave ringdown analysis using the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the final stage of the merger of two black holes, the ringdown signal takes an important role on providing information about the gravitational dynamics in strong field. We introduce a novel time-domain (TD) approach, predicated on the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, for ringdown analysis. This method diverges from traditional TD techniques in that its parameter space remains constant irrespective of the number of modes incorporated. This feature is achieved by reconfiguring the likelihood and analytically maximizing over the extrinsic parameters that encompass the amplitudes and reference phases of all modes. Consequently, when performing the ringdown analysis under the assumption that the ringdown signal is detected by the Einstein Telescope, parameter estimation computation time is shortened by at most five orders of magnitude compared to the traditional TD method. We further establish that traditional TD methods become difficult when including multiple overtone modes due to close oscillation frequencies and damping times across different overtone modes. Encouragingly, this issue is effectively addressed by our new TD technique. The accessibility of this new TD method extends to a broad spectrum of research and offers flexibility for various topics within black hole spectroscopy applicable to both current and future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Different aspects of entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short review of the recent developments of entropic cosmology based on two thermodynamic laws of the apparent horizon, namely the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. The first law essentially provides the change of the entropy of the apparent horizon during the cosmic evolution of the universe, in particular, it is given by: $TdS = -d(\rho V) + W dV$ (where $W$ is the work density and other quantities have their usual meaning). In this way, the first law actually links various theories of gravity with the entropy of the apparent horizon. This leads to a natural question -- ``what will be the form of the horizon entropy corresponding to a general modified theory of gravity?'' The second law of horizon thermodynamics states that the change of total entropy (the sum of horizon entropy $+$ matter fields' entropy) with respect to cosmic time must be positive, where the matter fields behave like an open system characterised by a non-zero chemical potential. The second law of horizon thermodynamics importantly provides model-independent constraints on entropic parameters. Finally, we discuss the standpoint of entropic cosmology on inflation (or bounce), reheating and primordial gravitational waves from the perspective of generalised entropy function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities of modeling a spherically symmetric static spacetime that can emerge as the end state of gravitational collapse, by considering it to be seeded by a composite fluid made of matter and a scalar field. In this scenario, the matter represents dark matter, while the scalar field represents dark energy. On certain scales, dark energy is believed to significantly influence the structure formation of dark matter. Various models describe the possible impacts of dark energy on structure formation under different scenarios. By investigating an inhomogeneous scalar field representing dark energy, coupled with dark matter, we demonstrate that this two-component fluid can seed spacetimes forming the final equilibrium state. We derive solutions for the scalar field and potential for Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN) spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Fermion behavior around Sung-Won-Kim wormholes in a generalized Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of fermions in the vicinity of Sung-Won-Kim wormholes \cite{SW Kim PRD 1996} within the framework of a generalized Kaluza-Klein gravity. The study explores the geometric and quantum implications of introducing an extra dimension into the Sung-Won-Kim wormhole model. The impact of this additional dimension on the stability and traversability of the wormholes, as well as on the fermionic equations of motion, is analyzed. By examining the modified Dirac equation in this extended framework, the emergence of geometric phases and quantum holonomies is discussed, providing insights into the topological aspects of fermion dynamics in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation has been done for possible existence of evolving wormhole (WH) solution in the background of inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) space-time geometry. Using separable product form of the geometric (or area) radius, the shape function can be evaluated in terms of the functional part of the radial coordinate in the area radius. The conditions for a viable WH configuration have been examined.</description>

Abstract: An attempt has been made to have an analytical description for possible traversable wormhole in non-static spherically symmetric space-time supported by anisotropic fluid. Both trivial and non-trivial choices of the red-shift function result in identical WH configuration and it is possible to have emergent scenario for evolution of the background space-time in both the cases.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative quasinormal modes of Schwarzchild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r - \varphi$ and $r - t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the speed of sound on the gravitational wave power spectrum from sound waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space-based interferometers offer an unprecedented opportunity to detect signals from the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale. The phase transition is accompanied by a change of the equation of state from that of pure radiation. In this work we study the effect of this change on the power spectrum of gravitational waves generated by the sound waves in the plasma during the acoustic phase of the transition. We carry out an analytic calculation assuming that the sound speed and the fluid shear-stress that sources tensor perturbations remain approximately constant during the acoustic phase. The effect of a softer equation of state is twofold: (i) a scale-independent suppression of the power spectrum at all scales, due to the modified propagation of both sound and gravitational waves and (ii) the peak of the spectrum moves to smaller frequencies as the equation of state becomes softer. The power-law indices of the spectrum at small and large scales are unaffected by the softening of the equation of state. Our work improves the current estimation of the gravitational waves power spectrum from first order phase transitions and expands the possible scenarios of transitions that can be tested by gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A new framework for cosmological expansion in a reformulated Newtonian-Like gravity with variable G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01468v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Newtonian-like theory inspired by the Brans-Dicke gravitational Lagrangian has been recently proposed in Ref. arXiv:2009.04434(v4). We propose here a new variant of this theory such that the usual Newtonian second law is preserved. The cosmological solutions are analysed and accelerated cosmic expansion can be obtained in pure matter dominated universes. This happens due to the dynamical gravitational coupling of the introduced time varying field. We also analyse the matter density perturbations and find they exhibit an enhanced growth in comparison with the usual Newtonian like behavior in Einstein-de Sitter model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a numerical code, based on the collocation or pseudospectal method, which integrates the equations of the BSSN formalism in cylindrical coordinates. In order to validate the code, we carried out a series of tests, using three groups of initial data: i) pure gauge evolution; ii) Teukolsky quadrupole solution for low amplitudes and iii) Brill and Teukolsky solutions with higher amplitudes, which accounts for a deviation from the linear regime when compared to the case of low amplitudes. In practically all cases, violations of the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints were analyzed. We also analyze the behavior of the lapse function, which can characterize the collapse of gravitational waves into black holes. Furthermore, all three groups of tests used different computational mesh resolutions and different gauge choices, thus providing a general scan of most of the numerical solutions adopted.</description>

      <title>Investigating early and late-time epochs in $ f(Q) $ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following work, a new hybrid model of the form $ f(Q)=Q(1+a)+b\frac{Q_0^2}{Q} $ has been proposed and confronted using both early as well as late-time constraints. We first use conditions from the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in order to constrain the models which are further used to study the evolution of the Universe through the deceleration parameter. This methodology is employed for the hybrid model as well as a simple model of the form $ \alpha_1 Q+\alpha_2 Q_0 $ which is found to reduce to $\Lambda$CDM. The error bar plot for the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets which includes the comparison with $\Lambda$CDM, has been studied for the constrained hybrid model. Additionally, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of the model against three datasets -- CC, Pantheon+SH0ES, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to find the best-fit ranges of the free parameters. It is found that the constraint range of the model parameter ($a$) from the BBN study has a region of overlap with the ranges obtained from the MCMC analysis. Finally, we perform a statistical comparison between our model and the $\Lambda$CDM model using AIC and BIC method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background due to core collapse resulting in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic background of gravitational wave signals arising from the core-collapse supernovae is produced through various complex mechanisms that need detailed and careful investigation. We proposed a simplified multi-peak waveform of the amplitude spectrum. The corresponding energy spectra of our model fit the energy spectra obtained from different numerical simulations of various types of core-collapse events such as non-rotating, slow and fast rotating massive progenitors resulting in neutron stars. The maximum dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{gw}$ corresponding to our model is of $\mathcal{O}(10 {^{-12})} $ around 650 Hz. Assuming some degree of uncertainty, we estimated the parameters for the core collapse waveform using BILBY. We studied the detectability of the signal of our model against gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope, advanced LIGO and Virgo. Our study indicates that these detectors have to gain more sensitivity to pick up the gravitational wave signals of stochastic background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two models of quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-like black holes were developed within Effective Quantum Gravity, and the spectra of bosonic perturbations have been analyzed in several recent studies. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of massless Dirac field perturbations around these black holes. By employing the higher-order WKB method and time-domain integration, we achieved consistency between the two approaches within their common range of validity. This concordance enables us to distinguish the two quantum-corrected black hole models from each other and from their Schwarzschild limit through their quasinormal spectra.</description>

      <title>Observing Black Hole Phase Transitions in Extended Phase Space and Holographic Thermodynamics Approaches from Optical Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transitions of charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes are characterized by studying null geodesics in the vicinity of the critical curve of photon trajectories around black holes as well as their optical appearance as the black hole images. In the present work, the critical parameters including the orbital half-period $\tau$, the angular Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$, and the temporal Lyapunov exponent $\gamma_L$ are employed to characterize black hole phase transitions within both the extended phase space and holographic thermodynamics frameworks. Under certain conditions, we observe multi-valued function behaviors of these parameters as functions of bulk pressure and temperature in the respective approaches. We propose that $\tau$, $\lambda_L$, and $\gamma_L$ can serve as order parameters due to their discontinuous changes at first-order phase transitions. To validate this, we provide detailed analytical calculations demonstrating that these optical critical parameters follow scaling behavior near the critical phase transition point. Notably, the critical exponents for these parameters are found to be $1/2$, consistent with those of the van der Waals fluid. Our findings suggest that static and distant observers can study black hole thermodynamics by analyzing the images of regions around the black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz transformation equations provide us a set of relations between the spacetime co-ordinates as observed from two different inertial frames. In case, one of the frames is moving with a uniform rectilinear we have Rindlers transformation equations under such a situation. In the present work we extend the Rindlers equations to a situation where we have in general non-uniform acceleration. First we consider the non-inertial frame to undergo simple harmonic motion (SHM) and as a second case we consider the non-inertial frame to move uniformly along a circle. This set of transformation equations will have applications in various branches of Physics and in general in Astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Towards a group structure for superluminal velocity boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical subluminal Lorentz boosts have a clear geometric interpretation. They can be neatly expressed as hyperbolic rotations, that leave both the family of $2$-sheet hyperboloids within the light cone, and the family $1$-sheet hyperboloids exterior to it, invariant. In this work, we construct a map between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding operators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot `jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least not classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself, generate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are discussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in $(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different way. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to existing models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts within a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology, that contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set containing both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results to higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Observational features of deformed Schwarzschild black holes illuminated by an anisotropic accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projection effect of an anisotropic accretion disk causes its electromagnetic radiation to depend on the emission angle. Although this dependency has the potential to influence the observational characteristics of black holes, it has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we employ a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm to numerically simulate 86 GHz and 230 GHz images of deformed Schwarzschild black holes illuminated by an equatorial anisotropic accretion disk, aiming to reveal the observational signatures of the target black hole and the impact of the projection effect on the images. The study demonstrates that while the introduction of the projection effect does not alter the profiles of the black hole's inner shadow and critical curve, it significantly suppresses the specific intensity of light rays, particularly in direct emission, thereby reducing image brightness. The extent of this reduction depends on both the observation inclination and frequency. This phenomenon aids in the extraction of geometric information from higher-order subrings in the image. Furthermore, we find that increasing the deformation parameter enhances the brightness of the deformed Schwarzschild black hole image, accompanied by a reduction in the size of the critical curve and inner shadow. This relationship establishes a connection between the intrinsic properties of deformed Schwarzschild black holes and their observational characteristics, providing a reliable tool for testing the no-hair theorem and gravitational theories. Specifically, we propose a novel method for constraining parameters based on the silhouette of the inner shadow, which holds promise for extension to any spherically symmetric black hole in other gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: We study supertranslations at spatial and future timelike infinity in the first-order formalism. We relax the Ashtekar-Engle-Sloan boundary conditions to allow supertranslations at the spatial infinity and obtain the precise form of the tetrads and Lorentz connections. Employing the covariant phase space technique we obtain the Hamiltonian charges for the supertranslations at both timelike and spatial infinities. The charges obtained are shown to match the expressions reported adopting the metric-based approach.</description>

      <title>Merging cosmologically coupled black holes: stochastic gravitational wave background and implications for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. We examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by merging supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, the enhancement factor can exceed an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from binary BH mergers, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic interpretation of the Stephani Universes is studied in detail. The general expression of the speed of sound and of the thermodynamic schemes associated with a thermodynamic solution is obtained. The constraints imposed on the solutions by considering some significant physical properties are analyzed. We focus on the models where the cosmological observer measures isotropic radiation. We consider some examples, and a solution that models an ultrarelativistic gas is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this article, I will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>

Abstract: This review is an up-to-date account of the use of numerical relativity to study dynamical, strong-gravity environments in a cosmological context. First, we provide a gentle introduction into the use of numerical relativity in solving cosmological spacetimes, aimed at both cosmologists and numerical relativists. Second, we survey the present body of work, focusing on general relativistic simulations without approximations, organised according to the cosmological history -- from cosmogenesis, through the early hot Big Bang, to the late-time evolution of universe. In both cases, we discuss the present state-of-the-art, and suggest directions in which future work can be fruitfully pursued.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of gravitational wave astronomy began in 2015 with the observation of the signal from the merger of two black holes by the LIGO detectors; by 2021, almost 100 more such transient signals from coalescences of compact binaries of black holes and neutron stars were catalogued. With improvements to the ground-based interferometer network consisting of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA now promising to bring the total number of detections into the hundreds, we review the observational signatures and analysis methods for the most prolific gravitational-wave source: the coalescence of compact binaries.</description>

      <title>Cosmic averaging over multiscaled structure: on foliations, gauges and backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation that accelerated cosmic expansion is dominant since the Mega-parsec cosmic structure became nonlinear seems like an extraordinary coincidence, unless the acceleration is somehow driven by the emergence of the structure. That has given rise to the controversial concept of a gravitational backreaction through which inhomogeneity becomes a driver of accelerated expansion. The standard route when studying strongly inhomogeneous cosmological models is to take either a perturbative approach or a spatial averaging approach. Here we argue that because backreaction is in fact a nonlinear multiscale phenomenon, perturbative approaches may have a limited validity. The alternative is the proposed averaging approach. In this paper we demonstrate that the implied backreaction terms are artificial, that is gauge dependent, which may easily cause ambiguous estimates of its significance. In the current study, we forward a formal fully geometric framework of cosmic foliations in the context of relativistic cosmology. Here we show that fixing a foliation of spacetime determines a choice of gauge. Addressing the correspondence between the metric tensor and the foliation allows us to clarify the theoretical implications of choosing a foliation. Within the context of backreaction, this formalism allows us to discuss the complications of averaging. It reveals that spatial averaging can induce artificial backreaction terms that arise from any specific choice of gauge. Averaging methods presented so far all encounter this problem. Within our foliation framework, we can produce a gauge invariant method of averaging by considering a group of proper time foliations which any cosmic observe can agree upon. We demonstrate that this implies the gauge invariance of the averaging procedure. This makes it applicable to standard cosmological simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearised gravity has a global symmetry under which the graviton is shifted by a symmetric tensor satisfying a certain flatness condition. There is also a dual symmetry that can be associated with a global shift symmetry of the dual graviton theory. The corresponding conserved charges are shown to satisfy a centrally-extended algebra. We discuss the gauging of these global symmetries, finding an obstruction to the simultaneous gauging of both symmetries which we interpret as a mixed 't Hooft anomaly for the ungauged theory. We discuss the implications of this, analogous to those resulting from a similar structure in Maxwell theory, and interpret the graviton and dual graviton as Nambu-Goldstone modes for these shift symmetries.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the $SO(9) \rightarrow SO(3) \times SO(6)$ Symmetry Breaking in the IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism which explains why in the supersymmetric IKKT matrix model the $SO(9)$ symmetry of the Lagrangian is spontaneously broken to $SO(3) \times SO(6)$, allowing only three large classical spatial dimensions to emerge. The argument relies on the identification of D1-strings as stable excitations of the matrices about the cosmological background, and the absence of forces between parallel D1-string excitations. A spatial dimension can only become large if the D1-strings winding that direction can annihilate. In the absence of forces, this requires the string world sheets to intersect, a process which is highly suppressed if more than three dimensions of space are large. Implications for a recently proposed matrix cosmology scenario are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The total number of gravitons emitted during nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes or other effectively point masses is calculated approximately and found to be remarkably close to (well within 1% of, perhaps within about 0.2% of) the initial orbital angular momentum divided by the spin angular momentum of each graviton ($2\hbar$), although at unit initial eccentricity, $2\hbar$ times the initial graviton number emission per angular momentum emission is $248/(45\sqrt{3}\pi) \approx 1.012\,811\,600\,479$, almost 1.3% greater than unity.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons in Lovelock black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of space-like singularities, general relativity predicts that the metric behaves, at each point, as a Kasner space which undergoes a series of "Kasner epochs" and "eras" characterized by certain transition rules. The period during which this process takes place defines a "Kasner eon", which comes to an end when higher-curvature or quantum effects become relevant. When higher-curvature densities are included in the action, spacetime can undergo transitions into additional Kasner eons. During each eon, the metric behaves locally as a Kasner solution to the higher-curvature density controlling the dynamics. In this paper we identify the presence of Kasner eons in the interior of static and spherically symmetric Lovelock gravity black holes. We determine the conditions under which eons occur and study the Kasner metrics which characterize them, as well as the transitions between them. We show that the null energy condition implies a monotonicity property for the effective Kasner exponent at the end of the Einsteinian eon. We also characterize the Kasner solutions of more general higher-curvature theories of gravity. In particular, we observe that the Einstein gravity condition that the sum of the Kasner exponents adds up to one, $\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=1$, admits a universal generalization in the form of a family of Kasner metrics satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^{D-1}p_i=2n -1$ which exists for any order-$n$ higher-curvature density and in general dimensions.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important current problem regarding the characterization of the central engine of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consists in determining the parameters of the black holes (BHs) hosted at their cores, especially their mass. Therefore, we aim to apply a full general relativistic method to estimate the parameters of the central supermassive BHs hosted at the center of the IC 2560 and UGC 3193 galaxies. In order to achieve this aim we implement a general relativistic BH rotation curves' method and estimate the BH parameters by fitting megamaser astrophysical data available in the literature with the help of a Bayesian statistical method. We calculate the mass of the aforementioned BHs, their positions on the sky as well as the recession velocities of the host galaxies. On the basis of our estimations, we compute for the first time the BH mass of the UGC 3193 AGN. We also calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to these BHs, a general relativistic effect produced by the curvature of spacetime that has no Newtonian analogue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have reported a compelling evidence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. However, the origin of the signal remains undetermined, largely because its spectrum is bluer for an astrophysical source and can be explained by cosmological models. In this letter, we derive theoretically accurate expressions for the Fourier bin variances and correlation of pulsar timing residuals, and demonstrate their outstanding agreement with astrophysical simulations. In contrast, we show that a common power law traditionally used to interpret a stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum is generally faced with systematic errors, one of which is the illusion of a bluer signal. This hints at a conservative solution, supportive of an astrophysical source, to the observed correlated common spectrum process in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-relativistic Hietarinta supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the non-relativistic regime of the Hietarinta gravity theory and its extension to supergravity. At the bosonic level, we derive the non-relativistic version of the Hietarinta model by employing a contraction process and addressing the non-degeneracy of the invariant metric. To incorporate supersymmetry, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to obtain the non-relativistic formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Hietarinta supergravity. Our results reveal that the non-relativistic Hietarinta theory encompasses the extended Bargmann (super)gravity as a special case, yet it differs significantly from other existing non-relativistic (super)gravity models. Furthermore, we generalize our analysis to include a cosmological constant term in the non-relativistic Hietarinta (super)gravity action and examine its effects on the torsion structure.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Test of Quantum Gravity via Angular Momentum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction governed by the Newtonian potential. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering a tree-level relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2408.10799) that solar system ephemeris data can exclude primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the mass range $10^{18}$-$10^{22}\,$g. We show that this conclusion is based on an implausible, implicit assumption; namely the uncertainty on the solar system mass within 50 au is as small as the uncertainty on the mass of the sun. Correcting for this error, we find that ephemeris data can only constrain PBH's with mass below $10^{16}\,$g, which is already excluded by constraints on their evaporation via Hawking radiation. Correcting a further error concerning the time-averaged rate of such fluctuations nullifies even this weaker constraint.</description>

      <title>Spectral Representation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions are significantly more complex than their flat-space analogues, such as tree-level scattering amplitudes. While these amplitudes have simple analytic structure and clear factorisation properties, cosmological correlators often feature branch cuts and lack neat expressions. In this paper, we develop off-shell perturbative methods to study and compute cosmological correlators. We show that such approach not only makes the origin of the correlator singularity structure and factorisation manifest, but also renders practical analytical computations more tractable. Using a spectral representation of massive cosmological propagators that encodes particle production through a suitable $i\epsilon$ prescription, we remove the need to ever perform nested time integrals as they only appear in a factorised form. This approach explicitly shows that complex correlators are constructed by gluing lower-point off-shell correlators, while performing the spectral integral sets the exchanged particles on shell. Notably, in the complex mass plane instead of energy, computing spectral integrals amounts to collecting towers of poles as the simple building blocks are meromorphic functions. We demonstrate this by deriving a new, simple, and partially resummed representation for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars mediated by tree-level massive scalar exchange in de Sitter. Additionally, we establish cosmological largest-time equations that relate different channels on in-in branches via analytic continuation, analogous to crossing symmetry in flat space. These universal relations provide simple consistency checks and suggest that dispersive methods hold promise for developing cosmological recursion relations, further connecting techniques from modern scattering amplitudes to cosmology.</description>

Abstract: To consider the inevitable cosmic magnetic effects instead of the unknown dark sector of matter/energy on the inflation phase of the expanding universe some authors have proposed several extended exotic Einstein-Maxwell gravities which are addressed in this work. Some of these exotic models include directional interaction terms between the electromagnetic vector field and the metric tensor field. We use one of them to investigate the physical effects of interaction terms on the thermodynamic behavior of the modified Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole. We use the perturbation series method to find analytic solutions of the field equations because of the non-linearity of the field equations which cause they do not have analytic closed form solutions. We investigate possibility of the Hawking-Page and the small/large black hole phase transition and also, effects of the interaction part of the model on possibility of the coexistence of the several phases of the perturbed AdS RN black hole under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vigneron [Foundations of Physics, 54, 15, (2024)] recently proposed a modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical term related to the spatial topology is introduced in the Einstein equation. The original motivation for this theory is to allow for the non-relativistic limit to exist in any physical topology. In the present paper, we derive a first inhomogeneous exact vacuum solution of this theory for a spherical topology, assuming staticity and spherical symmetry. The metric represents a black hole and a repulsive singularity at opposite poles of a 3-sphere. The solution is similar to the Schwarzschild metric, but the spacelike infinity is cut, and replaced by a repulsive singularity at finite distance, implying that the spacelike hypersurfaces have finite volume, and the total mass is zero. We discuss how this solution paves the way to massive, non-static solutions of this theory, more directly relevant for cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing the black holes in a dark matter halo of M87 using gravitational wave echoes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variations at the event horizon structure of a black hole will emit the signals of the gravitational wave echoes associated with the ringdown of the binary black hole merger. In this work, combining mass model of M87 and Einasto profile for dark matter halo, we construct one formal solution of black holes in dark matter halo, and this solution includes the regular black hole for geometric parameter $a &lt; 2M$ and the wormhole for $a \geq 2M$. Then, we test this solution under axial gravitational perturbation and calculate their quasinormal modes (QNM). Our results show that when geometric parameter $a&gt;2M$, a series of gravitational wave echoes appear after the QNM, and one distinctive feature of gravitational wave echoes is the double barrier. Besides, we also study the impacts of shape parameters $\alpha$ of Einasto profile both on the QNM and gravitational wave echoes, and extract their frequencies using WKB method and Prony method. In principle, with the increasing of shape parameter $\alpha$, the frequencies of the QNM and gravitational wave echoes between the different shape parameters must be different. But now there is zero difference of the frequencies between shape parameter $\alpha=0.18$ and $\alpha=0.20$. Zero difference is not allowed, so we give an upper limit for shape parameter $\alpha$, which is approximately $\alpha&lt;0.18$. These signals of gravitational wave echoes in a dark matter halo may be detected in the near future, and these characteristics of gravitational wave echoes may serve as local measurements of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Impact of higher harmonics of gravitational radiation on the population inference of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Templates modeling just the dominant mode of gravitational radiation are generally sufficient for the unbiased parameter inference of near-equal-mass compact binary mergers. However, neglecting the subdominant modes can bias the inference if the binary is significantly asymmetric, very massive, or has misaligned spins. In this work, we explore if neglecting these subdominant modes in the parameter estimation of non-spinning binary black hole mergers can bias the inference of their population-level properties such as mass and merger redshift distributions. Assuming the design sensitivity of advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network, we find that neglecting subdominant modes will not cause a significant bias in the population inference, although including them will provide more precise estimates. This is primarily due to the fact that asymmetric binaries are expected to be rarer in our detected sample, due to their intrinsic rareness and the observational selection effects. The increased precision in the measurement of the maximum black hole mass can help in better constraining the upper mass gap in the mass spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Riemann-Cartan geometries are geometries that admit non-zero curvature and torsion tensors. These geometries have been investigated as geometric frameworks for potential theories in physics including quantum gravity theories and have many important differences when compared to Riemannian geometries. One notable difference, is the number of symmetries for a Riemann-Cartan geometry is potentially smaller than the number of Killing vector fields for the metric. In this paper, we will review the investigation of symmetries in Riemann-Cartan geometries and the mathematical tools used to determine geometries that admit a given group of symmetries. As an illustration, we present new results by determining all static spherically symmetric and all stationary spherically symmetric Riemann-Cartan geometries. Furthermore, we have determined the subclasses of spherically symmetric Riemann-Cartan geometries that admit a seven-dimensional group of symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an explicit spin-foam amplitude for Lorentzian gravity in three dimensions, allowing for both space- and time-like boundaries. The model is based on two main requirements: that it should be structurally similar to its well-known Euclidean analog, and that geometricity should be recovered in the semiclassical regime. To this end we introduce new coherent states for space-like boundary edges, derived from the continuous series of unitary $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ representations. We show that the relevant objects in the amplitude can be written in terms of the defining representation of the group, just as so happens in the Euclidean case. We derive an expression for the semiclassical amplitude at large spins, showing it relates to the Lorentzian Regge action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that warped-product spacetimes such as spherically symmetric ones admit the Kodama vector. This vector provides a locally conserved current made by contraction of the Einstein tensor, even though there is no Killing vector. In addition, a quasilocal mass, Birkhoff's theorem and various properties are closely related to the Kodama vector. Recently, it is shown that the notion of the Kodama vector can be extended to three-dimensional axisymmetric spacetimes even if the spacetimes are not warped product. This implies that warped product may not be a necessary condition for a spacetime to admit the Kodama vector. We show properties of the Kodama vector originate from the conformal Killing-Yano 2-form. In particular, the well-known spacetimes that admit the Kodama vector have a closed conformal Killing-Yano 2-form. Furthermore, we show the Kodama vector provides local conserved currents for each order of the Lovelock tensor as well as the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $f(R)$ modified gravity theory incorporating the chameleon mechanism to address galactic dynamics. By employing the metric formalism and utilizing a conformal transformation, we simplify the field equations and describe the extra degree of freedom $f_{R}$ via a scalar field (scalaron) with chameleonic behavior. A recently proposed $f(R)$ model is analyzed to illustrate this behavior effectively. Subsequently, the rotational velocity equation including the scalaron's contribution is derived for a test particle in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Then we generate rotation curves and fit them to observational data of thirty seven galaxies using two fitting parameters, $M_0$ and $r_c$, the total mass and core radius of a galaxy respectively.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of null and timelike geodesics yield Weyl and projective connections, respectively, with compatibility in the lightlike limit giving an integrable Weyl connection. Their conclusions hold only for a 4-dim representation of the conformal connection on the null cone, and by restricting reparameterizations of timelike geodesics to yield a torsion-free, affine connection. An arbitrary connection gives greater freedom. A linear connection for the conformal symmetry of null geodesics requires the SO(4,2) representation. The enlarged class of projective transformations of timelike geodesics changes Weyl's projective curvature, and we find invariant forms of the torsion and nonmetricity, along with a new, invariant, second rank tensor field generalizing the dilatational curvature without requiring a metric. We show that either projective or conformal connections require a monotonic, twice differentiable function on a spacetime region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and gauge choices within either can reduce the geometry to the original Riemannian form. Thus, measurements of null and timelike geodesics lead to an SO(4,2) connection, with no requirement for a lightlike limit. Reduction to integrable Weyl symmetry can only follow from the field equations of a gravity theory. We show that the simplest quadratic spacetime action leads to this reduction.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the black-hole charges of M87* and Sagittarius A* by changing rates of photon spheres can be relaxed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration observed ring images called the shadows of M87* and Sagittarius~A* (Sgr~A*), which are supermassive objects in M87 and our galaxy, respectively, and their general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes imply that the observed rings are formed by the gravitational lensing of synchrotron radiations from a hot plasma near outside of supermassive black holes. The EHT Collaboration gave constrains on the electrical or alternative charges of M87* and Sgr A* under an assumption that the radius of the observed ring should be proportional to the changing rates of photon spheres by the charges. Since the validness of this assumption is not sure, it is worth to checking the same constraints under another assumption. In this paper, we consider the changing rates of not only the photon spheres but also lensing rings in a simple model and we test whether aforementioned constraint is robust. We conclude that EHT Collaboration's constraints based on the changing rates of the photon spheres can be relaxed compared to that based on the changing rate of the lensing rings while we do not claim that the observed rings are formed by the photon spheres and the lensing rings in our simple model. We concentrate on Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole spacetimes in this paper, but our result implies the relaxation of the bound of the charge parameters on other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>General Relativity from Intersection Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper combines the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity with the language of intersection theory. Because of the nature of the soft limit inherent to the post-Minkowskian expansion, the intersection-based approach is of enhanced utility in that theory compared to a generic quantum field theory. In the language of intersection theory, Feynman integrals are rephrased in terms of twisted cocycles. The intersection number is a pairing between two such cocycles and its existence allows for the direct projection onto a basis of master integrals. In this paper we use this approach to compute the second post-Minkowskian contribution to the scattering of two compact astronomical objects, getting results in agreement with previous findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a four-dimensional gravity action and explore the idea that the Einsteinian and galactic laws of gravitation should emerge as two different dynamical phases of the resulting theory. A new set of spacetime solutions exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves are found. These geometries correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. We also provide an explanation of the empirical correlation between the luminosity and the slope of the velocity curve. We find an enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is lesser than the deflection predicted for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>

      <title>Possible signatures of higher dimension in thin accretion disk around brane world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations with Timelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study static tidal Love numbers (TLNs) of a static and spherically symmetric black hole for odd-parity metric perturbations. We describe black hole perturbations using the effective field theory (EFT), formulated on an arbitrary background with a timelike scalar profile in the context of scalar-tensor theories. In particular, we obtain a static solution for the generalized Regge-Wheeler equation order by order in a modified-gravity parameter and extract the TLNs uniquely by analytic continuation of the multipole index $\ell$ to non-integer values. For a stealth Schwarzschild black hole, the TLNs are vanishing as in the case of Schwarzschild solution in general relativity. We also study the case of Hayward black hole as an example of non-stealth background, where we find that the TLNs are non-zero (or there is a logarithmic running). This result suggests that our EFT allows for non-vanishing TLNs and can in principle leave a detectable imprint on gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems, which opens a new window for testing gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we explore the experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: general experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a rotating black hole with electric and magnetic monopole charges that moves in a static homogeneous electromagnetic field. We assume that both the charges and the fields are weak, so that they have no effect on the spacetime geometry, which is described by the Kerr metric. We present exact solutions to Maxwell's equations describing the field of a charged rotating black hole moving in an external field background. We use these solutions to calculate the energy, momentum, and angular momentum fluxes of the electromagnetic field into the black hole. Using these results, we obtain expressions for the torque and force acting on the moving charged rotating black hole arising as a result of its interaction with the external electromagnetic field. We calculate these quantities both in the frame comoving with the black hole and in the frame of the external background field. We use this result to derive the equations that govern the change in the black hole's mass and spin, as well as the motion of the black hole. We provide exact solutions for specific cases which illustrate the role of charge and spin on the motion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model of gravitational self-force enhanced tides in inspiralling binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling binary neutron stars provide unique access to ultra-dense nuclear matter and offer the ability to constrain the currently unknown neutron star equation-of-state through tidal measurements. This, however, requires the availability of accurate and efficient tidal waveform models. In this paper we present PhenomGSF, a new phenomenological tidal phase model for the inspiral of neutron stars in the frequency-domain, which captures the gravitational self-force informed tidal contributions of the time-domain effective-one-body model TEOBResumS. PhenomGSF is highly faithful and computationally efficient, and by choosing a modular approach, it can be used in conjunction with any frequency-domain binary black hole waveform model to generate the complete phase for a binary neutron star inspiral. PhenomGSF is valid for neutron star binaries with unequal masses and mass ratios between 1 and 3, and dimensionless tidal deformabilities up to 5000. Furthermore, PhenomGSF does not assume universal relations or parameterised equations-of-state, hence allowing for exotic matter analyses and beyond standard model physics investigations. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of our model through comparisons against TEOBResumS, numerical relativity waveforms and full Bayesian inference, including a reanalysis of the binary neutron star observation GW170817.</description>

      <title>A better space of generalized connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a base manifold $M$ and a Lie group $G$, we define $\bar{\cal A}^H_M$ a space of generalized $G$-connections on $M$ with the following properties:
  - The space of smooth connections ${\cal A}^\infty_M = \sqcup_\pi {\cal A}^\infty_\pi$ is densely embedded in $\bar{\cal A}^H_M = \sqcup_\pi \bar{\cal A}^H_{cc(\pi)}$; moreover, in contrast with the usual space of generalized connections, the embedding preserves topological sectors.
  - It is a homogeneous covering space for the standard space of generalized connections of loop quantization $\bar{\cal A}_M$.
  - It is a measurable space constructed as an inverse limit of of spaces of connections with a cutoff, much like $\bar{\cal A}_M$. At each level of the cutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.
  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q= \int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \int Tr(F \wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.
  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of generalized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary connections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.
  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy parallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard generalized connections by forgetting its higher levels.
  - The kth level of our higher gauge fields is trivial if and only if $\pi_{k-1} G$ is trivial. Then $\bar{\cal A}^H_\Sigma \neq \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$ if the gauge group is not simply connected and $d \geq 2$. For $G=SL(2, {\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$ and $\dim \Sigma = 3$, however, we get $\bar{\cal A}^H_\Sigma = \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$: Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is consistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for quantum gravity would be sensitive to homotopy data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical appearance of the numerically black hole solutions within the higher derivative gravity illuminated by an accretion disk context is discussed. We obtain solutions for non-Schwarzschild black holes with r0 = 1, r0 = 2, and r0 = 3. Further analysis of spacetime trajectories reveals properties similar to Schwarzschild black holes, while the r0 = 2 black hole exhibits significant differences. The results reveal the presence of a repulsive potential barrier for the black hole, allowing only particles with energies exceeding a certain threshold to approach it, providing a unique gravitational scenario for non-Schwarzschild black holes. Additionally, the optical images are derived through numerical simulations by discussing the trajectories of photons intheblackholespacetime.The distribution of radiation flux and the effects of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift on the observed radiation flux are considered. Interestingly, previous analyses of the optical appearance of black holes were conducted within the framework of analytic solutions, whereas the analysis of numerical black hole solutions first appears in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational odd-parity perturbation of a Horndeski hairy black hole: quasinormal mode and parameter constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the binary black hole coalescence, the gravitational wave emitted at the ringdown stage can be well described within the black hole perturbation theory, where the quasinormal modes (QNMs) become the important ingredient in modeling the pattern wave form. In general ralativity (GR), the QNMs can be obtained from solving the Regge-Wheeler equation in static black hole, while in Horndeski gravity, the metric perturbation equation can be simplified into a modified Regge-Wheeler equation from the perturbed action. In this paper, we calculate the QNMs frequencies of the gravitational odd-parity perturbation of a specific hairy black hole in Horndeski gravity with the use of the matrix method and pseudo spectral method. Our results indicate that such a Horndeski hairy black hole is stable under the odd perturbation, which is also verified by the time evolution of the perturbation. In particular, we find that for a certain range of the Horndeski hair, the $\ell&gt;2$ modes become the long-lived mode instead of $\ell=2$ mode in GR. Then, we use the ringdown QNMs to preliminarily investigate the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) rescaled measurement error of the Horndeski hair. We obtained significant effects of the angular momentum and overtone on the error bound of the hairy parameter. We hope that our findings could inspire more theoretical and phenomenal work on the test of no-hair theorem of black hole from gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>The quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of Proca fields in quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of a massive vector field around a quantum corrected black hole in de-Sitter spacetime. We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads to get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal framework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric instability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and Proca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs' migration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with arbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through pseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of the time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages in time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late time tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by quantum correction is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of neutrinos in the Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gravitational lensing of neutrinos in the Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime in the weak-field limit with plane-wave approximation. We apply the analysis to an hypothetical system with a central object with its mass of the order of solar mass and a detector located at an Earth-like distance from the source. We find that the deformation parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric can have significant impact on the oscillation probabilities of the neutrinos. We also investigate the role of decoherence on flavor oscillations of the lensed neutrinos and show that the parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric does not have significant effects on the decoherence length.</description>

      <title>Deep Einstein@Home search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 using LIGO public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3 using LIGO O2 and O3 public data. Over $10^{18}$ different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20-1300 Hz (20-400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavour possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multi-stage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The selection threshold is set so that a signal could be confirmed using the first half of the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals, corresponding to deformations below $10^{-6}$ in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near $161$ Hz, we set 90\%\ confidence upper limits on the gravitational wave intrinsic amplitude of $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.2\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near $163$ Hz, we set $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.4\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of \cite{ligo_o3a_c_v} but they apply to a broader set of signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models -- developed to approach spacetime quantization -- can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many future of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Time from Unitary Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of unitary equivalence $\hat{H}\sim\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}\hat{U}$ between the modular Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\mathrm{mod}}$ and the subsystem Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the context of realizing the emergence of time through a unitary operator $\hat{U}$. This concept suggests a duality between the modular flow and time evolution. Additionally, requiring unitary equivalence implies a connection between the "Modular Chaos Bound" and the "Chaos Bound". Furthermore, we demonstrate this duality using quantum chaos diagnostic quantities in the thermofield double state of a fermionic system. Quantum chaos diagnostic quantities are mathematical measures that characterize chaotic behavior in quantum systems. By examining these quantities in the thermofield double state, we illustrate the duality between them and the modular Hamiltonian. We show a specific duality between correlators, the spectral form factor, and the Loschmidt echo with the modular Hamiltonian. The spectral form factor is a quantity that provides information about the energy spectrum of a quantum system, while the Loschmidt echo characterizes the sensitivity of a system's modular time evolution to perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that a different entanglement spectrum does not impose the same constraint on the subsystem Hamiltonian. The entanglement spectrum is related to entanglement entropy and provides information about the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix associated with a subsystem. We discuss complex concepts related to the interplay between quantum chaos, time emergence, and the relationship between modular and subsystem Hamiltonians. These ideas are part of ongoing research in quantum information theory and related fields.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microphysical bulk viscosity in binary neutron star post-merger dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nuclear matter in isolated neutron stars, the flavor content (e.g., proton fraction) is subject to weak interactions, establishing flavor ($\beta$-)equilibrium. However, there can be deviations from this equilibrium during the merger of two neutron stars. We study the resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the collision by incorporating direct and modified Urca processes (in the neutrino-transparent regime) into general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with a simplified neutrino transport scheme. We demonstrate how weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in post-merger simulations can emerge and assess the bulk viscous dynamics of the resulting flow. We further place limits on the impact on the post-merger gravitational wave strain. Our results show that weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity can potentially lead to a phase shift of the post-merger gravitational wave spectrum, although the effect is currently on the same level as the numerical errors of our simulation.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Network: A Dual Solution for Gravitational Waves and Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that domain wall networks generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) observed as a strong common power-law process in the Data Release-2 of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find that a broad range of parameters, specifically wall tension around $\sigma_{\textrm{DW}} \sim (29-414 , \textrm{TeV})^3$ and wall-decay temperature within $T_d \sim 20-257 , \textrm{MeV}$, can explain this phenomenon at a $68\%$ credible level. Meanwhile, the same parameters could ease the Hubble tension if particles from these domain wall networks decay into dark radiation. We establish a direct analytical relationship, $\Omega_{\textrm{GW}}(f_p,T_0) h^2 \sim \Omega_{\textrm{rad}} h^2 ( \Omega_\nu \Delta N_{\textrm{eff}})^2$, to illustrate this coincidence, underlining its importance in the underlying physics and potential applicability to a wider range of models and data. Conversely, if the common power-law process is not attributed to domain wall networks, our findings impose tight limits on the wall tension and decay temperature.</description>

      <title>Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms and the generalized geometrical trinity of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) as described in terms of curvature by the Einstein-Hilbert action is dynamically equivalent to theories of gravity formulated in terms of spacetime torsion or non-metricity. This forms what is called the geometrical trinity of gravity. The theories corresponding to this trinity are, apart from GR, the teleparallel (TEGR) and symmetric teleparallel (STEGR) equivalent theories of general relativity, respectively, and their actions are equivalent to GR up to boundary terms $B$. We investigate how the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term of GR changes under the transition to TEGR and STEGR within the framework of metric-affine gravity. We show that $B$ is the difference between the GHY term of GR and that of metric-affine gravity. Moreover, we show that the GHY term for both TEGR and STEGR must vanish for consistency of the variational problem. Furthermore, our approach allows to extend the equivalence between GR, TEGR and STEGR beyond the Einstein-Hilbert action to any action built out of the curvature two-form, thus establishing the generalized geometrical trinity of gravity. We argue that these results will be particularly useful in view of studying gauge/gravity duality for theories with torsion and non-metricity.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Representation Theory: Setting the Scope of the ISE Method of Topological Redescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime dualities arise whenever two theories -- despite being structurally equivalent in some sense -- seemingly provide us with two radically different spatiotemporal descriptions of the world. This often involves radical differences in how the two theories topologically stage their states; Whereas one theory is about *this* type of particle/field on *this* smooth manifold, the other theory is about *that* type of particle/field arranged differently on *that* smooth manifold. For instance, the AdS-CFT correspondence relates a certain theory set in the bulk (our 3+1 dimensional spacetime) to another theory set on the boundary (a 2+1 dimensional spacetime). Another example (new in this paper) is the M\"{o}bius-Euclid duality: a theory about a certain type of particle floating around on the Euclidean plane can be topologically redescribed as instead being about a different type of particle living on a M\"{o}bius strip, and vice versa.
  The possibility of such alternative spacetime framings raises some significant questions about the epistemology and metaphysics of space and time. For instance, what are our topology selection criteria? Are they objective or conventional? Moreover, given that two spacetime theories are topological redescriptions of each other, what is the common core which they are equivalent descriptions of? As a step towards answering such questions, this paper develops a general framework (spacetime representation theory) for understanding our ability to topologically redescribe our spacetime theories. With this framework established, I will then discuss the ISE Equivalence Theorem which sets the scope of the recently developed ISE Method of topological redescription.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, reference frames must be distinguished from coordinates. The former represent physical systems interacting with the gravitational system, aside from possible approximations, while the latter are mathematical artefacts. We propose a novel three-fold distinction between Idealised Reference Frames, Dynamical Reference Frames and Real Reference Frames. In doing so, the paper not only clarifies the physical significance of reference frames, but also sheds light on the similarities between idealised reference frames and coordinates. It also analyses the salience of reference frames to define local Dirac observables and to propose a physical interpretation to diffeomorphism gauge symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the metric is chosen to depend exponentially on the conformal factor, and if one works in a gauge where the conformal factor has the wrong sign propagator, perturbative quantum gravity corrections can be partially resummed into a series of terms each of which is ultraviolet finite. These new terms however are not perturbative in some small parameter, and are not individually BRST invariant, or background diffeomorphism invariant. With appropriate parametrisation, the finiteness property holds true also for a full phenomenologically relevant theory of quantum gravity coupled to (beyond the standard model) matter fields, provided massive tadpole corrections are set to zero by a trivial renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic condensate and energy-momentum tensor in cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we analyze the expectation value of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor associated with a massive charged fermionic quantum field with a nonzero chemical potential propagating in a magnetic-flux-carrying cosmic string in thermal equilibrium at finite temperature $T$. The expectation values of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor are expressed as the sum of vacuum expectation values and the finite temperature contributions coming from the particles and antiparticles excitation. The thermal expectations values of the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor are even periodic functions of the magnetic flux with period being the quantum flux, and also even functions of the chemical potential. Because the analyses of vacuum expectation of the fermionic condensate and energy-momentum tensor have been developed in literature, here we are mainly interested in the investigation of the thermal corrections. In this way we explicitly study how these observable behaves in the limits of low and high temperatures, and also for points near the string. Besides the analytical discussions, we included some graphs that exhibit the behavior of these observable for different values of the physical parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the generic solution of the Newman-Penrose equations in the Newman-Unti gauge with vanishing curvature tensor. The obtained solutions are the vacua of the gravitational theory which are connected to the derivations in metric formalism from exponentiating the infinitesimal BMS generators in the BMS gauge in \cite{Compere:2016jwb,Compere:2016hzt} by a radial transformation. The coordinate transformations in the Newman-Unti gauge connecting each vacuum are also obtained. We confirm that the supertranslation charge of the gravitational vacua with respect to global considerations vanishes exactly not only in the Einstein theory but also when including the Holst, Pontryagin, and Gauss-Bonnet terms which verifies that the gravitational vacua are not affected by those trivial or boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Multifield curved solid: Early dark energy and perturbation instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multifield dark energy model with a nonflat field-space metric, in which one field is dynamical while the others have constant spatial gradients. The model is predictive at the background level, leading to an early dark energy component at high redshifts and a suppressed fraction of late-time anisotropy. Both features have simple expressions in terms of the curvature scale of the field-space, and correspond to stable points in the phase space of possible solutions. Because of the coupling between time and space-dependent scalar fields, vector field perturbations develop tachyonic instabilities at scales below the Hubble radius, thus being potentially observable in the number count of galaxies. Overall, the presence of a nontrivial field-space curvature also leads to the appearance of instabilities on scalar perturbations, which can impact the matter density distribution at large scales.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Inclusion of PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars (NSs), while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic version of the model that does not include hyperons or a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of NS properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.1$ km radius in the posterior of the NS mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Perturbation of Hairy Black Holes in EsGB theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar field perturbations of the hairy black holes involved with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global U(1) symmetry in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory for asymptotically flat spacetimes. We consider the mechanism that black holes without hairs become unstable at the critical point of the coupling constant and undergo a phase transition to hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This transition occurs near the black hole horizon due to the diminishing influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term at infinity. To examine such process, we introduce a scalar field perturbation on the newly formed background spacetime. We solve the linearized perturbation equation using Green's function method. We begin by solving the Green's function, incorporating the branch cut contribution. This allows us to analytically investigate the late-time behavior of the perturbation at both spatial and null infinity. We found that the late-time behavior only differs from the Schwarzschild black hole by a mass term. We then proceed to calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) numerically, which arise from the presence of poles in the Green's function. Our primary interest lies in utilizing QNMs to investigate the stability of the black hole solutions both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases. Consistent with the prior study, our analysis shows that hairy black holes in the symmetric phase become unstable when the quadratic coupling constant exceeds a critical value for a fixed value of the quartic coupling constant. In contrast, hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase are always stable at the critical value. These numerical results provide strong evidence for a dynamical process that unstable black holes without hairs transition into stable hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase through the spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linearized gravity theory in the Newman-Unti gauge in the near horizon region of the de Sitter spacetime. The linearized Einstein equation involves the cosmological constant. The near horizon symmetry consists of near horizon supertranslation and near horizon superrotation. We compute the near horizon supertranslation charge and find the proper near horizon fall-off conditions which uncover a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon supertranslation.</description>

      <title>Classifying post-Minkowskian geometries for gravitational waves via loop-by-loop Baikov</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the loop-by-loop Baikov representation to investigate the geometries in Feynman integrals contributing to the classical dynamics of a black-hole two-body system in the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity. These geometries determine the spaces of functions to which the corresponding Feynman diagrams evaluate. As a proof of principle, we provide a full classification of the geometries appearing up to three loops, i.e. fourth post-Minkowskian order, for all diagrams relevant to the conservative as well as the dissipative dynamics, finding full agreement with the literature. Moreover, we show that the non-planar top topology at four loops, which is the most complicated sector with respect to integration-by-parts identities, has an algebraic leading singularity and thus can only depend on non-trivial geometries through its subsectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Strong-field QED effects on polarization states in dipole and quadrudipole pulsar emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of $k$-essence Model: Dynamical System Analysis and Observational Constraints from Latest Type Ia Supernova and BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the AdS/CFT correspondence framework, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Kasner interiors from analytic hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct an exhaustive study of the interior geometry of a family of asymptotically AdS$_{d+1}$ hairy black holes in an analytically controllable setup. The black holes are exact solutions to an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory and include the well-known Gubser-Rocha model. After reviewing the setup, we scrutinize the geometry beyond the horizon, finding that these backgrounds can exhibit timelike or Kasner singularities. We generalize the no inner-horizon theorem for hairy black holes to accommodate these findings. We then consider observables sensitive to the geometry behind the horizon, such as Complexity = Anything and the thermal $a$-function. In the Kasner case, we propose a new variant of complexity that characterizes the late-time rate by the Kasner exponents, extending previous work by J{\o}rstad, Myers and Ruan. Additionally, we elucidate the power-law behavior of the thermal $a$-function near the singularity, directly relating it to the Kasner exponents. Finally, we introduce axion-like fields in the Gubser-Rocha model to study the impact of translational symmetry breaking on the black hole interior. We show that Kasner singularities occur for both explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the Kasner exponents depending on the strength of broken translations only in the latter case.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements sample comprising of 20 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 33 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These 33 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples. The distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.8 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.51$ indicating some correlations. The one-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.48$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.37$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier measurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and MCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.95$, fully self-consistent and consistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>
