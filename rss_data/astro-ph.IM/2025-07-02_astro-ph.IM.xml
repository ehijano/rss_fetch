      <title>Ground calibration plan for the Athena/X-IFU microcalorimeter spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Integral Field Unit is the X-ray imaging spectrometer on-board one of ESA's next large missions, Athena. Athena is set to investigate the theme of the Hot and Energetic Universe, with a launch planned in the late-2030s. Based on a high sensitivity Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detector array operated at very low temperature (50 mK), X-IFU will provide spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy of the X-ray sky in the 0.2-12 keV energy band, with an energy resolution goal of 4 eV up to 7 keV [3 eV design goal]. This paper presents the current calibration plan of the X-IFU. It provides the requirements applicable to the X-IFU calibration, describes the overall calibration strategy, and details the procedure and sources needed for the ground calibration of each parameter or characteristics of the X-IFU.</description>

      <title>Ge-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{GeQuLEP} (Germanium-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics), a conceptual design for an advanced quantum sensing platform integrating high-purity germanium (Ge) crystals with engineered phononic crystal cavities. At cryogenic temperatures, these cavities naturally host dipole-bound states, effectively forming quantum dots coupled to radio-frequency quantum point contact (RF-QPC) readout systems. This innovative coupling approach promises ultra-sensitive phonon-mediated charge detection through phonon-induced charge displacement. GeQuLEP is specifically designed to achieve exceptionally low detection thresholds, theoretically enabling single primary phonon sensitivity with anticipated energy depositions as low as \textbf{0.00745~eV}. This unprecedented sensitivity, if realized experimentally, would provide unique access to searches for low-mass dark matter down to the keV/$c^2$ mass range via nuclear and electronic recoils. Additionally, GeQuLEP aims to facilitate the real-time detection of solar \textit{pp} neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). By combining phonon-based quantum transduction with quantum-classical hybrid readout schemes, the GeQuLEP architecture represents a scalable, contact-free phonon spectroscopy design that could significantly advance the capabilities of ultra-low-energy rare-event detection at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Searching for intermediate mass ratio binary black hole mergers in the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 &lt; q&lt;1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $&gt; 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.</description>

      <title>Avoiding (photo-$z$) Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral modeling codes that estimate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are a powerful and often reliable method for determining redshifts of galaxies. However, there are notable instances where degeneracies in spectral energy distribution (SED) colors lead to `catastrophic' failures. We highlight the case of COSBO-7, a dusty, intermediate-$z$ galaxy that masqueraded as a high-$z$ source, because it demonstrates a unique scenario where photo-$z$ codes run into issues despite extensive multi-wavelength photometry. We advocate that photo-$z$ fitting should aim to: (1) use the entire available SED (UV--radio) whenever possible to help break color degeneracies, (2) allow flexible dust attenuation prescriptions, both in terms of the attenuation curve slope and a varying 2175{\AA} absorption feature, and (3) implement uncertainty floors to account for limitations in spectral models and also on the photometry itself.</description>

      <title>47 Tuc in Rubin Data Preview 1: Exploring Early LSST Data and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid stream identification with HDBSCAN unsupervised clustering algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.</description>

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>

      <title>Time domain astrophysics with transient sources. Delay estimate via Cross Correlation Function techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing analysis of transient events allows for investigating numerous still open areas of modern astrophysics. The article explores all the mathematical and physical tools required to estimate delays and associated errors between two Times of Arrival (ToA) lists, by exploiting Cross Correlation Function (CCF) techniques. The CCF permits the establishment of the delay between two observed signals and is defined on two continuous functions. A detector does not directly measure the intensity of the electromagnetic signal (interacting with its material) but rather detects each photon ToA through a probabilistic process. Since the CCF is defined on continuous functions, the crucial step is to obtain a continuous rate curve from a list of ToA. This step is treated in the article and the constructed rate functions are light curves that are continuous functions. This allows, in principle, the estimation of delays with any desired resolution. Due to the statistical nature of the measurement process, two independent detections of the same signal yield different photon times. Consequently, light curves derived from these lists differ due to Poisson fluctuations, leading the CCF between them to fluctuate around the true theoretical delay. This article describes a Monte Carlo technique that enables reliable delay estimation by providing a robust measure of the uncertainties induced by Poissonian fluctuations. GRB data are considered as they offer optimal test cases for the proposed techniques. The developed techniques provides a significant computational advantage and are useful analyzing of data characterized by low-count statistics (i.e., low photon count rates in c/s), as they allow overcoming the limitations associated with traditional fixed bin-size methods.</description>
