      <title>Conclusions Not Yet Drawn from the Unsolved 4/3-Problem -- How to Get a Stable Classical Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for over 100 years that there is a discrepancy between Maxwell's electrodynamics and the idea of a classical electron as the ``atom'' of electricity. This incompatibility is known under the terms 4/3 problem of the classical electron and radiation reaction force and was circumvented in the currently most successful theories, the quantum field theories, by limit value considerations, by the mutual subtraction of infinities, i.e., by purely mathematical methods that eliminate obvious contradictions but are not really based on an intuitive understanding of its physical causes. The actual origin of the problems mentioned lies in the instability of the classical electron. Stabilization cannot be achieved within the framework of Maxwell's electrodynamics. This raises the question of what a minimal change to the fundamentals of electrodynamics should look like, which contains Maxwell's theory as a limiting case. A detailed analysis of the 4/3 problem points to models that fulfill these requirements.</description>

      <title>Equation of State for Tachyon Neutrinos in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports improvements and new results for a well developed theory of tachyons (faster-than-light particles) and follows the suggestion that neutrinos - especially the low energy neutrinos in the Cosmic Neutrino Background - may be tachyons. Starting with an application of the Thomas-Fermi method for studying a mass of particles obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, we find the following (and unusual) equations of state: $p \sim n^{1/2} \sim \rho^{1/3}$ , where n is the particle number density, $\rho$ is the energy density, and $p$ is the pressure.
  We then use these relations in the FLRW model for the evolution of the universe, focusing on the dominant role of the tachyon pressure. The result is a simple formula for the scale factor a(t); and this is found to provide an excellent fit to the famous observational data plotting "Luminosity distance" vs redshift from Type Ia supernovae. There are no free parameters in this theory; and the major uncertainty is an estimate of the tachyon mass at $0.1 eV/c^2$.
  With successful quantitative explanations for both Dark Energy and Dark Matter, this tachyon-neutrino theory is presented as a strong alternative to the currently popular $\Lambda CDM$ theory.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi Treatment of Constraint Field Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Hamilton$-$Jacobi approach of fields with constraints, we analyse the classical structure of three different constrained field systems: (i) the scalar field coupled to two flavors of fermions through Yukawa couplings (ii) the scalar field coupled minimally to the vector potential (iii) the electromagnetic field coupled to a spinor. The equations of motion are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. The integrability conditions are investigated. The second and third constrained systems are quantized using canonical path integral formulation based on the Hamilton$-$Jacobi treatment.</description>

      <title>General Relativity as an EFT with emergent gravity via principle of spatial energy potentiality: implications for the standard model of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments demonstrate that General Relativity (GR) is as an effective field theory (EFT) with a limited domain of validity, undergoing a breakdown of its fundamental symmetry in strong fields and exhibiting only one-loop finiteness in a perturbative expansion. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{Principle of Spatial Energy Potentiality}, wherein both time \emph{and} gravity emerge from a purely spatial, high-energy configuration. This framework reinterprets the Big Bang as a phase transition from 3D space to 4D spacetime, thereby avoiding traditional singularities and offering alternative early-universe dynamics. We illustrate these ideas with toy-model derivations and discuss potential observational consequences, arguing that new principles beyond fundamental covariance are needed to address gravity in both weak- and strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Applications of geometric algebra to black holes and Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0412070</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0412070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   We discuss the applications of Gauge Theory of Gravity (GTG) within the language of geometric algebra to black holes and Hawking radiation. Applications include the Unruh effect, the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations in several backgrounds, such as the de Sitter and Rindler metrics as well as spherically and axially black hole backgrounds. The analysis is also generalised to allow the presence of magnetic monopoles. We rederive the Hawking temperature for all cases. The derivation of both the correct Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics as well as the Hawking temperature may suggest that the method of calculations we employ here - geometric algebra - is really powerful in dealing with the problems in various strong gravitational backgrounds.</description>
