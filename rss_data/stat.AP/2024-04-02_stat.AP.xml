      <title>Reverse stress testing via multivariate modeling with vine copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important tool in financial risk management, stress testing aims to evaluate the stability of financial portfolios under some potential large shocks from extreme yet plausible scenarios of risk factors. The effectiveness of a stress test crucially depends on the choice of stress scenarios. In this paper we consider a pragmatic approach to stress scenario estimation that aims to address several practical challenges in the context of real life financial portfolios of currencies from a bank. Our method utilizes a flexible multivariate modelling framework based on vine copulas.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Imputation With Granular Semantics and AI-driven Pipeline for Bankruptcy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a pipeline for the prediction of bankruptcy. The presence of missing values, high dimensional data, and highly class-imbalance databases are the major challenges in the said task. A new method for missing data imputation with granular semantics has been introduced here. The merits of granular computing have been explored here to define this method. The missing values have been predicted using the feature semantics and reliable observations in a low-dimensional space, in the granular space. The granules are formed around every missing entry, considering a few of the highly correlated features and most reliable closest observations to preserve the relevance and reliability, the context, of the database against the missing entries. An intergranular prediction is then carried out for the imputation within those contextual granules. That is, the contextual granules enable a small relevant fraction of the huge database to be used for imputation and overcome the need to access the entire database repetitively for each missing value. This method is then implemented and tested for the prediction of bankruptcy with the Polish Bankruptcy dataset. It provides an efficient solution for big and high-dimensional datasets even with large imputation rates. Then an AI-driven pipeline for bankruptcy prediction has been designed using the proposed granular semantic-based data filling method followed by the solutions to the issues like high dimensional dataset and high class-imbalance in the dataset. The rest of the pipeline consists of feature selection with the random forest for reducing dimensionality, data balancing with SMOTE, and prediction with six different popular classifiers including deep NN. All methods defined here have been experimentally verified with suitable comparative studies and proven to be effective on all the data sets captured over the five years.</description>

      <title>Direction Preferring Confidence Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confidence intervals (CIs) are instrumental in statistical analysis, providing a range estimate of the parameters. In modern statistics, selective inference is common, where only certain parameters are highlighted. However, this selective approach can bias the inference, leading some to advocate for the use of CIs over p-values. To increase the flexibility of confidence intervals, we introduce direction-preferring CIs, enabling analysts to focus on parameters trending in a particular direction. We present these types of CIs in two settings: First, when there is no selection of parameters; and second, for situations involving parameter selection, where we offer a conditional version of the direction-preferring CIs. Both of these methods build upon the foundations of Modified Pratt CIs, which rely on non-equivariant acceptance regions to achieve longer intervals in exchange for improved sign exclusions. We show that for selected parameters out of m &gt; 1 initial parameters of interest, CIs aimed at controlling the false coverage rate, have higher power to determine the sign compared to conditional CIs. We also show that conditional confidence intervals control the marginal false coverage rate (mFCR) under any dependency.</description>

      <title>Loss-based prior for tree topologies in BART models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel prior for tree topology within Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) models. This approach quantifies the hypothetical loss in information and the loss due to complexity associated with choosing the wrong tree structure. The resulting prior distribution is compellingly geared toward sparsity, a critical feature considering BART models' tendency to overfit. Our method incorporates prior knowledge into the distribution via two parameters that govern the tree's depth and balance between its left and right branches. Additionally, we propose a default calibration for these parameters, offering an objective version of the prior. We demonstrate our method's efficacy on both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Attack Detection on a Blockchain Network as a Non-Parametric Change Detection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel non-parametric change detection algorithm to identify eclipse attacks on a blockchain network; the non-parametric algorithm relies only on the empirical mean and variance of the dataset, making it highly adaptable. An eclipse attack occurs when malicious actors isolate blockchain users, disrupting their ability to reach consensus with the broader network, thereby distorting their local copy of the ledger. To detect an eclipse attack, we monitor changes in the Fr\'echet mean and variance of the evolving blockchain communication network connecting blockchain users. First, we leverage the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to project large-dimensional networks into a lower-dimensional space, preserving essential statistical properties. Subsequently, we employ a non-parametric change detection procedure, leading to a test statistic that converges weakly to a Brownian bridge process in the absence of an eclipse attack. This enables us to quantify the false alarm rate of the detector. Our detector can be implemented as a smart contract on the blockchain, offering a tamper-proof and reliable solution. Finally, we use numerical examples to compare the proposed eclipse attack detector with a detector based on the random forest model.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis by Semiparametric Additive Regression and LSTM-FCN Based Hierarchical Classification for Computer Vision Quantification of Parkinsonian Bradykinesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bradykinesia, characterized by involuntary slowing or decrement of movement, is a fundamental symptom of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is vital for its clinical diagnosis. Despite various methodologies explored to quantify bradykinesia, computer vision-based approaches have shown promising results. However, these methods often fall short in adequately addressing key bradykinesia characteristics in repetitive limb movements: "occasional arrest" and "decrement in amplitude."
  This research advances vision-based quantification of bradykinesia by introducing nuanced numerical analysis to capture decrement in amplitudes and employing a simple deep learning technique, LSTM-FCN, for precise classification of occasional arrests. Our approach structures the classification process hierarchically, tailoring it to the unique dynamics of bradykinesia in PD.
  Statistical analysis of the extracted features, including those representing arrest and fatigue, has demonstrated their statistical significance in most cases. This finding underscores the importance of considering "occasional arrest" and "decrement in amplitude" in bradykinesia quantification of limb movement. Our enhanced diagnostic tool has been rigorously tested on an extensive dataset comprising 1396 motion videos from 310 PD patients, achieving an accuracy of 80.3%. The results confirm the robustness and reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Network Regularized Regression for Modeling Urban Crime Occurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.05047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyses of occurrences of residential burglary in urban areas have shown that crime rates are not spatially homogeneous: rates vary across the network of city streets, resulting in some areas being far more susceptible to crime than others. The explanation for why a certain segment of the city experiences high crime may be different than why a neighboring area experiences high crime. Motivated by the importance of understanding spatial patterns such as these, we consider a statistical model of burglary defined on the street network of Boston, Massachusetts. Leveraging ideas from functional data analysis, our proposed solution consists of a generalized linear model with vertex-indexed covariates, allowing for an interpretation of the covariate effects at the street level. We employ a regularization procedure cast as a prior distribution on the regression coefficients under a Bayesian setup, so that the predicted responses vary smoothly according to the connectivity of the city. We introduce a novel variable selection procedure, examine computationally efficient methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, and demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed modeling structure. The resulting model and interpretations provide insight into the spatial network patterns and dynamics of residential burglary in Boston.</description>

      <title>Visually Evaluating Generative Adversarial Networks Using Itself under Multivariate Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visually evaluating the goodness of generated Multivariate Time Series (MTS) are difficult to implement, especially in the case that the generative model is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We present a general framework named Gaussian GANs to visually evaluate GANs using itself under the MTS generation task. Firstly, we attempt to find the transformation function in the multivariate Kolmogorov Smirnov (MKS) test by explicitly reconstructing the architecture of GANs. Secondly, we conduct the normality test of transformed MST where the Gaussian GANs serves as the transformation function in the MKS test. In order to simplify the normality test, an efficient visualization is proposed using the chi square distribution. In the experiment, we use the UniMiB dataset and provide empirical evidence showing that the normality test using Gaussian GANs and chi sqaure visualization is effective and credible.</description>

      <title>Poisson Cluster Process Models for Detecting Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel set of Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) models to detect Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), a class of extremely faint, enigmatic galaxies of substantial interest in modern astrophysics. We model the unobserved UDG locations as parent points in a PCP, and infer their positions based on the observed spatial point patterns of their old star cluster systems. Many UDGs have somewhere from a few to hundreds of these old star clusters, which we treat as offspring points in our models. We also present a new framework to construct a marked PCP model using the marks of star clusters. The marked PCP model may enhance the detection of UDGs and offers broad applicability to problems in other disciplines. To assess the overall model performance, we design an innovative assessment tool for spatial prediction problems where only point-referenced ground truth is available, overcoming the limitation of standard ROC analyses where spatial Boolean reference maps are required. We construct a bespoke blocked Gibbs adaptive spatial birth-death-move MCMC algorithm to infer the locations of UDGs using real data from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging survey. Based on our performance assessment tool, our novel models significantly outperform existing approaches using the Log-Gaussian Cox Process. We also obtained preliminary evidence that the marked PCP model improves UDG detection performance compared to the model without marks. Furthermore, we find evidence of a potential new ``dark galaxy'' that was not detected by previous methods.</description>

      <title>Safe and Interpretable Estimation of Optimal Treatment Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical and reinforcement learning methods have significantly advanced patient care strategies. However, these approaches face substantial challenges in high-stakes contexts, including missing data, inherent stochasticity, and the critical requirements for interpretability and patient safety. Our work operationalizes a safe and interpretable framework to identify optimal treatment regimes. This approach involves matching patients with similar medical and pharmacological characteristics, allowing us to construct an optimal policy via interpolation. We perform a comprehensive simulation study to demonstrate the framework's ability to identify optimal policies even in complex settings. Ultimately, we operationalize our approach to study regimes for treating seizures in critically ill patients. Our findings strongly support personalized treatment strategies based on a patient's medical history and pharmacological features. Notably, we identify that reducing medication doses for patients with mild and brief seizure episodes while adopting aggressive treatment for patients in intensive care unit experiencing intense seizures leads to more favorable outcomes.</description>

      <title>The general linear hypothesis testing problem for multivariate functional data with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, the prevalence of multivariate functional data (MFD) has expanded across diverse disciplines, spanning biology, climatology, finance, and numerous other fields of study. Although MFD are encountered in various fields, the development of methods for hypotheses on mean functions, especially the general linear hypothesis testing (GLHT) problem for such data has been limited. In this study, we propose and study a new global test for the GLHT problem for MFD, which includes the one-way FMANOVA, post hoc, and contrast analysis as special cases. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is shown to be a chi-squared-type mixture dependent of eigenvalues of the heteroscedastic covariance functions. The distribution of the chi-squared-type mixture can be well approximated by a three-cumulant matched chi-squared-approximation with its approximation parameters estimated from the data. By incorporating an adjustment coefficient, the proposed test performs effectively irrespective of the correlation structure in the functional data, even when dealing with a relatively small sample size. Additionally, the proposed test is shown to be root-n consistent, that is, it has a nontrivial power against a local alternative. Simulation studies and a real data example demonstrate finite-sample performance and broad applicability of the proposed test.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor at Mars with Uncertainty Quantification using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single spacecraft missions do not measure the pristine solar wind continuously because of the spacecrafts' orbital trajectory. The infrequent spatiotemporal cadence of measurement fundamentally limits conclusions about solar wind-magnetosphere coupling throughout the solar system. At Mars, such single spacecraft missions result in limitations for assessing the solar wind's role in causing lower altitude observations such as auroral dynamics or atmospheric loss. In this work, we detail the development of a virtual solar wind monitor from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission; a single spacecraft. This virtual solar wind monitor provides a continuous estimate of the solar wind upstream from Mars with uncertainties. We specifically employ Gaussian process regression to estimate the upstream solar wind and uncertainty estimations that scale with the data sparsity of our real observations. This proxy enables continuous solar wind estimation at Mars with representative uncertainties for the majority of the time since since late 2014. We conclude by discussing suggested uses of this virtual solar wind monitor for statistical studies of the Mars space environment and heliosphere.</description>
