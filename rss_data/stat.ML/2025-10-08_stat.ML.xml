      <title>Minima and Critical Points of the Bethe Free Energy Are Invariant Under Deformation Retractions of Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graphical models, factor graphs, and more generally energy-based models, the interactions between variables are encoded by a graph, a hypergraph, or, in the most general case, a partially ordered set (poset). Inference on such probabilistic models cannot be performed exactly due to cycles in the underlying structures of interaction. Instead, one resorts to approximate variational inference by optimizing the Bethe free energy. Critical points of the Bethe free energy correspond to fixed points of the associated Belief Propagation algorithm. A full characterization of these critical points for general graphs, hypergraphs, and posets with a finite number of variables is still an open problem. We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of length at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model to one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical points of the associated free energy. This result extends and unifies classical results that assume specific forms of collapsibility to prove uniqueness of the critical points of the Bethe free energy.</description>

      <title>Refereed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation of learning tasks in a setting where the learner is given access to two competing provers, only one of which is honest. Specifically, we consider the power of such learners in assessing purported properties of opaque models. Following prior work that considers the power of competing provers in different settings, we call this setting refereed learning.
  After formulating a general definition of refereed learning tasks, we show refereed learning protocols that obtain a level of accuracy that far exceeds what is obtainable at comparable cost without provers, or even with a single prover. We concentrate on the task of choosing the better one out of two black-box models, with respect to some ground truth. While we consider a range of parameters, perhaps our most notable result is in the high-precision range: For all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and ambient dimension $d$, our learner makes only one query to the ground truth function, communicates only $(1+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})\cdot\text{poly}(d)$ bits with the provers, and outputs a model whose loss is within a multiplicative factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ of the best model's loss. Obtaining comparable loss with a single prover would require the learner to access the ground truth at almost all of the points in the domain. To obtain this bound, we develop a technique that allows the learner to sample, using the provers, from a distribution that is not efficiently samplable to begin with. We find this technique to be of independent interest.
  We also present lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our protocols in a number of respects, including prover complexity, number of samples, and need for query access.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Basis for Low-Rank Matrix Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low rank inference on matrices is widely conducted by optimizing a cost function augmented with a penalty proportional to the nuclear norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$. However, despite the assortment of computational methods for such problems, there is a surprising lack of understanding of the underlying probability distributions being referred to. In this article, we study the distribution with density $f(X)\propto e^{-\lambda\Vert X\Vert_*}$, finding many of its fundamental attributes to be analytically tractable via differential geometry. We use these facts to design an improved MCMC algorithm for low rank Bayesian inference as well as to learn the penalty parameter $\lambda$, obviating the need for hyperparameter tuning when this is difficult or impossible. Finally, we deploy these to improve the accuracy and efficiency of low rank Bayesian matrix denoising and completion algorithms in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications. Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift, often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Bilevel optimization for learning hyperparameters: Application to solving PDEs and inverse problems with Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for solving scientific computing and inference problems, such as kernel- and neural network-based approaches for partial differential equations (PDEs), inverse problems, and supervised learning tasks, depend crucially on the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, the efficacy of such methods, and in particular their accuracy, stability, and generalization properties, strongly depends on the choice of hyperparameters. While bilevel optimization offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step. Our approach provides closed-form updates, eliminating the need for repeated costly PDE solves. As a result, each iteration of the outer loop reduces to a single linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and to PDE inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments highlight substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization. In particular, experiments with additive kernels and neural network-parameterized deep kernels demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Continual Learning with Gradient Descent for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning, the ability of a model to adapt to an ongoing sequence of tasks without forgetting the earlier ones, is a central goal of artificial intelligence. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, we analyze the limitations of continual learning in a tractable yet representative setting. In particular, we study one-hidden-layer quadratic neural networks trained by gradient descent on an XOR cluster dataset with Gaussian noise, where different tasks correspond to different clusters with orthogonal means. Our results obtain bounds on the rate of forgetting during train and test-time in terms of the number of iterations, the sample size, the number of tasks, and the hidden-layer size. Our results reveal interesting phenomena on the role of different problem parameters in the rate of forgetting. Numerical experiments across diverse setups confirm our results, demonstrating their validity beyond the analyzed settings.</description>

      <title>Implicit Updates for Average-Reward Temporal Difference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning. In the average-reward setting, standard TD($\lambda$) is highly sensitive to the choice of step-size and thus requires careful tuning to maintain numerical stability. We introduce average-reward implicit TD($\lambda$), which employs an implicit fixed point update to provide data-adaptive stabilization while preserving the per iteration computational complexity of standard average-reward TD($\lambda$). In contrast to prior finite-time analyses of average-reward TD($\lambda$), which impose restrictive step-size conditions, we establish finite-time error bounds for the implicit variant under substantially weaker step-size requirements. Empirically, average-reward implicit TD($\lambda$) operates reliably over a much broader range of step-sizes and exhibits markedly improved numerical stability. This enables more efficient policy evaluation and policy learning, highlighting its effectiveness as a robust alternative to average-reward TD($\lambda$).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Configuration Allocation in Pre-Production Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments. Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.</description>

      <title>Aneurysm Growth Time Series Reconstruction Using Physics-informed Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries, the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US. Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.
  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prediction of Pass@k Scaling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.</description>

      <title>Tensor-on-tensor Regression Neural Networks for Process Modeling with High-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous, high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two paradigms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.</description>

      <title>Prior-Aligned Meta-RL: Thompson Sampling with Learned Priors and Guarantees in Finite-Horizon MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions. Specifically, we posit a linear representation $Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $ \mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters $\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and (ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain $\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance $\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation, covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Adoption under Discrete Overdispersed Demand: A Negative Binomial Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective supply chain management under high-variance demand requires models that jointly address demand uncertainty and digital contracting adoption. Existing research often simplifies demand variability or treats adoption as an exogenous decision, limiting relevance in e-commerce and humanitarian logistics. This study develops an optimization framework combining dynamic Negative Binomial (NB) demand modeling with endogenous smart contract adoption. The NB process incorporates autoregressive dynamics in success probability to capture overdispersion and temporal correlation. Simulation experiments using four real-world datasets, including Delhivery Logistics and the SCMS Global Health Delivery system, apply maximum likelihood estimation and grid search to optimize adoption intensity and order quantity. Across all datasets, the NB specification outperforms Poisson and Gaussian benchmarks, with overdispersion indices exceeding 1.5. Forecasting comparisons show that while ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing achieve similar point accuracy, the NB model provides superior stability under high variance. Scenario analysis reveals that when dispersion exceeds a critical threshold (r &gt; 6), increasing smart contract adoption above 70% significantly enhances profitability and service levels. This framework offers actionable guidance for balancing inventory costs, service levels, and implementation expenses, highlighting the importance of aligning digital adoption strategies with empirically observed demand volatility.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo-Type Neural Operator for Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).</description>

      <title>Mitigating Premature Exploitation in Particle-based Monte Carlo for Inference-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation: it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode, known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique, Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection from Small Training Sets using Bayesian Neural Network Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety, yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Gibbs and Langevin Monte Carlo Algorithms in the Interpolation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories. However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings, limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data, and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these applications.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Data and Tasks: Theories of Locality and Compositionality in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.</description>

      <title>PolyGraph Discrepancy: a classifier-based metric for graph generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters, namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors. The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients (IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a few examples.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Gaussian processes for online uncertainty quantification over graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However, such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature (RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in CP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) was developed to provide finite-sample probabilistic prediction guarantees. While CP algorithms are a relatively general-purpose approach to uncertainty quantification, with finite-sample guarantees, they lack versatility. Namely, the CP approach does not {\em prescribe} how to quantify the degree to which a data set provides evidence in support of (or against) an arbitrary event from a general class of events. In this paper, tools are offered from imprecise probability theory to build a formal connection between CP and generalized fiducial (GF) inference. These new insights establish a more general inferential lens from which CP can be understood, and demonstrate the pragmatism of fiducial ideas. The formal connection establishes a context in which epistemically-derived GF probability matches aleatoric/frequentist probability. Beyond this fact, it is illustrated how tools from imprecise probability theory, namely lower and upper probability functions, can be applied in the context of the imprecise GF distribution to provide posterior-like, prescriptive inference that is not possible within the CP framework alone. In addition to the primary CP generalization that is contributed, fundamental connections are synthesized between this new model-free GF and three other areas of contemporary research: nonparametric predictive inference (NPI), conformal predictive systems/distributions, and inferential models (IMs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a widely used framework for constructing valid prediction sets in classification and regression tasks. In this work, we extend the split conformal prediction framework to hierarchical classification, where prediction sets are commonly restricted to internal nodes of a predefined hierarchy, and propose two computationally efficient inference algorithms. The first algorithm returns internal nodes as prediction sets, while the second one relaxes this restriction. Using the notion of representation complexity, the latter yields smaller set sizes at the cost of a more general and combinatorial inference problem. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in achieving nominal coverage.</description>

      <title>Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</description>

      <title>An inexact LPA for DC composite optimization and application to matrix completions with outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16822v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns a class of DC composite optimization problems which, as an extension of convex composite optimization problems and DC programs with nonsmooth components, often arises in robust factorization models of low-rank matrix recovery. For this class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, we propose an inexact linearized proximal algorithm (iLPA) by computing at each step an inexact minimizer of a strongly convex majorization constructed with a partial linearization of their objective functions at the current iterate. We establish the full convergence of the generated iterate sequence under the Kurdyka-\L\"ojasiewicz (KL) property of a potential function, and employ the composite structure to provide a verifiable condition for the potential function to satisfy the KL property of exponent $1/2$ at the limit point, so for the iterate sequence to have a local R-linear convergence rate. This condition is weaker than the one provided in \cite[Theorem 3.2]{LiPong18} for identifying the KL property of exponent $p\in[0,1)$ for a general composite function. The proposed iLPA is applied to a robust factorization model for matrix completion with outliers and non-uniform sampling, and numerical comparisons with the Polyak subgradient method and a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) method validate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Stochastic Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In stochastic convex optimization problems, most existing adaptive methods rely on prior knowledge about the diameter bound $D$ when the smoothness or the Lipschitz constant is unknown. This often significantly affects performance as only a rough approximation of $D$ is usually known in practice. Here, we bypass this limitation by combining mirror descent with dual averaging techniques and we show that, under oblivious step-sizes regime, our algorithms converge without any prior knowledge on the parameters of the problem. We introduce three oblivious stochastic algorithms to address different settings. The first algorithm is designed for objectives in relative scale, the second one is an accelerated version tailored for smooth objectives, whereas the last one is for relatively-smooth objectives. All three algorithms work without prior knowledge of the diameter of the feasible set, the Lipschitz constant or smoothness of the objective function. We use these results to revisit the problem of solving large-scale semidefinite programs using randomized first-order methods and stochastic smoothing. We extend our framework to relative scale and demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our methods on large-scale semidefinite programs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the majorized PAM method with subspace correction for low-rank composite factorization model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the convergence certificates of the majorized proximal alternating minimization (PAM) method with subspace correction, proposed in \cite{TaoQianPan22} for the column $\ell_{2,0}$-norm regularized factorization model and now extended to a class of low-rank composite factorization models from matrix completion. The convergence analysis of this PAM method becomes extremely challenging because a subspace correction step is introduced to every proximal subproblem to ensure a closed-form solution. We establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence and column subspace sequences of factor pairs generated by the PAM, under the KL property of the objective function and a condition that holds automatically for the column $\ell_{2,0}$-norm function. Numerical comparison with the popular proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) method is conducted on one-bit matrix completion problems, which indicates that the PAM with subspace correction has an advantage in seeking lower relative error within less time.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for the Alignments of Partially Correlated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering the hidden vertex correspondence between two correlated random graphs. We propose the partially correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model, wherein a pair of induced subgraphs with a certain number are correlated. We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering the latent correlated subgraphs and the hidden vertex correspondence. We prove that there exists an optimal rate for partial recovery for the number of correlated nodes, above which one can correctly match a fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, and we also derive an optimal rate for exact recovery. In the proof of possibility results, we propose correlated functional digraphs, which partition the edges of the intersection graph into two types of components, and bound the error probability by lower-order cumulant generating functions. The proof of impossibility results build upon the generalized Fano's inequality and the recovery thresholds settled in correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs model.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach extends the Information Bottleneck principle to heterogeneous data through generalised product kernels, integrating continuous, nominal, and ordinal variables within a unified optimization framework. We address the following challenges: developing a systematic bandwidth selection strategy that equalises contributions across variable types, and proposing an adaptive hyperparameter updating scheme that ensures a valid solution into a predetermined number of potentially imbalanced clusters. Through simulations on 28,800 synthetic data sets and ten publicly available benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method, named DIBmix, achieves superior performance compared to four established methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, FAMD with K-Means, and PAM with Gower's dissimilarity). Results show DIBmix particularly excels when clusters exhibit size imbalances, data contain low or moderate cluster overlap, and categorical and continuous variables are equally represented. The method presents a significant advantage over traditional centroid-based algorithms, establishing DIBmix as a competitive and theoretically grounded alternative for mixed-type data clustering.</description>

      <title>SKADA-Bench: Benchmarking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods with Realistic Validation On Diverse Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11676v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors. SKADA-bench is available on Github at https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada-bench.</description>

      <title>AuToMATo: An Out-Of-The-Box Persistence-Based Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AuToMATo, a novel clustering algorithm based on persistent homology. While AuToMATo is not parameter-free per se, we provide default choices for its parameters that make it into an out-of-the-box clustering algorithm that performs well across the board. AuToMATo combines the existing ToMATo clustering algorithm with a bootstrapping procedure in order to separate significant peaks of an estimated density function from non-significant ones. We perform a thorough comparison of AuToMATo (with its parameters fixed to their defaults) against many other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We find not only that AuToMATo compares favorably against parameter-free clustering algorithms, but in many instances also significantly outperforms even the best selection of parameters for other algorithms. AuToMATo is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, in particular the Mapper algorithm, where it is desirable to work with a clustering algorithm that does not need tuning of its parameters. Indeed, we provide evidence that AuToMATo performs well when used with Mapper. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of AuToMATo in Python that is fully compatible with the standard scikit-learn architecture.</description>

      <title>Binding Affinity Prediction: From Conventional to Machine Learning-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding is the process by which a small molecule (drug or inhibitor) attaches to a target protein. Binding affinity, which characterizes the strength of biomolecular interactions, is essential for tackling diverse challenges in life sciences, including therapeutic design, protein engineering, enzyme optimization, and elucidating biological mechanisms. Much work has been devoted to predicting binding affinity over the past decades. Here, we review recent significant works, with a focus on methods, evaluation strategies, and benchmark datasets. We note growing use of both traditional machine learning and deep learning models for predicting binding affinity, accompanied by an increasing amount of data on proteins and small drug-like molecules. With improved predictive performance and the FDA's phasing out of animal testing, AI-driven in silico models, such as AI virtual cells (AIVCs), are poised to advance binding affinity prediction; reciprocally, progress in building binding affinity predictors can refine AIVCs. Future efforts in binding affinity prediction and AI-driven in silico models can enhance the simulation of temporal dynamics, cell-type specificity, and multi-omics integration to support more accurate and personalized outcomes.</description>

      <title>Anchors Aweigh! Sail for Optimal Unified Multi-Modal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified representation space in multi-modal learning is essential for effectively integrating diverse data sources, such as text, images, and audio, to enhance efficiency and performance across various downstream tasks. Recent binding methods, such as ImageBind, typically rely on a single, fixed anchor modality for aligning multi-modal data. We mathematically analyze these fixed anchor binding methods and uncover significant limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the anchor modality, (2) inadequate capture of intra-modal information, and (3) failure to account for cross-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities. To address these issues, we propose the need for adaptive anchor binding methods, exemplified by our framework CentroBind. The proposed method uses adaptively adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available modalities, leading to a balanced and rich representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach captures three critical properties of multi-modal learning -- intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multi-modal alignment -- while constructing a unified representation that spans all modalities. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that adaptive anchor methods such as CentroBind consistently outperform fixed anchor binding methods, verifying our analysis.</description>

      <title>Conjugate gradient methods for high-dimensional GLMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are a widely used tool in statistical analysis. The main bottleneck of many computational approaches lies in the inversion of the high dimensional precision matrices associated with the random effects. Such matrices are typically sparse; however, the sparsity pattern resembles a multi partite random graph, which does not lend itself well to default sparse linear algebra techniques. Notably, we show that, for typical GLMMs, the Cholesky factor is dense even when the original precision is sparse. We thus turn to approximate iterative techniques, in particular to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. We combine a detailed analysis of the spectrum of said precision matrices with results from random graph theory to show that CG-based methods applied to high-dimensional GLMMs typically achieve a fixed approximation error with a total cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters and observations. Numerical illustrations with both real and simulated data confirm the theoretical findings, while at the same time illustrating situations, such as nested structures, where CG-based methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Can foundation models actively gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models excel at single-turn reasoning but struggle with multi-turn exploration in dynamic environments, a requirement for many real-world challenges. We evaluated these models on their ability to learn from experience, adapt, and gather information. First, in "Feature World," a simple setting for testing information gathering, models performed near-optimally. However, to test more complex, multi-trial learning, we implemented a text-based version of the "Alchemy" environment, a benchmark for meta-learning. Here, agents must deduce a latent causal structure by integrating information across many trials. In this setting, recent foundation models initially failed to improve their performance over time. Crucially, we found that prompting the models to summarize their observations at regular intervals enabled an emergent meta-learning process. This allowed them to improve across trials and even adaptively re-learn when the environment's rules changed unexpectedly. While most models handled the simple task, Alchemy revealed stark differences in robustness: Gemini 2.5 performed best, followed by Claude 3.7, while ChatGPT-4o and o4-mini struggled. This underscores Alchemy's value as a benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that the biggest challenge for foundation models is not selecting informative actions in the moment, but integrating knowledge through adaptive strategies over time. Encouragingly, there appears to be no intrinsic barrier to future models mastering these abilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two instantiation--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Weighted Number of Tardy Jobs: Data-Driven Heuristic for Single-Machine Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Part I of this work [Gao25] establishes online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online convex optimization to adapt stepsizes in gradient methods. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of OSGM. We leverage the OSGM framework to design new adaptive first-order methods and provide insights into their empirical behavior. The resulting method, OSGM-Best, matches the performance of quasi-Newton variants while requiring less memory and cheaper iterations. We also extend OSGM to nonconvex optimization and outline directions that connect OSGM to existing branches of optimization theory and practice.</description>

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and 91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Distilled Protein Backbone Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03095</link>

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03949</link>

Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>
