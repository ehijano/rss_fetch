      <title>Reaction Coordinates are Optimal Channels of Energy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are the few essential coordinates of a protein that control its functional processes, such as allostery, enzymatic reaction, and conformational change. They are critical for understanding protein function and provide optimal enhanced sampling of protein conformational changes and states. Since the pioneering works in the late 1990s, identifying the correct and objectively provable RCs has been a central topic in molecular biophysics and chemical physics. This review summarizes the major advances in identifying RCs over the past 25 years, focusing on methods aimed at finding RCs that meet the rigorous committor criterion, widely accepted as the true RCs. Importantly, the newly developed physics-based energy flow theory and generalized work functional method provide a general and rigorous approach for identifying true RCs, revealing their physical nature as the optimal channels of energy flow in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Dynamic cost allocation allows network-forming forager to switch between search strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-forming organisms, like fungi and slime molds, dynamically reorganize their networks during foraging. The resulting re-routing of resource flows within the organism's network can significantly impact local ecosystems. In current analysis limitations stem from a focus on single-time-point morphology, hindering understanding of continuous dynamics and underlying constraints. Here, we study ongoing network reorganization in the foraging slime mold \textit{Physarum~polycephalum}, identifying three distinct states with varying morphology and migration velocity. We estimate the energetic cost of each state and find a trade-off between building and transport costs within the morphological variability, facilitating different search strategies. Adaptation of state population to the environment suggests that diverse network morphologies support varied foraging strategies, though constrained by associated costs. Our findings provide insights for evaluating the impact of resource flow re-routing in changing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Turbulent mixing controls fixation of growing antagonistic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike coffee and cream that homogenize when stirred, growing micro-organisms (e.g., bacteria, baker's yeast) can actively kill each other and avoid mixing. How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning strain that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.</description>

      <title>Epistatic pathways in evolvable mechanical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elastic spring network is an example of evolvable matter. It can be pruned to couple separated pairs of nodes so that when a strain is applied to one of them, the other responds either in-phase or out-of-phase. This produces two pruned networks with incompatible functions that are nearly identical but differ from each other by a set of "mutations," each of which removes or adds a single bond in the network. The effect of multiple mutations is epistatic; that is, the effect of a mutation depends on what other mutations have already occurred. We generate ensembles of network pairs that differ by a fixed number, $M$, of discrete mutations and evaluate all $M!$ mutational paths between the in- and out-of phase behaviors up to $M = 14$. With a threshold response for the network to be considered functional, so that non-functional networks are disallowed, only some mutational pathways are viable. We find that there is a surprisingly high critical response threshold above which no evolutionarily viable path exists between the two networks. The few remaining pathways at this critical value dictate much of the behavior along the evolutionary trajectory. In most cases, the mutations break up into two distinct classes. The analysis clarifies how the number of mutations and the position of a mutation along the pathway affect the evolutionary outcome.</description>

      <title>General Quantum Alchemical Free Energy Simulations via Hamiltonian Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of alchemical free energy simulations at the quantum mechanical level by directly interpolating the electronic Hamiltonian. The method is compatible with any level of electronic structure theory and requires only one quantum calculation for each molecular dynamics step in contrast to multiple energy evaluations that would be needed when interpolating the ground-state energies. We demonstrate the correctness and applicability of the technique by computing alchemical free energy changes of gas-phase molecules, with both nuclear and electron creation/annihilation. We also show an initial application to first-principles pKa calculation for solvated molecules where we quantum mechanically annihilate a bonded proton.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for the assessment of water fraction-dependent longitudinal decay rates and magnetisation transfer in membrane lipid phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phantom systems consisting of liposome suspensions are widely employed to investigate quantitative MRI parameters mimicking cellular membranes. The proper physical understanding of the measurement results, however, requires proper models for liposomes and their interaction with the surrounding water molecules. Here, we present an MD-based approach for the theoretical prediction of R1=1/T1, the dependence of R1 on water concentration and the magnetization exchange between lipids and interacting water layer in lipids and lipid mixtures. Moreover, a new parameter is introduced which quantitatively measures the amount of hydration water (hydration water fraction, f_HW) based on conventional spoiled gradient echo MR acquisitions. Both f_HW and the magnetisation exchange rate between lipids and hydration water were determined quantitatively from spoiled gradient echo data. We observed that liposome systems behaved similarly, apart from PLPC which showed both lower hydration water fraction and lower exchange rate. The extracted parameters accurately predicted the measured water fraction-dependent R1 rates and allowed for a theoretical understanding of MR parameters in liposomes of different composition.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Optimal Reaction Coordinates of Biomolecular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Flow Matching for Reaction Coordinates (FMRC), a novel deep learning algorithm designed to identify optimal reaction coordinates (RC) in biomolecular reversible dynamics. FMRC is based on the mathematical principles of lumpability and decomposability, which we reformulate into a conditional probability framework for efficient data-driven optimization using deep generative models. While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established transfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics of leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its low-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov State Models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the superiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems. Finally, we discuss its potential applications in downstream applications such as enhanced sampling methods and MSM construction.</description>

      <title>A Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both "runs-and-pirouettes" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.</description>

      <title>Uncovering quantum characteristics of incipient evolutions at the photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water oxidation of photosynthesis at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is driven by the polarization field induced by the photoelectric hole. By highlighting the role of the polarization field in reshaping the spin and orbit potentials, we reveal in this work the characteristics and underlying mechanism in the relatively simpler OEC evolutions within the states S0 - S2 prior to the water oxidation. The characteristic shifts of the density of states (DOS) of the electron donor Mn atom are observed in the vicinity of the Fermi surface to occur with the spin flips of Mn atoms and the change of the Mn oxidation states during the electron transfer. Notably, the spin flips of Mn atoms point to the resulting spin configuration of the next states. It is found that the electron transfer tend to stabilize the catalyst OEC itself, whereas the proton transfer pushes the evolution forward by preparing a new electron donor, demonstrating the proton-coupled electron transfer. Meanwhile, it shows that the Mn-O bonds around the candidate Mn atom of the electron donor undergo characteristic changes in the bond lengths during the electron transfer. These concomitant phenomena uncovered in first-principle calculations characterize the essential equilibrium of the OEC between the state evolution and stability that forms a ground of the dynamic OEC cycles. In particular, the characteristic undulation of the DOS around the Fermi level occurring at the proton-coupled electron transfer can be used to reveal crucial processes in a wide range of realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend establishing the Dedicated International Accelerator Laboratory for Space Travel related radiation research (DIAL-ST) to advance this field and evaluate protective biological pathways through particle accelerator experiments simulating cosmic radiation.</description>
