      <title>Ab Initio studies on strain-dependant thermal transport properties of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of graphene's thermal conductivity using first-principles density functional perturbation theory calculations, with a focus on the phonon and lattice vibrational properties underlying its superior heat transport capabilities. The study highlights the role of phonon frequencies, lifetimes and mode-resolved contributions in determining graphene's thermal performance, emphasizing its high phonon group velocities and long mean free paths that contribute to thermal conductivity exceeding 3000 W/mK at room temperature. The results are compared with other two-dimensional materials like silicene (10 W/mK) and MoS2 (83 W/mK), to underline graphene's advantages in nanoscale applications. Here we report the concept of "velocity-lifetime trade-off" and use it to explain graphene's excellent invariance to high tensile and compressive strains as it exhibits minimal variation in thermal conductivity, making it an ideal material for applications requiring stability in environments with strain variability and deformation. This study establishes graphene as a benchmark material for thermal transport in next-generation 2D channel FET devices and offers a roadmap for its optimization in practical applications.</description>

      <title>MAMBO: a lightweight ontology for multiscale materials and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements of both computational and experimental tools have recently led to significant progress in the development of new advanced and functional materials, paralleled by a quick growth of the overall amount of data and information on materials. However, an effective unfolding of the potential of advanced and data-intensive methodologies requires systematic and efficient methods for the organization of knowledge in the context of materials research and development. Semantic technologies can support the structured and formal organization of knowledge, providing a platform for the integration and interoperability of data. In this work, we introduce the Materials and Molecules Basic Ontology (MAMBO), which aims at organizing knowledge in the field of computational and experimental workflows on molecular materials and related systems (nanomaterials, supramolecular systems, molecular aggregates, etc.). Linking recent efforts on ontologies for materials sciences in neighboring domains, MAMBO aims at filling gaps in current state-of-the-art knowledge modelling approaches for materials development and design targeting the intersection between the molecular scale and higher scale domains. With a focus on operational processes, lightweight, and modularity, MAMBO enables extensions to broader knowledge domains and integration of methodologies and workflows related to both computational and experimental tools. MAMBO is expected to advance the application of data-driven technologies to molecular materials, including predictive machine learning frameworks for materials design and discovery and automated platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials (MTIs) including MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ are of scientific interest due to the possibility to reveal the interplay between topological and magnetic orders. For these materials preparation issues are still challenging. In our paper we report new synthetic protocol using two-phase source in Bridgman-like growth procedure. We applied it to grow a number of TIs of GeAs$_2$Te$_4$ structural type including individual compounds MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, MnSb$_2$Te$_4$, GeBi$_2$Te$_4$, SnBi$_2$Te$_4$, PbBi$_2$Te$_4$ and several mixed crystals of whole range of compositions: Mn(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_4$, (Ge,Mn)Bi$_2$Te$_4$, new materials Mn(Bi,In)$_2$Te$_4$. The method developed can be used to obtain single crystals of any incongruently melted compounds with small region of primary crystallization from melt in the corresponding equilibrium phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Quantum Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong starting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general overview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Automated Materials Discovery Platform Realized: Scanning Probe Microscopy of Combinatorial Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial libraries are a powerful approach for exploring the evolution of physical properties across binary and ternary cross-sections in multicomponent phase diagrams. Although the synthesis of these libraries has been developed since the 1960s and expedited with advanced laboratory automation, the broader application of combinatorial libraries relies on fast, reliable measurements of concentration-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer significant potential for quantitative, functionally relevant combi-library readouts. Here we demonstrate the implementation of fully automated SPM to explore the evolution of ferroelectric properties in combinatorial libraries, focusing on Sm-doped BiFeO3 and ZnxMg1-xO systems. We also present and compare Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization models for fully automated exploration, emphasizing local reproducibility (effective noise) as an essential factor in optimal experiment workflows. Automated SPM, when coupled with upstream synthesis controls, plays a pivotal role in bridging materials synthesis and characterization.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven electron density and effective model Hamiltonian for boron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique electron deficiency of boron makes it challenging to determine the stable structures, leading to a wide variety of forms. In this work, we introduce a statistical model based on grand canonical ensemble theory that incorporates the octet rule to determine electron density in boron systems. This parameter-free model, referred to as the bonding free energy (BFE) model, aligns well with first-principles calculations and accurately predicts total energies. For borane clusters, the model successfully predicts isomer energies, hydrogen diffusion pathways, and optimal charge quantity for closo-boranes. In all-boron clusters, the absence of B-H bond constraints enables increased electron delocalization and flexibility. The BFE model systematically explains the geometric structures and chemical bonding in boron clusters, revealing variations in electron density that clarify their structural diversity. For borophene, the BFE model predicts that hexagonal vacancy distributions are influenced by bonding entropy, with uniform electron density enhancing stability. Notably, our model predicts borophenes with a vacancy concentration of 1 6 to exhibit increased stability with long-range periodicity. Therefore, the BFE model serves as a practical criterion for structure prediction, providing essential insights into the stability and physical properties of boron-based systems.</description>

      <title>Driving force of atomic ordering in Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$, investigated by density functional theory and machine-learning interatomic potentials Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the mechanisms of atomic ordering in Fe$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$ alloys using density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning interatomic potential Monte Carlo (MLIP-MC) simulations. We clarified that the formation enthalpy of the ordered phase was significantly enhanced by spin polarization compared to that of the disordered phase. Analysis of the density of states indicated that coherence in local potentials in the ordered phase brings energy gain over the disordered phases, when spin is considered. MLIP-MC simulations were performed to investigate the phase transition of atomic ordering at a finite temperature. The model trained using the DFT dataset with spin polarization exhibited quantitatively good agreement with previous experiments and thermodynamic calculations across a wide range of Pt compositions, whereas the model without spin significantly underestimated the transition temperature. Through this study, we clarified that spin polarization is essential for accurately accounting for the ordered phase in Fe-Pt bimetallic alloys, even above the Curie temperature, possibly because of the remaining short-range spin order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anharmonic Effects on the Superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S at High Pressures: a First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of first-principles calculations we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S, one of the lowest enthalpy structures in the C-S-H system, in the 150-300 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a correction to the crystal structure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon spectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have an impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice, pushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely affected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is dynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at which the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a consequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the electron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even more at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature is overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in the whole pressure range studied. Our results underline that ternary hydrides are subject to strong anharmonic effects on their structural, vibrational, and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved Nuclear Resonance Scattering under X-ray standing wave -an approach to study interface magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotope selective grazing-incidence nuclear resonance scattering (GI-NRS) technique is demonstrated to be depth-resolved under x-ray standing wave (XSW) conditions to probe the magnetism of the two interfaces of the Fe layers (Fe-on-Tb and Tb-on-Fe interface) independently in Tb/Fe/Tb trilayer structures. Depth resolution was achieved by placing an ultra-thin layer of 57Fe at both interfaces (Tb/57Fe/Fe/57FeTb). Intentionally, both 57Fe layers were assumed to have different hyperfine fields and orientations. Based on theoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that the antinode regions of XSWs generated through the W/Si multilayer structure allow one to independently measure the Fe-on-Tb and Tb-on-Fe interface at different incident angles. These theoretical simulations of NRS patterns at different incident angles correspond to 57Fe layers independently in the Tb/Fe/Tb trilayer. The present work shows the capability of combining XSW and GI-NRS to study buried magnetic interfaces in thin film structures.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 2D Materials via Symmetry-Constrained Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in accelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of these materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However, existing generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints, which limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here, we introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates space group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff positions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the generation of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to evaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural relaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy stability criteria (Ehull &lt; 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six candidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band structure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which exhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a symmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure prediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints enhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to the discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Linear Enhancement of Spin-Orbit Torques and Absence of Bulk Rashba-Type Spin Splitting in Perpendicularly Magnetized [Pt/Co/W]n Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of magnetic heterostructures with strong spin-orbit torques (SOTs), low impedance, strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and good integration compatibility at the same time is central for high-performance spintronic memory and computing applications. Here, we report the development of the symmetry-broken spin-orbit superlattice [Pt/Co/W]n that can be sputtered-deposited on commercial oxidized silicon substrates and have giant SOTs, strong uniaxial PMA of 9.2 Merg/cm3. The dampinglike and fieldlike SOTs of the [Pt/Co/W]n superlattices exhibit a linear increase with the repeat number n and reach the giant values of 225% and -33% (two orders of magnitude greater than that in clean-limit Pt) at n = 12, respectively. The dampinglike SOT is also of the opposite sign and much greater in magnitude than the fieldlike SOT, regardless of the number of n. These results clarify that the spin current that generates SOTs in the [Pt/Co/W]n superlattices arises predominantly from the spin Hall effect rather than bulk Rashba-type spin splitting, providing a unified understanding of the SOTs in the superlattices. We also demonstrate deterministic switching in thicker-than-50-nm PMA [Pt/Co/W]12 superlattices at a low current density. This work establishes the [Pt/Co/W]n superlattice as a compelling material candidate for ultra-fast, low-power, long-retention nonvolatile spintronic memory and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Elastic Constants and Bending Rigidities from Long-Wavelength Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical and elastic properties of materials are among the most fundamental quantities for many engineering and industrial applications. Here, we present a formulation that is efficient and accurate for calculating the elastic and bending rigidity tensors of crystalline solids, leveraging interatomic force constants and long-wavelength perturbation theory. Crucially, in the long-wavelength limit, lattice vibrations induce macroscopic electric fields which further couple with the propagation of elastic waves, and a separate treatment on the long-range electrostatic interactions is thereby required to obtain elastic properties under the appropriate electrical boundary conditions. A cluster expansion of the charge density response and dielectric screening function in the long-wavelength limit has been developed to efficiently extract multipole and dielectric tensors of arbitrarily high order. We implement the proposed method in a first-principles framework and perform extensive validations on silicon, NaCl, GaAs and rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ as well as monolayer graphene, hexagonal BN, MoS$_2$ and InSe, obtaining good to excellent agreement with other theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. Notably, we establish that multipolar interactions up to at least octupoles are necessary to obtain the accurate short-circuit elastic tensor of bulk materials, while higher orders beyond octupole interactions are required to converge the bending rigidity tensor of 2D crystals. The present approach greatly simplifies the calculations of bending rigidities and will enable the automated characterization of the mechanical properties of novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Advancing Surface Chemistry with Large-Scale Ab-Initio Quantum Many-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Wetting-Layer-Assisted Synthesis of Inverted CdSe/PbSe Quantum Dots and their Photophysical and Photo-Electrical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructured quantum dots (QDs) based on narrow-gap PbSe and wide-gap CdSe have been studied with an eye on their prospective applications in near-infrared (NIR) light sources, photodetectors, and solar cells. The most common structural motif is a spherical QD comprising a PbSe core enclosed into a CdSe shell. However, the potential barrier created by the CdSe shell complicates extraction of band-edge charge carriers from the QD. Therefore, conventional PbSe/CdSe QDs are not suitable for applications in practical photoconversion devices. Here we report inverted CdSe/PbSe core/shell QDs that overcome this drawback. In these structures, both photocarriers (electron and hole) exhibit a significant degree of shell localization and are therefore free to move within the QD solid and be extracted into an external circuit. To create such QDs, we employ a novel synthetic method in which a thin, atomically controlled wetting layer is used to homogenize the surface of the CdSe core and thus promote directionally uniform growth of the PbSe shell. Unlike noninverted QDs, inverted core/shell structures exhibit highly efficient photocarrier transport, making them excellent candidates for applications in practical photoconversion including photovoltaics, photodetection, and photochemistry.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. By using this classification, we theoretically model a double-junction transport device that shows enhanced interaction with NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. This may be attributed to macroscopic effects, like increased porosity, or even to modifications at the chemical bond scale. We have performed high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the elastic compressibility properties on this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, on three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite, relative to terrestrial olivine. The origin of the observed differences may be the consequence of a combination of factors reflecting their complex history. The combined study by nanoindentations and HP-XRD of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue to characterize these materials that will be crucial for future extraterrestrial resource utilization purposes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological defects and spin liquid in a two-orbital spin-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing exotic quantum phases of matter, e.g. spin liquid, is an attractive topic in condensed matter. Here, by a Monte Carlo study of a two-orbital spin-fermion model on a honeycomb lattice, we show the cooperative effects of the orbital degeneracy of itinerant electrons and the exchange interaction of localized spins can significantly suppress both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders by generating topological defects and give rise to an intermediate spin liquid state via continuous phase transitions. This phase competition can also be achieved by tuning the electron filling. These results shed new light on realizing spin liquids on geometrically non-frustrated lattices.</description>

      <title>Competing electronic ground states in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is rare among superconductors, in that magnetic field tunes it between two distinct superconducting phases. Combined with a lack of local inversion symmetry and an upper critical field exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit, this excitingly suggests triplet multicomponent superconductivity. Preceding the superconducting onset, f-electron correlations cause long-range order, attributed both to local antiferromagnetism and itinerant (quadrupole) density-waves. Magnetic field provides a significant perturbation of the f-electron and may reveal the nature of the many-body correlations. Thus, we report comprehensive magnetization and magnetotransport studies on microstructured devices in fields of up to 73 T. Applied along the c-axis, field causes a low-temperature valence transition at {\mu}0H ~ 24 T. By contrast, in-plane fields produce a cascade of phase transitions; the field-induced in-plane conductivity anisotropy and lack of accompanying magnetic features, plus the closed-dome nature of the overall phase boundary is consistent with a hierarchy of field-induced density-wave states.</description>

      <title>Origin of the insulating and superconducting phases in molecular solid $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of organic molecular solids are highlighted by their complex phase diagram and light-induced phenomena, such as Mott insulator, spin liquid phase, and superconductivity. However, a discrepancy between experimental observation and first-principle calculation on the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X family inhibits understanding their properties. Here, we revisit the electronic structure of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ with the recently developed DFT+GOU method to correct the energy level of molecular orbital states in the molecular solid. Our work reveals that the insulating electronic structure of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ originates from the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital states of the BEDT-TTF dimers, that are the periodic unit of the molecular solid. We verify that our calculation result provides consistent band gap, optical conductivity, and evolution of the metal-insulator transition as a function of pressure with experimental observations. Especially, the superconducting dome of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, which originates from the flat band state at the Fermi level, is reproduced. Additionally, we constructed a new low-energy lattice model based on the ability of electronic structure data that can be used to address many-body physics, such as quantum spin liquid and double-holon dynamics. Our provides a deeper understanding of the complex phase diagram and various light-induced phenomena in the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X family and the other complex organic molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of an active wheel rolling in circles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrated granular matter constitutes a useful system for studying the physics of active matter. Usually, self-propulsion is induced in grains through suitable asymmetry in the particle design. In this paper, we show that a symmetrical mini wheel placed on a vibrating plate self-propels along circular trajectories, showing chiral active dynamics. The chiral activity emerges through a sequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the particle's kinetics. The fact that isotropy, fore-aft, and chiral symmetries are broken spontaneously leads to distinct statistics, which include a temporal evolution involving stochastic resetting, a non-Gaussian velocity distribution with multiple peaks, broad power-law curvature distribution, and a bounded chirality probability, along with a phase transition from passive achiral to active chiral state as a function of vibration amplitude. Our study establishes the vibrated wheel as a three-state chiral active system that can serve as a model experimental system to study the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of chiral active systems and can inspire novel locomotion strategies in robotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Here, we report the experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current polarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the magnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the altermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a conventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing luxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with unconventional spin degeneracy lifting.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-temperature heat transport evidence for residual density of states in the superconducting state of CsV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The V-based kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) host charge density wave (CDW) and a topological nontrivial band structure, thereby provide a great platform to study the interplay of superconductivity (SC), CDW, frustration, and topology. Here, we report ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and Ta-doped Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The finite residual linear term of thermal conductivity at zero magnetic field suggests the existence of a residual density of states (DOS) in the superconducting state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This is supported by the observation of non-zero conductance at zero bias in STM spectrum at an electronic temperature of 90 mK. However, in Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, which does not have CDW order, there is no evidence for residual DOS. These results show the importance of CDW order for the residual DOS, and a nodal $s$-wave gap or residual Fermi arc may be the origin of the residual DOS in such an unusual multiband kagome superconductor, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

Abstract: Bound states and scattering resonances in the unoccupied continuum of a two-dimensional crystal predicted in [Phys.Rev. B 87, 041405(R) (2013)] are considered within an exactly solvable model. A close connection of the observed resonances with those arising in the Fano theory is revealed. The resonance occurs when the lateral scattering couples the layer-perpendicular incident electron wave to a strictly bound state. The coupling strength determines the location of the pole in the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane, which is analytically shown to lead to a characteristic Fano-lineshape of the energy dependence of the electron transmissivity through the crystal. The implications for the timing of the resonance scattering are discussed. The analytical results are illustrated by ab initio calculations for a graphene monolayer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is difficult to intuit how electronic structure features$-$such as band gap magnitude, location of band extrema, effective masses, etc.$-$arise from the underlying crystal chemistry of a material. Here we present a strategy to distill sparse and chemically-interpretable tight-binding models from density functional theory calculations, enabling us to interpret how multiple orbital interactions in a 3D crystal conspire to shape the overall band structure. Applying this process to silicon, we show that its indirect gap arises from a competition between first and second nearest-neighbor bonds$-$where second nearest-neighbor interactions pull the conduction band down from $\Gamma$ to $X$ in a cosine shape, but the first nearest-neighbor bonds push the band up near $X$, resulting in the characteristic dip of the silicon conduction band. By identifying the essential orbital interactions that shape the conduction band, we can further rationally tune bond strengths to morph the silicon band structure into the germanium band structure. Our computational approach serves as a general framework to extract the crystal chemistry origins of electronic structure features from density functional theory calculations, enabling a new paradigm of bonding-by-design.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

Abstract: Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
