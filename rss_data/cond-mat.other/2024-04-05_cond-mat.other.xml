      <title>Superclimbing modes in transverse quantum fluids: signature statistical and dynamical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superclimbing modes are hallmark degrees of freedom of transverse quantum fluids describing wide superfluid one-dimensional interfaces and/or edges with negligible Peierls barrier. We report the first direct numeric evidence of quantum shape fluctuations -- caused by superclimbing modes -- in simple lattice models, as well as at the free edge of an incomplete solid monolayer of $^4$He adsorbed on graphite. Our data unambiguously reveals the defining feature of the superclimbing modes -- canonical conjugation of the edge displacement field to the field of superfluid phase -- and its unexpected implication, i.e., that superfluid stiffness can be inferred from density snapshots.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Quenches for Efficient Critical Ground State Preparation in Two-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators have the potential to shed light on the study of quantum many-body systems and materials, offering unique insights into various quantum phenomena. While adiabatic evolution has been conventionally employed for state preparation, it faces challenges when the system evolves too quickly or the coherence time is limited. In such cases, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as spatiotemporal quenches, provide a promising alternative. This paper numerically investigates the application of spatiotemporal quenches in the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model with ferromagnetic interactions, focusing on the emergence of the ground state and its correlation properties at criticality when the gap vanishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these quenches in rapidly preparing ground states in critical systems. Our simulations reveal the existence of an optimal quench front velocity at the emergent speed of light, leading to minimal excitation energy density and correlation lengths of the order of finite system sizes we can simulate. These findings emphasize the potential of spatiotemporal quenches for efficient ground state preparation in quantum systems, with implications for the exploration of strongly correlated phases and programmable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Damping Reveals Hidden Dimensions in Elastic Metastructures Through Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Damping typically results in attenuation of vibrations and elastic wave propagation in mechanical systems. Contrary to this conventional understanding, we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically the revival of an elastic wave transmitted through a periodic metastructure when a weak non-Hermitian defect (damping mechanism) induces violation of time-reversal symmetry. Damping alters the nature of the system's resonant modes, instigating interference in the scattering field. This leads to transmission revival, revealing the presence of hidden modes which are otherwise masked by the symmetry. Our findings offer an innovative approach for designing dissipation-driven switches and controllers and non-destructive structural health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting virtual photons in ultrastrongly coupled superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction and understanding the fundamental physics behind is essential for emerging quantum technologies. Solid-state devices may explore new regimes where coupling strengths are "ultrastrong", i.e., comparable to the energies of the subsystems. New exotic phenomena occur the common root of many of them being the fact that the entangled vacuum contains virtual photons. They herald the lack of conservation of the number of excitations which is the witness of ultrastrong coupling breaking the U(1) symmetry. Despite more than a decade of research, the detection of ground-state virtual photons still awaits demonstration. In this work, we recognize the "conspiring" set of experimental challenges and show how to overcome them, thus providing a solution to this long-standing problem. We find that combining a superinductor-based unconventional "light fluxonium" qudit and coherent control yields a highly efficient, faithful, and selective conversion of virtual photons into real ones. This enables their detection with resources available to present-day quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Integrated conversion and photodetection of virtual photons in an ultrastrongly coupled superconducting quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground-state of an artificial atom ultrastrongly coupled to quantized modes is entangled and contains an arbitrary number of virtual photons. The problem of their detection has been raised since the very birth of the field but despite the theoretical efforts still awaits experimental demonstration. Recently experimental problems have been addressed in detail showing that they can be overcome by combining an unconventional design of the artificial atom with advanced coherent control. In this work we study a simple scheme of control-integrated continuous measurement which makes remarkably favourable the tradeoff between measurement efficiency and backaction showing that the unambiguous detection of virtual photons can be achieved within state-of-the art quantum technologies.</description>
