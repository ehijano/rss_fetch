      <title>Quantifying Collective Emotions: Japan's Societal Trends Through Enhanced Sentiment Index Using POMS2 and SNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we constructed an emotion index that quantitatively represents the collective emotions present in the Japanese web space by utilizing Social Networking Service (SNS) post data. Building upon previous research that used blog data and the Profile of Mood States (POMS), we restructured the methodology using posts from X (formerly Twitter) and updated the model by adding the ``Friendliness" indicator from the POMS2 metrics. Through periodic and trend analyses of the emotional indicators derived from X's post data, we found that the extension is consistent with results previously reported using blog data. This suggests that our methodology effectively captures typical emotional fluctuations in Japanese society, independent of specific SNS platforms, and is expected to serve as an index to visualize societal trends.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Decoupled Message Passing Experts with Entropy Constraint for General Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The varying degrees of homophily and heterophily in real-world graphs persistently constrain the universality of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification. Adopting a data-centric perspective, this work reveals an inherent preference of different graphs towards distinct message encoding schemes: homophilous graphs favor local propagation, while heterophilous graphs exhibit preference for flexible combinations of propagation and transformation. To address this, we propose GNNMoE, a universal node classification framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. The framework first constructs diverse message-passing experts through recombination of fine-grained encoding operators, then designs soft and hard gating layers to allocate the most suitable expert networks for each node's representation learning, thereby enhancing both model expressiveness and adaptability to diverse graphs. Furthermore, considering that soft gating might introduce encoding noise in homophilous scenarios, we introduce an entropy constraint to guide sharpening of soft gates, achieving organic integration of weighted combination and Top-K selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNNMoE significantly outperforms mainstream GNNs, heterophilous GNNs, and graph transformers in both node classification performance and universality across diverse graph datasets.</description>

      <title>ChorusCVR: Chorus Supervision for Entire Space Post-Click Conversion Rate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation is a vital task in many recommender systems of revenue businesses, e.g., e-commerce and advertising. In a perspective of sample, a typical CVR positive sample usually goes through a funnel of exposure to click to conversion. For lack of post-event labels for un-clicked samples, CVR learning task commonly only utilizes clicked samples, rather than all exposed samples as for click-through rate (CTR) learning task. However, during online inference, CVR and CTR are estimated on the same assumed exposure space, which leads to a inconsistency of sample space between training and inference, i.e., sample selection bias (SSB). To alleviate SSB, previous wisdom proposes to design novel auxiliary tasks to enable the CVR learning on un-click training samples, such as CTCVR and counterfactual CVR, etc. Although alleviating SSB to some extent, none of them pay attention to the discrimination between ambiguous negative samples (un-clicked) and factual negative samples (clicked but un-converted) during modelling, which makes CVR model lacks robustness. To full this gap, we propose a novel ChorusCVR model to realize debiased CVR learning in entire-space.</description>

      <title>An Axiom System for Feedback Centralities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the axiomatic approach to centrality measures has attracted attention in the literature. However, most papers propose a collection of axioms dedicated to one or two considered centrality measures. In result, it is hard to capture the differences and similarities between various measures. In this paper, we propose an axiom system for four classic feedback centralities: Eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, Katz prestige and PageRank. We prove that each of these four centrality measures can be uniquely characterized with a subset of our axioms. Our system is the first one in the literature that considers all four feedback centralities.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Anchor Embedding for Exact Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgraph matching query is a classic problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications, such as discovering structures in biological or chemical networks, finding communities in social network analysis, explaining neural networks, and so on. To further solve the subgraph matching problem, several recent advanced works attempt to utilize deep-learning-based techniques to handle the subgraph matching query. However, most of these works only obtain approximate results for subgraph matching without theoretical guarantees of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework (GNN-AE), which allows exact subgraph matching. Unlike GNN-based approximate subgraph matching approaches that only produce inexact results, in this paper, we pioneer a series of concepts related to anchor (including anchor, anchor graph/path, etc.) in subgraph matching and carefully devise the anchor (graph) embedding technique based on GNN models. We transform the subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space via the anchor (graph &amp; path) embedding techniques. With the proposed anchor matching mechanism, GNN-AE can guarantee subgraph matching has no false dismissals. We design an efficient matching growth algorithm, which can retrieve the locations of all exact matches in parallel. We also propose a cost-model-based DFS query plan to enhance the parallel matching growth algorithm. Through extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our GNN-AE approach for exact subgraph matching.</description>
