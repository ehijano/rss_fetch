      <title>A cold beam of BaOH molecules using a water-vapour seeded neon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we report on the production and characterization of a cold beam of BaOH molecules using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. BaOH is a highly suitable molecule for studies of the violation of fundamental symmetries, such as the search for the electron's electric dipole moment. BaOH molecules are synthesised inside the cold source through laser ablation of a barium metal target while water vapor is seeded into the neon buffer gas. The BaOH flux is significantly enhanced ($\sim$11 times) when laser-exciting the barium atoms inside the buffer-gas cell on the $^1\mathrm S_0 - ^3\mathrm P_1$ transition. A similar enhancement has been reported for other alkaline-earth(-like) monohydroxides. For typical source conditions, the molecular beam has an average velocity of $\approx180$ m/s and an intensity of $\sim 10^{9}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ in $N=1$, which is comparable to that of cryogenic BaF beams.</description>

      <title>Atomic and molecular systems for radiation thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms and simple molecules are excellent candidates for new standards and sensors because they are both all identical and their properties are determined by the immutable laws of quantum physics. Here, we introduce the concept of building a standard and sensor of radiative temperature using atoms and molecules. Such standards are based on precise measurement of the rate at which blackbody radiation (BBR) either excites or stimulates emission for a given atomic transition. We summarize the recent results of two experiments while detailing the rate equation models required for their interpretation. The cold atom thermometer (CAT) uses a gas of laser cooled $^{85}$Rb Rydberg atoms to probe the BBR spectrum near 130~GHz. This primary, {\it i.e.}, not traceable to a measurement of like kind, temperature measurement currently has a total uncertainty of approximately 1~\%, with clear paths toward improvement. The compact blackbody radiation atomic sensor (CoBRAS) uses a vapour of $^{85}$Rb and monitors fluorescence from states that are either populated by BBR or populated by spontaneous emission to measure the blackbody spectrum near 24.5~THz. The CoBRAS has an excellent relative precision of $u(T)\approx 0.13$~K, with a clear path toward implementing a primary</description>

      <title>Incoherent repumping scheme in the $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ five-level manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-cooled trapped ions are at the heart of modern quantum technologies and their cooling dynamics often deviate from the simplified two-level atom model. Doppler cooling of the $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ ion involves several electronic levels and repumping channels that strongly influence fluorescence.In this work, we study a repumping scheme for the $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ ion by combining precision single-ion spectroscopy with comprehensive numerical modeling based on optical Bloch equations including 18 Zeeman sublevels. We show that, although the observed fluorescence spectra retain a Lorentzian lineshape, their width and amplitude cannot be explained by a two-level atom description. Moreover, we find the optimal repumping conditions for maximizing the photon scattering rate.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Perspective On King Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopic measurements of isotope shifts have recently reached a high level of accuracy. Tests of King non-linearity (NL) along isotope chains have been proposed as a tool to search for fifth-force mediators. At the same time, these tests can potentially teach us about the structure of heavy nuclei at unprecedented precision, where King NL has already been observed in several systems. A robust interpretation of the existing data, however, is hampered by incomplete control over the Standard Model (SM) contributions. We develop a systematic effective field theory framework, matching the SM onto scalar non-relativistic QED in the infinite nuclear mass limit and then onto quantum-mechanical potentials. This approach organizes all nuclear effects into a small set of Wilson coefficients and cleanly separates short- and long-distance physics. We show that the commonly used treatment of the $\langle r^2\rangle^2$ term needs to be reconsidered, as it arises only at second-order in perturbation theory, and we derive the long-range $1/r^4$ potential from nuclear polarizability. Applying the framework to hydrogen-like systems, we provide a transparent classification of SM sources of King NL relevant for current and future isotope-shift experiments. The formalism can be applied to learn about the shape of the heavy scalar nuclei at a higher level of precision and detail than what was previously attainable.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Effects on Atomic Measurements of the Weinberg Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a complete expression for the neutrino-mediated quantum force beyond the four-Fermi approximation within the Standard Model. Using this new result, we study the effect of atomic parity violation caused by neutrinos. We find that the neutrino effect is sizable compared to the current experimental sensitivity and can also significantly affect the value of the Weinberg angle measured in atomic systems. This offers a promising method for detecting the neutrino force in the future and facilitates the application of precision atomic physics as a probe for neutrino physics and the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Topological Berry Phase with a Single Phonon in an Ion Microtrap Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\mu$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.</description>

      <title>Predicting interstitial elements in Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys, composed of multiple principal refractory elements, are promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications due to their exceptional thermal stability and high melting points. However, their mechanical performance is often compromised by interstitial impurities, particularly oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon, which segregate to grain boundaries and promote embrittlement. In this study, we investigate the solubility and thermodynamic behavior of oxygen interstitials in a model NbTiHfTa RCCA system. We synthesized NbTiHfTa alloys with varying oxygen contents via plasma arc melting and characterized their phase evolution and microstructure using XRD, SEM, and TEM. Complementary computational modeling was performed using machine-learning interatomic potentials integrated with Monte Carlo simulations to probe oxygen interactions at the atomic scale. Our results reveal a solubility limit for oxygen between 0.8 and 1.0 atomic percentage, beyond which HfO2 formation is energetically favorable. This combined experimental-computational framework provides a predictive approach for managing interstitial behavior in RCCAs, enabling improved alloy design strategies for enhanced mechanical performance.</description>
