      <title>Free energy of the gas of spin 1/2 fermions beyond the second order and the Stoner phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous work we have developed a systematic thermal (imaginary time) perturbative expansion and applying it to the relevant effective field theory computed, up to the second order in the interaction, the free energy $F$ of the diluted gas of (nonrelativistic) spin $1/2$ fermions interacting through a spin-independent repulsive two-body potential. Here we extend this computations to higher orders: assuming that the only relevant parameter specifying the interaction potential is the $s$-wave scattering length $a_0$, we compute the complete order $(k_{\rm F}a_0)^3$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector) contribution to the system's free energy as a function of the numbers $N_+$ and $N_-$ of spin up and spin down fermions (i.e. as a function of its polarization) and the temperature $T$. We also extend the computation beyond a fixed order by resumming the contributions to $F$ of two infinite sets of Feynman diagrams: the so called particle-particle rings and the particle-hole rings. We find that including the second one of these two contributions has a dramatic consequence for the transition of the system from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase (the so called Stoner phase transition): in this approximation the phase transition simply disappears.</description>

      <title>Effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the superfluid transition in two-dimensional atomic Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper treatment of the many-body interactions is of paramount importance in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating applied potentials in cold atom lattice simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile and highly controllable platform for quantum simulation, capable of realizing a broad family of Hubbard models, and allowing site-resolved readout via quantum gas microscopes. In principle, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented; however, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit, precisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here, we propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to measure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol is the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach resonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we demonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known, easily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the potential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty in the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation with arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>Scattering of a massive quantum vortex-dipole from an obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates, massive-vortex dipoles can arise, and undergo scattering processes against obstacles. These show an intriguing dynamics, governed by the strongly nonlinear character of the quantum vortex motion, where we are able to highlight the effects of the boundaries. We first characterize such scattering dynamics via some point-like models, for the cases of an unbounded plane and a confined geometry. Within this framework, we find two fundamental scattering behaviors of a vortex dipole, the "fly-by" and the "go-around" processes. By plotting the deflection angle of the dipole versus the impact parameter we are able to quantify the transition between different scattering behaviors. We then are able to introduce an analytical distinction of the two scenarios, basing on the point-like model for the plane geometry. Furthermore, another interesting result shows the emergence of an on-average massless dynamics whenever the nonlinear interactions with the obstacle become negligible. Alongside, we investigate the quantum dipole scattering via the numerical simulation of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, describing the quantum mixture at a mean-field level. In this way, we benchmark the point-like model against the mean-field simulations.</description>

      <title>Coupling-induced universal dynamics in bilayer two-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of order in many-body systems and the associated self-similar dynamics governed by dynamical scaling laws is a hallmark of universality far from equilibrium. Measuring and classifying such nontrivial behavior for novel symmetry classes remains challenging. Here, we realize a well-controlled interlayer coupling quench in a tunable bilayer two-dimensional Bose gas, driving the system to an ordered phase. We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Universal decay of (conditional) mutual information in gapped pure- and mixed-state quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Ground and excited potential energy surfaces for CaF+Ca interactions and isotope exchange reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.</description>

      <title>Gaussian tomography for cold-atom simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.</description>

      <title>Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence and phase transitions are studied in a finite one-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model using exact diagonalization under thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and disorder. The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator--superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach for bosons: self-eliminating divergence and pure pair condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation (PA). We predict that the transition temperature shifts to higher values due interactions, with the HFB approach yielding a larger shift than the PA. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to only a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.</description>

      <title>Analytic Phase Solution and Point Vortex Model for Dipolar Quantum Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the phase of a quantum vortex in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, capturing anisotropic effects from long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This solution provides a foundation for a dipolar point vortex model (DPVM), incorporating both phase-driven flow and dipolar forces. The DPVM reproduces key features of vortex pair dynamics seen in full simulations, including anisotropic velocities, deformed orbits, and directional motion, offering a minimal and accurate model for dipolar vortex dynamics. Our results open the door to analytic studies of vortices in dipolar quantum matter and establish a new platform for exploring vortex dynamics and turbulence in these systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</description>

      <title>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring quasiperiodic phases in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent a compelling extension of the concept of time crystals (TCs). While TCs break discrete time-translation symmetry by exhibiting a periodic response at a subharmonic of the driving frequency, TQCs display a more complex temporal order. They respond at multiple incommensurate frequencies, values that are not integer multiples of the fundamental driving frequency, resulting in quasiperiodic dynamics. In this work, we investigate the emergence of a TQC in a disordered quantum Ising chain subjected to a quasiperiodic transverse field. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the transverse magnetization exhibits quasiperiodic oscillations which persist over extended prethermal timescales before eventual decay. This indicates that the TQC exists as a long-lived, prethermal dynamical phase rather than a true equilibrium state. We further assess the robustness of this prethermal TQC against interactions and driving imperfections, confirming its stability under realistic experimental conditions. Finite-size analysis reveals that the prethermal TQC lifetime exhibits minimal dependence on system size. Additionally, we explore the emergence of TQCs in the same chain under symmetric sampling of exchange couplings. Our results demonstrate that the TQC phase is highly sensitive to both the choice of coupling distribution and the values of the driving frequencies. These findings highlight promising experimental prospects for realizing TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, providing valuable insights into their stability, dynamical properties, and potential for exploring novel non-equilibrium quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>
