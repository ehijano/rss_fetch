      <title>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</description>

      <title>Examining the Impact of Local Condition Violations on Energy Computations in DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Extent of Violation Indices (EVIs), a novel metric for quantifying how well exchange-correlation functionals adhere to local conditions. Applying EVIs to a diverse set of molecules for GGA functionals reveals widespread violations, particularly for semi-empirical functionals. We leverage EVIs to explore potential connections between these violations and errors in chemical properties. While no correlation is observed for atomization energies, a link emerges between EVIs and total energies. Similarly, the analysis of reaction energies suggests weak positive correlations for specific conditions, but definitive conclusions about error cancellation require advancements in both functional accuracy and our understanding of cancellation mechanisms. Overall, this study highlights EVIs as a powerful tool for analyzing functional behavior and adherence to local conditions, paving the way for future research to fully elucidate the impact of violations on energy errors.</description>

      <title>Effect of Substitution Group on Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond of Amino Alcohols from Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the simultaneous presence of two polar functional groups and flexible spatial structure, Aminoethanol (AE) is a model system for investigating the relationship between intramolecular hydrogen bonding and conformational equlibrium. In addition, Aminoethanol and their derivatives exhibit remarkable efficacy in the reversible capture of carbon dioxide. The intramoleculr hydrogen bond of 2-AE is determined by a subtle balance between electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals interactions, and steric effects. Changing the polarity of functional groups can regulate the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. In this work, using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we investigated the effect of N-terminated substitution group on intramolecular hydrogen bond. When the H atom of NH2 functional group is replaced by electron-donating groups such as methyl and ethyl, it was observed experimentally that the red-shift of OH stretching vibration frequency caused by O-H... N intramolecular hydrogen bonding increases significantly and then the corresponding peak intensity increases. This indicates that with the introduction of substitutions on the N atom, the O-H... N intramolecular hydrogen bond in 2-AE is enhanced and the corresponding conformational population increases. The results of AIM and NCI analysis are consistent with experimental observations. These results provide insights for regulating the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and also contribute to the strategy of CO2 capture.</description>

      <title>Current density functional framework for spin-orbit coupling: Extension to periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling induces a current density in the ground state, which consequently requires a generalization for meta-generalized gradient approximations. That is, the exchange-correlation energy has to be constructed as an explicit functional of the current density and a generalized kinetic energy density has to be formed to satisfy theoretical constraints. Herein, we generalize our previously presented formalism of spin-orbit current density functional theory [Holzer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 204102 (2022)] to non-magnetic and magnetic periodic systems of arbitrary dimension. Besides the ground-state exchange-correlation potential, analytical derivatives such as geometry gradients and stress tensors are implemented. The importance of the current density is assessed for band gaps, lattice constants, magnetic transitions, and Rashba splittings. For the latter, the impact of the current density may be larger than the deviation between different density functional approximations.</description>

      <title>CO2 capture using boron, nitrogen, and phosphorus-doped C20 in the present electric field: A DFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burning fossil fuels emits a significant amount of CO2, causing climate change concerns. CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to reduce emissions, with fullerenes showing promise as CO2 adsorbents. Recent research focuses on modifying fullerenes using an electric field. In light of this, we carried out DFT studies on some B, N, and P doped C20 (C20-nXn (n = 0, 1, 2, and 3; X = B, N, and P)) in the absence and presence of an electric field in the range of 0-0.02 a.u.. The cohesive energy was calculated to ensure their thermodynamic stability showing, that despite having lesser cohesive energies than C20, they appear in a favorable range. Moreover, the charge distribution for all structures was depicted using the ESP map. Most importantly, we evaluated the adsorption energy, height, and CO2 angle, demonstrating the B and N-doped fullerenes had the stronger interaction with CO2, which by far exceeded C20's, improving its physisorption to physicochemical adsorption. Although the adsorption energy of P-doped fullerenes was not as satisfactory, in most cases, increasing the electric field led to enhancing CO2 adsorption and incorporating chemical attributes to CO2-fullerene interaction. The HOMO--LUMO plots were obtained by which we discovered that unlike the P-doped C20, the surprising activity of B and N-doped C20s against CO2 originates from a high concentration of the HOMO-LUMO orbitals on B and N atoms. Additionally, the charge distribution for all structures was depicted using the ESP map. In the present article, we attempt to introduce more effective fullerene-based materials for CO2 capture as well as strategies to enhance their efficiency and revealing adsorption nature over B, N, and P-doped fullerenes.</description>

      <title>Assessing exchange-correlation functionals for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing interest in sustainable synthesis of ammonia, nitrates, and urea has led to an increase in studies of catalytic conversion between nitrogen-containing compounds using heterogeneous catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly employed to obtain molecular-scale insight into these reactions, but there have been relatively few assessments of the exchange-correlation functionals that are best suited for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen compounds. Here, we assess a range of functionals ranging from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the random phase approximation (RPA) for the formation energies of gas-phase nitrogen species, the lattice constants of representative solids from several common classes of catalysts (metals, oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), and the adsorption energies of a range of nitrogen-containing intermediates on these materials. The results reveal that the choice of exchange-correlation functional and van der Waals correction can have a surprisingly large effect and that increasing the level of theory does not always improve the accuracy for nitrogen-containing compounds. This suggests that the selection of functionals should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the specific reaction and material being studied.</description>

      <title>QH9: A Quantum Hamiltonian Prediction Benchmark for QM9 Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning approaches have been increasingly used in accelerating electronic structure prediction as surrogates of first-principle computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT). While numerous quantum chemistry datasets focus on chemical properties and atomic forces, the ability to achieve accurate and efficient prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix is highly desired, as it is the most important and fundamental physical quantity that determines the quantum states of physical systems and chemical properties. In this work, we generate a new Quantum Hamiltonian dataset, named as QH9, to provide precise Hamiltonian matrices for 999 or 2998 molecular dynamics trajectories and 130,831 stable molecular geometries, based on the QM9 dataset. By designing benchmark tasks with various molecules, we show that current machine learning models have the capacity to predict Hamiltonian matrices for arbitrary molecules. Both the QH9 dataset and the baseline models are provided to the community through an open-source benchmark, which can be highly valuable for developing machine learning methods and accelerating molecular and materials design for scientific and technological applications. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenDFT/QHBench.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) enabling the prediction of energy differences, and guessed an Ansatz to parametrize space $\pmb{r}$ in some alchemical change $\lambda$. We present a rigorous derivation of AIT's kernel $\mathcal{K}$ and a rigorous $\pmb{r}(\lambda)$ in $n$ dimensions as long as the target's Hamiltonian can be obtained by an affine transformation of the coordinates from the reference Hamiltonian. Analytical expressions for changes in energy spectra and densities are obtained for quantum harmonic oscillator, monomial potentials in $n$ dimensions, and the hydrogen-like atom.</description>

Abstract: We investigate ultrafast vibronic dynamics triggered by intense femtosecond infrared pulses in small molecules. Our study is based on numerical simulations performed with 2D model molecules, and analyzed in the perspective of the renown Lochfrass and Bond-Softening models. We give a new interpretation of the observed nuclear wave packet dynamics, with a focus on the phase of the bond oscillations. Our simulations also reveal intricate features in the field-induced nuclear motion that are not accounted for by existing models. Our analyses assign these features to strong dynamic correlations between the active electron and the nuclei, which significantly depend on the carrier envelope phase of the pulse, even for relatively ``long'' pulses, which should make them experimentally observable.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Methods for Multi-Block Optimization Problems over Transport Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes, which underlie various applications including strongly correlated quantum physics and machine learning. Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent electron transfer and energy dissipation in condensed media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a moving adsorbate interacting with a metal electrode immersed in a solvent using the time-dependent Newns-Anderson-Schmickler model Hamiltonian. We have adopted a semiclassical trajectory treatment of the adsorbate to discuss the electron and energy transfers that occur between the adsorbate and the electrode. Using the Keldysh Green's function scheme, we found a non-adiabatically suppressed electron transfer caused by the motion of the adsorbate and coupling with bath phonons that model the solvent. The energy is thus dissipated into electron-hole pair excitations, which are hindered by interacting with the solvent modes and facilitated by the applied electrode potential. The average energy transfer rate was discussed in terms of the electron friction coefficient and given an analytical expression in the slow-motion limit.</description>

      <title>Bexcitonics: Quasi-particle approach to open quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features. Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons. The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM dynamics.</description>
