      <title>Infinite multiverses and where to find them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Have you ever watched superhero movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? Or played games where your choices create different outcomes? What if we told you that in the real world, something even crazier might be happening all the time, right under our noses? Imagine shrinking down to the size of an atom. What you'd see wouldn't be like our everyday world at all! This is the realm of quantum physics, where the rules we know do not apply, where things exist everywhere and nowhere at once. The moment you observe something, it starts behaving differently. In this article, we will explore two of the many possible explanations for such phenomena, namely the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics. We will also try to answer the question of whether there are many copies of you roaming around in different universes, and why you haven't met one.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to Quantum Aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics occupies a central position in contemporary science while remaining largely inaccessible to direct sensory experience. This paper proposes a roadmap to quantum aesthetics that examines how quantum concepts become aesthetic phenomena through artistic mediation rather than direct representation. Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term "quantum," generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schr\"odinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.</description>

      <title>Imagining the Alien: Human Projections and Cognitive Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.</description>

      <title>The Great Filter hypothesis -- a new Great Filter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Great Filter hypothesis is an extension of the Fermi Paradox: "If life is so common in the universe, why don't we see it?" The Great Filter theory posits there are multiple obstacles or filters life must pass through which ultimately sifts out intelligent life. This paper identifies a new filter: depopulation. As an exospecies advances and reaches the top of the food chain on its planet, Darwinian evolution selects the species to breed fewer offspring due to a lack of predation. As the species evolves intelligence, this leads to medicines and most notably contraception, enabling the species to reduce infant mortality while controlling reproduction. Finally, economic, social and educational factors add to the conscious decision of the intelligent life to slow reproduction. These factors are currently contributing to a human global population peak mid century with subsequent population collapse in less than 500 years. Noting that population growth and decline is exponential, our modelling forecasts human extinction thresholds being tested sometime after the year 2500. There is no reason to assume depopulation dynamics (exodepopulation) would not apply to exocivilizations (exodemography), thus providing a possible resolution of the Fermi Paradox. Furthermore, as machines and AI inevitably supplement humans as depopulation accelerates, the Fermi Paradox can be restated as "Why don't we see machines and AI colonising the galaxy?" A plausible answer is machines will not become conscious and will continue to operate only as tools, tools that will cease operating once humanity is extinct. The Fermi Paradox can then be restated as "Machines will not become conscious, otherwise we would see them colonising the galaxy".</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sovereignty on Mars: Lessons from the International Telecommunication Union and Universal Postal Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humans make ambitious efforts toward long-duration activities beyond Earth, new challenges will continue to emerge that highlight the need for governance frameworks capable of managing shared resources and technical standards in order to sustain human life in these hostile environments. Earth-based governance models of cooperative sovereignty can inform governance mechanisms for future Mars settlements, particularly regarding inter-settlement relations and the technical coordination required for multiple independent settlements to coexist. This study analyzes the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Universal Postal Union (UPU), two of the oldest international organizations, which have successfully established evolving standards across sovereign nations. This analysis of the development and governance structures of these two organizations, and how they resolved key sovereignty issues, reveals principles that could be applicable to future settlements beyond Earth, particularly on Mars. Key insights include the strategic necessity of institutional neutrality, the management of asymmetric power relations, and the governance of shared resources under conditions of mutual vulnerability. The study distinguishes between a "Survival Layer" of technical standards essential for immediate safety and an "Operational Layer" governing economic and political activities, suggesting different governance approaches for each. Although some of these examples of cooperative sovereignty on Earth might not be sufficient for Mars due to its unique environment, lessons from the ITU and UPU case studies offer valuable strategies for designing flexible and sustainable governance models that can function from inception through explicit Earth-based coordination.</description>

      <title>AI-based Verbal and Visual Scaffolding in a Serious Game: Effects on Learning and Cognitive Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further opened the door to new forms of personalized scaffolding in education. In this study, we combine both worlds and study three types of AI-based scaffolding designs in a serious game: (i) no scaffolding, (ii) chat-based (verbal) scaffolding provided by an AI-based non-player character (NPC), and (iii) combined chat-(verbal) and action-based (visual) scaffolding in which the AI may both try to explain or demonstrate the next step towards a solution. The scaffolding conditions are embedded in Qookies, a serious game designed to introduce fundamental concepts of quantum technologies. A total of 152 school students, university students, and members of the general public were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that all groups experience significant learning gains, confirming the overall effectiveness of the serious game itself. No significant differences in learning outcomes emerged between scaffolding conditions. However, intrinsic cognitive load was lower in the combined chat-and-action (verbal+visual) scaffolding condition compared to the chat (verbal)-only condition, suggesting that visual demonstrations may offer more accessible support. Interaction analyses further revealed that players engaged with the AI character primarily for level-related questions and action recommendations, while deeper interactions were relatively rare.</description>
