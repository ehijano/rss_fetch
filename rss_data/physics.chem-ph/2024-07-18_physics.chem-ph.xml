      <title>Theoretical study of the influence of the photosynthetic membrane on B800-B850 energy transfer within the peripheral light-harvesting complex LH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthetic organisms rely on a network of light-harvesting protein-pigment complexes to efficiently absorb sunlight and transfer excitation energy to reaction center proteins for charge separation. In photosynthetic purple bacteria, these complexes are embedded in the cell membrane, where lipid composition affects their clustering and inter-complex energy transfer. However, the lipid bilayer's impact on intra-complex excitation dynamics is less understood. Recent experiments compared photo-excitation dynamics in detergent-isolated light harvesting complex 2 (LH2) to LH2 embedded in membrane discs mimicking the biological environment, revealing differences in spectra and intra-complex energy transfer rates. We use available quantum chemical and spectroscopy data to develop a complementary theoretical study on the excitonic structure and intra-complex energy transfer kinetics of the LH2 from photosynthetic purple bacteria Rhodoblastus acidophilus in two conditions: LH2 in a membrane environment and detergent-isolated LH2. Dark excitonic states crucial for B800-B850 energy transfer within LH2 are found to be more delocalised in the membrane model. Using non-perturbative and generalised F\"orster calculations, it is shown that the increased quantum delocalisation leads to a B800 to B850 transfer rate 30% faster than in the detergent-isolated complex, consistent with experimental results. We identify the main energy transfer pathways in each environment and show how differences in the B800 to B850 transfer rate stem from changes in LH2's electronic properties when embedded in the membrane. By considering quasi-static variations of electronic excitation energies in LH2, we show that the broadening of the B800 to B850 transfer rate distribution is affected by lipid composition. We argue that the variation in broadening could indicate a speed-accuracy trade-off, common in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Gelling Systems in Nonlinear Shear Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study model near-critical polymer gelling systems made of gluten proteins dispersions stabilized at different distances from the gel point. We impose different shear rates and follow the time evolution of the stress. For sufficiently large shear rates, an intermediate stress overshoot is measured before reaching the steady state. We evidence self-similarity of the stress overshoot as a function of the applied shear rate for samples with various distances from the gel point, which is related to the elastic energy stored by the samples, as for dense systems close to the jamming transition. In concordance with the findings for glassy and jammed systems, we also measure that the stress after flow cessation decreases as a power law with time with a characteristic relaxation time that depends on the shear rate previously imposed. These features revealed in non-linear rheology could be the signature of a mesoscopic dynamics, which would depend on the extent of gelation.</description>

      <title>Delicate Analysis of Interacting Proteins and Their Assemblies by Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the efficiency of several Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4) techniques to investigate the self-associating wheat gluten proteins. We compare the use of a denaturing buffer including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and a mild chaotropic solvent, water/ethanol, as eluent, on a model gluten sample. Through a thorough analysis of the data obtained from coupled light scattering detectors, and with the identification of molecular composition of the eluted protein, we evidence co-elution events in several conditions. We show that the focus step used in conventional AF4 with the SDS buffer leads to the formation of aggregates that co-elute with monomeric proteins. By contrast, a frit-inlet device enables the fractionation of individual wheat proteins in the SDS buffer. Interestingly conventional AF4, using water/ethanol as eluent, is an effective method for fractionating gluten proteins and their complex dynamic assemblies which involve weak forces and are composed of both monomeric and polymeric proteins.</description>

      <title>Efficient ensemble uncertainty estimation in Gaussian Processes Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty measures are required when using data based machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for atomistic simulations. In this work, we propose for sparse Gaussian Process Regression type MLIP a stochastic uncertainty measure akin to the query-by-committee approach often used in conjunction with neural network based MLIPs. The uncertainty measure is coined \textit{"label noise"} ensemble uncertainty as it emerges from adding noise to the energy labels in the training data. We find that this method of calculating an ensemble uncertainty is as well calibrated as the one obtained from the closed-form expression for the posterior variance when the sparse GPR is treated as a projected process. Comparing the two methods, our proposed ensemble uncertainty is, however, faster to evaluate than the closed-form expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty measure acts better to support a Bayesian search for optimal structure of Au$_{20}$ clusters.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping. In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. We end by comparing our results for the mobility and optical conductivity to those of the widely used relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. We find that this approximation generally underestimates the charge mobility when compared with our method, which is parameter free and directly simulates the thermal equilibrium diffusion of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons.</description>

      <title>Combining complex conjugation, time-reversal, and spin symmetry projection of coupled cluster wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex conjugation symmetry breaking and restoration generate two non-orthogonal configurations at the Hartree-Fock level that can capture static correlation naturally. In conjunction with broken spin-symmetry coupled cluster theory, the symmetry-projected wave function shows good agreement with full configuration interaction in beryllium hydride insertion, lithium fluoride dissociation, and symmetric stretching of tetrahedral H$_4$. By adding spin flip projection, we can also recover time reversal symmetry in the same coupled cluster framework.</description>
