      <title>Stellar physics at sub-nanoradian angular resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stars -- if they could be imaged with enough angular resolution -- would exhibit features expected from theory but not possible to extract from spectra. We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.
  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\simeq 0.2\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf. In this White Paper we briefly discuss what could be observed with synthetic apertures over $\sim20\,$km -- resolving detail on white dwarfs at the level currently possible on supergiants.</description>

      <title>libyt: an In Situ Interface Connecting Simulations with yt, Python, and Jupyter Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the exascale computing era, handling and analyzing massive datasets have become extremely challenging. In situ analysis, which processes data during simulation runtime and bypasses costly intermediate I/O steps, offers a promising solution. We present libyt (https://github.com/yt-project/libyt), an open-source C library that enables astrophysical simulations to analyze and visualize data in parallel computation with yt or other Python packages. libyt can invoke Python routines automatically or provide interactive entry points via a Python prompt or a Jupyter Notebook. It requires minimal intervention in researchers' workflow, allowing users to reuse job submission scripts and Python routines. We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation. Finally, we discuss libyt's performance, limitations related to data redistribution, extensibility, architecture, and comparisons with traditional post-processing approaches.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Occultations with VERITAS: Observations and Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occultations, the covering up of one celestial body by another celestial body, have been used in astronomy for millennia to learn about the sun and moon. Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star. VERITAS has attempted to observe over 100 occultations to date and successfully observed 20 occultations. With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs.</description>

      <title>Classifying High-Energy Celestial Objects with Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets. In the field of astronomy, tree-based models and simple neural networks have recently garnered attention as a means of classifying celestial objects based on photometric data. We apply common tree-based models to assess performance of these models for discriminating objects with similar photometric signals, pulsars and black holes.
  We also train a RNN on a downsampled and normalized version of the raw signal data to examine its potential as a model capable of object discrimination and classification in real-time.</description>

      <title>amc: The Automated Mission Classifier for Telescope Bibliographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telescope bibliographies record the pulse of astronomy research by capturing publication statistics and citation metrics for telescope facilities. Robust and scalable bibliographies ensure that we can measure the scientific impact of our facilities and archives. However, the growing rate of publications threatens to outpace our ability to manually label astronomical literature. We therefore present the Automated Mission Classifier (amc), a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to identify and categorize telescope references by processing large quantities of paper text. A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors. Our work demonstrates that LLM-based applications offer powerful and scalable assistance for library sciences.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Development of a Pipeline to Detect Rapid Transients in Time-Ordered Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for detecting astrophysical transients evolving on timescales of milliseconds to minutes using cosmic microwave background (CMB) survey telescopes. While previous transient searches in CMB data operate in map space, our pipeline directly processes the raw time-ordered data, enabling sensitivity to fast, dynamic signals. We integrate our detection approach into the Simons Observatory time-domain pipeline and assess the performance on simulated observations with injected stellar flare-like light curves. For events flaring with a timescale of 0.5 s, the pipeline detects $\gtrsim90$% of events at flux densities of 800, 1150, 1650, and 4250 mJy when measured in the 93, 145, 225, and 280 GHz bands respectively. For longer $\ge5$ second flares, the 90% detection thresholds are reduced by a factor of four. We are able to determine the position of detected events in each observing band, with a positional uncertainty at the detection threshold comparable to the telescope resolution at that band. These results demonstrate the readiness of this pipeline for incorporation into upcoming Simons Observatory data analyses.</description>

      <title>UK White Paper on Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection powers explosive releases of magnetic energy, heating and particle acceleration throughout the plasma universe. Knowledge of this universal process is vital to understanding the Heliosphere, as it plays a key role in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, geomagnetic storms, and interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. As such, reconnection underpins multiple science objectives of multiple future space missions. The UK plays a leading role in this international field, through a combination of in situ measurements from Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, observations of the solar corona and chromosphere, and world-class numerical simulations and theory. This white paper identifies: Nine priority science objectives for reconnection research in the next decade; Recommendations to guide investment in theory, simulations and infrastructure; Mission priorities and required measurements to ensure the UK maintains and improves its world-class credentials in reconnection science.</description>

      <title>Transformer Embeddings for Fast Microlensing Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for free-floating planets (FFPs) is a key science driver for upcoming microlensing surveys like the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey. These rogue worlds are typically detected via short-duration microlensing events, the characterization of which often requires analyzing noisy, irregularly-sampled observations. We present a pipeline for this task using simulation-based inference. We use a Transformer encoder to learn a compressed summary representation of the raw time-series data, which in turn conditions a neural posterior estimator. We demonstrate that our method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors over three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We also demonstrate its performance on KMT-BLG-2019-2073, a short-duration FFP candidate event.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spectroscopic Binaries with Data-Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven stellar classification has a long and important history in astronomy, dating as far back as Annie Jump Cannon's "by eye" classifications of stars into spectral types still used today. In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</description>

      <title>An Open Benchmark of One Million High-Fidelity Cislunar Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cislunar space spans from geosynchronous altitudes to beyond the Moon and will underpin future exploration, science, and security operations. We describe and release an open dataset of one million numerically propagated cislunar trajectories generated with the open-source Space Situational Awareness Python package (SSAPy). The model includes high-degree Earth/Moon gravity, solar gravity, and Earth/Sun radiation pressure; other planetary gravities are omitted by design for computational efficiency. Initial conditions uniformly sample commonly used osculating-element ranges, and each trajectory is propagated for up to six years under a single, fixed start epoch. The dataset is intended as a reusable benchmark for method development (e.g., space domain awareness, navigation, and machine learning pipelines), a reference library for statistical studies of orbit families, and a starting point for community-driven extensions (e.g., alternative epochs). We report empirically observed stability trends (e.g., a band near 5 GEO and persistence of some co-orbital classes including L4/L5 librators) as dataset descriptors rather than new dynamical results. The chief contribution is the scale, fidelity, organization (CSV/HDF5 with full state time series and metadata), and open availability, which together lower the barrier to comparative and data-driven studies in the cislunar regime.</description>

      <title>Vibration Isolation for the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.</description>

      <title>CPI-C: Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is proposed to direct image the cool planets around nearby solar-type stars (within 40 pc). The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi-band photometry. CPI-C employs a step-transmission apodization technique to suppress the diffraction noises from the telescope pupil and a precise phase correction technique to eliminate the speckle noises due to imperfections of the optical surfaces. The contrast requirement is better than $10^{-8}$ at an inner working angle (IWA) of $3-4\lambda/D$, in the visible wavelength from 600 nm to 900 nm. CPI-C will be the first space-based instrument capable of directly imaging the reflection light from the cool exoplanets in the visible wavelength enabling the measurement of key physical parameters such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, mass, and other key parameters. The potential observation results will significantly contribute to further understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of planets, which will also lay a solid foundation for future confirmation of the Earth-twins in the next generation space flagship missions.</description>

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for numerical magnetohydrodynamics on staggered meshes preserving $\nabla \cdot B = 0$. Our algorithm is based on the constrained transport method and supports both cell-based adaptive mesh refinement and temporal substepping. We handle resolution changes directly on the logically Cartesian grid without needing interpolation or projection between nested or neighboring grids, nor coupling the solution between refinement levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun periodically emits intense bursts of radio emission known as solar radio bursts (SRBs). These bursts can disrupt radio communications and be indicative of large solar events that can disrupt technological infrastructure on Earth and in space. The risks posed by these events highlight the need for automated SRB classification, providing the potential to improve event detection and real-time monitoring. This would advance the techniques used to study space weather and related phenomena. A dataset containing images of radio spectra was created using data recorded by the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (e-Callisto) network. This dataset comprises three categories: empty spectrograms; spectrograms containing Type II SRBs; and spectrograms containing Type III SRBs. These images were used to fine-tune several popular pre-trained deep learning models for classifying Type II and Type III SRBs. The evaluated models included VGGnet-19, MobileNet, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and YOLOv8. Testing the models on the test set produced F1 scores ranging from 87\% to 92\%. YOLOv8 emerged as the best-performing model among them, demonstrating that using pre-trained models for event classification can provide an automated solution for SRB classification. This approach provides a practical solution to the limited number of data samples available for Type II SRBs.</description>

      <title>The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-band HSC-CLAUDS survey comprises several sky regions with varying observing conditions, only one of which, the COSMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF), offers extensive redshift coverage. We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i&lt;25 (z&lt;~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i&lt;25) are made public.</description>

      <title>Portable Adaptive Optics for Exoplanet Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.08050v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Portable Adaptive Optics (PAO) is a low-cost and compact system, designed for 4-meter class telescopes that have no Adaptive Optics (AO), because of the physical space limitation at the Nasmyth or Cassegrain focus and the historically high cost of the conventional AO. The initial scientific observations of the PAO are focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and sub-stellar companions. This paper discusses the PAO concept and the associated high-contrast imaging performance in our recent observational runs. PAO is delivering a Strehl ratio better than $60\%$ in $H$ band under median seeing conditions of $1 ''$. Combined with our dedicated image rotation and subtraction (IRS) technique and the optimized IRS (O-IRS) algorithm, the averaged contrast ratio for a $5\leq V\rm_{mag} \leq 9$ primary star is $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ and $3.3 \times 10^{-6}$ at angular distance of $0.36 ''$ under exposure time of 7 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. PAO has successfully revealed the known exoplanet of $\kappa$ And b, in our recent observation at 3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory. We have performed the associated astrometry and photometry analysis of the recovered $\kappa$ And b planet, which gives a projected separation of $0.984 \pm 0.05 ''$, a position angle of $51.1 \pm 0.5^{\circ}$, and a mass of $10.15_{-1.255}^{+2.19}M_{\rm Jup}$. These results demonstrate that PAO can be used for direct imaging of exoplanets with medium-sized telescopes.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Temporal Muon Signals in Water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory is a 3000 km$^2$ array of stations, whose main components are Water-Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) recording ground-level signals from Extensive Air Showers (EASs) initiated by Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). Understanding the physics of UHECRs requires knowledge of their mass composition, for which the number of ground muons is a key probe. Isolating the muon component is difficult, as different types of particles contribute to the SD signal. We apply a recurrent neural network to estimate the muon content of the SD signals, showing small bias in simulations and weak dependence on selected hadronic interaction model.</description>

      <title>Decisively Demonstrating Roman CGI's TTR5 Requirement by Reimaging a Newly-Discovered Brown Dwarf Orbiting a Bright Accelerating Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Roman Coronagraph project HLC/575 nm observations of a newly-discovered brown dwarf (HIP 71618 B) from the Subaru/OASIS survey of young accelerating stars, which is supported by NASA headquarters with the directive to identify targets for the Roman Coronagraph that could fulfill TTR5 requirements and be observed during the technology demonstration phase. The target and multiple bright PSF references are within/close to the Roman Continuous Viewing Zone. A high SNR detection of this companion would singlehandedly fulfill TTR5 and would be the first optical detection of a companion at $&lt;$10$^{-6}$ contrast.
  Roman CPP reference star vetting prioritizing stars that can be paired with HIP 71618 would aid the execution of a successful technology demonstration. Additional similar targets may be discovered from OASIS over the next few years that could increase CGI scheduling flexibility and enhance its scientific and technical return. A close collaborative partnership with the CPP team could ensure that they are schedulable.</description>

      <title>Fast LISA Likelihood Approximations by Downsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is due to launch in the mid-2030s. A key challenge for LISA data analysis is efficient Bayesian inference with parametrised gravitational-wave models, particularly for early inspirals of low- and intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, where time series can contain $\sim 10^8$-$10^9$ samples and naive likelihood evaluations become prohibitively expensive. For purely simulated studies, we present a simple time-domain likelihood-approximation scheme for such signals. The method retains only a small subset of samples and defines a modified noise-weighted inner product on this reduced set that closely reproduces the original inner product on the waveform manifold. Because this alters the effective noise model, the scheme is intended for simulated LISA data rather than direct analysis of real LISA data. In our examples, the resulting posteriors agree to high accuracy with those obtained using much denser sampling, while retaining only $10^3$-$10^4$ samples. The computational cost then scales linearly with the number of retained samples $N_s$, so the speed-up is roughly $N/N_s$, where $N$ is the original data length; for realistic LISA-like datasets with $N\sim10^8$-$10^9$ this would correspond to gains of order $10^4$-$10^6$ over straightforward frequency-domain likelihood evaluations of the full dataset. The time-domain formulation is particularly convenient for incorporating waveform modifications from non-trivial astrophysical environments or alternative-gravity effects. The results presented here provide the theoretical basis for the software package \texttt{Dolfen}.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning of halo gas density profiles: a sensitivity analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</description>

      <title>BinaryGFH-v2: Improved method to search for gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact binaries using the Generalized Frequency-Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing gravitational waves from sub-solar-mass, inspiraling compact binaries would provide almost smoking-gun evidence for primordial black holes. Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves.</description>
