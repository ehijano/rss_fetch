      <title>Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure of the feedback policies. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the optimal policies under several commonly used S-shaped utilities, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their financial implications.</description>

      <title>Power Utility Maximization with Expert Opinions at Fixed Arrival Times in a Market with Hidden Gaussian Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study optimal trading strategies in a financial market in which stock returns depend on a hidden Gaussian mean reverting drift process. Investors obtain information on that drift by observing stock returns. Moreover, expert opinions in the form of signals about the current state of the drift arriving at fixed and known dates are included in the analysis. Drift estimates are based on Kalman filter techniques. They are used to transform a power utility maximization problem under partial information into an optimization problem under full information where the state variable is the filter of the drift. The dynamic programming equation for this problem is studied and closed-form solutions for the value function and the optimal trading strategy of an investor are derived. They allow to quantify the monetary value of information delivered by the expert opinions. We illustrate our theoretical findings by results of extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Optimization in a Market with Hidden Gaussian Drift and Randomly Arriving Expert Opinions: Modeling and Theoretical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal selection of portfolios for power utility maximizing investors in a financial market where stock returns depend on a hidden Gaussian mean reverting drift process. Information on the drift is obtained from returns and expert opinions in the form of noisy signals about the current state of the drift arriving randomly over time. The arrival dates are modeled as the jump times of a homogeneous Poisson process. Applying Kalman filter techniques we derive estimates of the hidden drift which are described by the conditional mean and covariance of the drift given the observations. The utility maximization problem is solved with dynamic programming methods. We derive the associated dynamic programming equation and study regularization arguments for a rigorous mathematical justification.</description>
