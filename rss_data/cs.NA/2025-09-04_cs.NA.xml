      <title>Stabilization-free virtual element method for 2D third medium contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third medium contact has been proven to be an effective approach for simulating contact problems involving large deformations. Unlike traditional contact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between two contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact constraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different applications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a generalization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM) can handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for modeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the projection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the rank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third medium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which further complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the stabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to solve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM, SFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the construction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon the traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of SFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of high-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of SFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems.</description>

      <title>ARDO: A Weak Formulation Deep Neural Network Method for Elliptic and Parabolic PDEs Based on Random Differences of Test Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ARDO method for solving PDEs and PDE-related problems with deep learning techniques. This method uses a weak adversarial formulation but transfers the random difference operator onto the test function. The main advantage of this framework is that it is fully derivative-free with respect to the solution neural network. This framework is particularly suitable for Fokker-Planck type second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Error and long-term analysis of two-step symmetric methods for relativistic charged-particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the error estimates and the long-time conservation or near-conservation of geometric structures, including energy, mass shell and phase-space volume, for four two-step symmetric methods applied to relativistic charged-particle dynamics. We begin by introducing a two-step symmetric numerical method based on a splitting scheme that exactly preserves the mass shell and the phase-space volume of the relativistic system. Building on this formulation, we develop three additional two-step symmetric methods with further modifications, for which the long-time near-conservation of energy and mass shell can be rigorously established through the backward error analysis. All methods are shown to achieve second-order accuracy. The theoretical results are illustrated and complemented by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fluid boundary conditions in kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kinetic-Diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) method is a powerful tool for simulating neutral particles in fusion reactors. It is a hybrid fluid-kinetic method that is significantly faster than pure kinetic methods at the cost of a small bias due to fluid approximations. Unfortunately, when simulating particles close to a boundary, it needs to switch to a purely kinetic method, which is significantly slower. In this paper, we will extend the method so that it can accurately take boundary conditions into account without switching to a purely kinetic method. Experiments show that this extension can lead to a speedup of up to 500 times compared to a KDMC method that switches to a purely kinetic method, while not sacrificing too much accuracy.</description>

      <title>A unified stabilized virtual element method for the generalized Oseen equation: stability and robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate a novel local projection based stabilized conforming virtual element method for the generalized Oseen problem using equal-order element pairs on general polygonal meshes. To ensure the stability, particularly in the presence of convection-dominated regimes and the utilization of equal-order element pairs, we introduce local projections based stabilization techniques. We demonstrate the discrete inf-sup condition in the energy norm. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method also guarantees the stability properties for the Brinkman equation and the Stokes equation without introducing any additional conditions. Furthermore, we derive an optimal error estimates in the energy norm that underline the uniform convergence in the energy norm for the generalized Oseen problem with small diffusion. In addition, the error estimates remain valid and uniform for the Brinkman equation and the Stokes equation. Additionally, the convergence study shows that the proposed method is quasi-robust with respect to parameters. The proposed method offers several advantages, including simplicity in construction, easier implementation compared to residual-based stabilization techniques, and avoiding coupling between element pairs. We validate our theoretical findings through a series of numerical experiments, including diffusion-dominated and convection-dominated regimes.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates and space-adaptive mesh refinements for time-dependent scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a posteriori error estimates and their use for time-dependent acoustic scattering problems, formulated as a time-dependent boundary integral equation based on a single-layer ansatz. The integral equation is discretized by the convolution quadrature method in time and by boundary elements in space. We prove the reliability of an error estimator of residual type and study the resulting space-adaptive mesh refinements. Moreover, we present a simple modification of the convolution quadrature method based on temporal shifts, which recovers, for the boundary densities, the full classical temporal convergence order $2m-1$ of the temporal convolution quadrature method based on the $m$-stage convolution quadrature semi-discretization. We numerically observe that the adaptive scheme yields asymptotically optimal meshes for an acoustic scattering problem in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>An explicit splitting SAV scheme for the kinetic Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic Langevin dynamics finds diverse applications in various disciplines such as molecular dynamics and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, a novel splitting scalar auxiliary variable (SSAV) scheme is proposed for the dynamics, where the gradient of the potential $U$ is possibly non-globally Lipschitz continuous with superlinear growth. As an explicit scheme, the SSAV method is efficient, robust and is able to reproduce the energy structure of the original dynamics. By an energy argument, the SSAV scheme is proved to possess an exponential integrability property, which is crucial to establishing the order-one strong convergence without the global monotonicity condition. Moreover, moments of the numerical approximations are shown to have polynomial growth with respect to the time length. This helps us to obtain weak error estimates of order one, with error constants polynomially (not exponentially) depending on the time length. Despite the obtained polynomial growth, the explicit scheme is shown to be computationally effective for the approximation of the invariant distribution of the dynamics with exponential ergodicity. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical findings and to show the superiority of the algorithm in sampling.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for learning the time-stepping operator of evolutionary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as effective tools for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) including evolutionary problems. Classical numerical solvers for such PDEs often face challenges of balancing stability constraints and the high computational cost of iterative solvers. In contrast, DNNs offer a data-driven alternative through direct learning of time-stepping operators to achieve this balancing goal. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing the approximation of these operators using feedforward neural networks (FNNs). We derive explicit error estimates that characterize the dependence of the approximation error on the network architecture -- namely its width and depth -- as well as the number of training samples. Furthermore, we establish Lipschitz continuity properties of time-stepping operators associated with classical numerical schemes and identify low-complexity structures inherent in these operators for several classes of PDEs, including reaction-diffusion equations, parabolic equations with external forcing, and scalar conservation laws. Leveraging these structural insights, we obtain generalization bounds that demonstrate efficient learnability without incurring the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we extend our analysis from single-input operator learning to a general multi-input setting, thereby broadening the applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Projection-based stabilization for high-order incompressible flow solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel stabilization strategy for the Galerkin formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, developed to achieve high accuracy while ensuring convergence and compatibility with high-order elements on unstructured meshes. The numerical algorithm employs a fractional step method with carefully defined boundary conditions to obtain a consistent pressure field, enabling high-order temporal accuracy. The proposed stabilization is seamlessly integrated into the algorithm and shares the same underlying principle as the natural stabilization inherent in the fractional step method, both rely on the difference between the gradient operator and its projection. The numerical dissipation associated to the stabilization term is found to diminish with increasing polynomial order of the elements. Numerical test cases confirm the effectiveness of the method, demonstrating convergence under mesh refinement and increasing polynomial order.</description>

      <title>Randomized biorthogonalization through a two-sided Gram-Schmidt process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a randomized two-sided Gram-Schmidt process for the biorthogonalization of two given matrices $X, Y \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$. The algorithm aims to find two matrices $Q, P \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ such that ${\rm range}(X) = {\rm range}(Q)$, ${\rm range}(Y) = {\rm range}(P)$ and $(\Omega Q)^T \Omega P = I$, where $\Omega \in\mathbb{R}^{s \times n}$ is a sketching matrix satisfying an oblivious subspace $\varepsilon$-embedding property; in other words, the biorthogonality condition on the columns of $Q$ and $P$ is replaced by an equivalent condition on their sketches. This randomized approach is computationally less expensive than the classical two-sided Gram-Schmidt process, has better numerical stability, and the condition number of the computed bases $Q, P$ is often smaller than in the deterministic case. Several different implementations of the randomized algorithm are analyzed and compared numerically. The randomized two-sided Gram-Schmidt process is applied to the nonsymmetric Lancozs algorithm for the approximation of eigenvalues and both left and right eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>An Arbitrary-Order Moving-Mesh Finite Element Algorithm for One-Dimensional Implicit Moving Boundary Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a one-dimensional high-order moving-mesh finite element method for moving boundary problems where the boundary velocity depends implicitly on the solution in the interior of the domain. The method employs a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to predict the evolution of the approximate solution. It retains the order of accuracy of the underlying fixed-mesh method by (i) computing the boundary velocities using a high-order approximation to a distributed local conservation principle which generates a Lagrangian `flow' velocity and (ii) assuming a continuous piecewise linear variation of the mesh velocity field in the interior of the computational domain.
  Within each time-step the algorithm consists of two stages: the computation of a velocity field with which to move both the domain boundary and the internal mesh, and the approximation of the solution to the PDE on the updated mesh. Both internal and boundary velocities are generated within the same framework, though it would be simple to replace the internal mesh velocity field by applying a more traditional mesh movement strategy (for example, one which seeks to equidistribute an error indicator at each time-step): the high-order accuracy should be retained as long the discrete velocity which is used in the solution update is assumed to vary linearly within mesh elements. The proposed method is explicit in time, requires only the inversion of linear systems of equations within each time-step, and is implemented fully in the physical domain, so no mapping to a reference domain is employed. It attains arbitrary-order accuracy in both space and time without the need to satisfy a discrete geometric conservation law.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent modelling and simulation of two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposes a thermodynamically consistent two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model based on the Helmholtz free energy framework, which strictly satisfies both the principles of energy conservation and entropy increase in the two-fluid model. By constructing the convexe-concave characteristics of the free energy density (convexity with respect to plasma number density and concavity with respect to temperature), the model self-consistently derives key thermodynamic quantities such as chemical potential, entropy density, and internal energy. Based on the proposed modeling framework and the convex-concave properties of the Helmholtz free energy density, we develop a temporally discrete numerical scheme with thermodynamic consistency. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first law of thermodynamics (global energy conservation) and the second law (non-decreasing total entropy). Additionally, we provide spatiotemporal error estimates for the 2D degenerate system used in practical computations. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing key plasma phenomena.</description>

      <title>Learning functions through Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction, demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Prob-GParareal: A Probabilistic Numerical Parallel-in-Time Solver for Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical human heart modeling for predicting endocardial heart motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a biventricular electromechanical human heart model that is comprehensive and clinically relevant, integrating a realistic 3D heart geometry with both systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The model uses a two-way fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) formulation with actual 3D blood meshes to accurately investigate the effect of blood flow on the myocardium. It couples a reaction-diffusion framework and a voltage-dependent active stress term to replicate the link between electrical excitation and mechanical contraction. Additionally, the model incorporates innovative epicardial boundary conditions to mimic the stiffness and viscosity of neighboring tissues. The model's ability to replicate physiological heart motion was validated against Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which demonstrated a high degree of consistency in regional displacement patterns. The analysis of the right ventricle showed that the basal and mid free walls experience the largest motion, making these regions ideal for implanting motion-driven energy harvesting devices. This validated model is a robust tool for enhancing our understanding of cardiac physiology and optimizing therapeutic interventions before clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of an epidemic model with a mass vaccination program of a homogeneous population</title>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio ($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically stable Particle-in-Cell methods for the magnetized Vlasov--Poisson equations in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-temperature plasma physics, a strong magnetic field is usually used to confine charged particles. Therefore, for studying the classical mathematical models of the physical problems it needs to consider the effect of external magnetic fields. One of the important model equations in plasma is the Vlasov-Poisson equation with an external magnetic field. This equation usually has multi-scale characteristics and rich physical properties, thus it is very important and meaningful to construct numerical methods that can maintain the physical properties inherited by the original systems over long time. This paper extends the corresponding theory in Cartesian coordinates to general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, and proves that a Poisson-bracket structure can still be obtained after applying the corresponding finite element discretization. However, the Hamiltonian systems in the new coordinate systems generally cannot be decomposed into sub-systems that can be solved accurately, so it is impossible to use the splitting methods to construct the corresponding geometric integrators. Therefore, this paper proposes a semi-implicit method for strong magnetic fields and analyzes the asymptotic stability of this method.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Distributed memory parallel adaptive tensor-train cross approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor-train (TT) format is a data-sparse tensor representation commonly used in high dimensional function approximations arising from computational and data sciences. Various sequential and parallel TT decomposition algorithms have been proposed for different tensor inputs and assumptions. In this paper, we propose subtensor parallel adaptive TT cross, which partitions a tensor onto distributed memory machines with multidimensional process grids, and constructs an TT approximation iteratively with tensor elements. We derive two iterative formulations for pivot selection and TT core construction under the distributed memory setting, conduct communication and scaling analysis of the algorithm, and illustrate its performance with multiple test experiments. These include up to 6D Hilbert tensors and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy with greatly reduced storage requirements via the TT cross approximation. Furthermore, we demonstrate good to optimal strong and weak scaling performance for the proposed parallel algorithm.</description>

      <title>A parallel batch greedy algorithm in reduced basis methods: Convergence rates and numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "classical" (weak) greedy algorithm is widely used within model order reduction in order to compute a reduced basis in the offline training phase: An a posteriori error estimator is maximized and the snapshot corresponding to the maximizer is added to the basis. Since these snapshots are determined by a sufficiently detailed discretization, the offline phase is often computationally extremely costly. We suggest to replace the serial determination of one snapshot after the other by a parallel approach. In order to do so, we introduce a batch size $b$ and add $b$ snapshots to the current basis in every greedy iteration. These snapshots are computed in parallel. We prove convergence rates for this new batch greedy algorithm and compare them to those of the classical (weak) greedy algorithm in the Hilbert and Banach space case. Then, we present numerical results where we apply a (parallel) implementation of the proposed algorithm to the linear elliptic thermal block problem. We analyze the convergence rate as well as the offline and online wall-clock times for different batch sizes. We show that the proposed variant can significantly speed-up the offline phase while the size of the reduced problem is only moderately increased. The benefit of the parallel batch greedy increases for more complicated problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of a class of highly-oscillatory transport equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present quantum algorithms for a class of highly-oscillatory transport equations, which arise in semiclassical computation of surface hopping problems and other related non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Our method relies on the classical nonlinear geometric optics method, and the recently developed Schr\"odingerisation approach for quantum simulation of partial differential equations. The Schr\"odingerisation technique can transform any linear ordinary and partial differential equations into Hamiltonian systems evolving under unitary dynamics, via a warped phase transformation that maps these equations to one higher dimension. We study possible paths for better recoveries of the solution to the original problem by shifting the bad eigenvalues in the Schr\"odingerized system. Our method ensures the uniform error estimates independent of the wave length, thus allowing numerical accuracy, in maximum norm, even without numerically resolving the physical oscillations. Various numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the validity of this approach.</description>

      <title>Axial Behaviour of Pre-Damaged RC Short Columns Retrofitted with Square Corrugated Steel Jackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a strengthening method employing square corrugated steel jackets as external confinement, which significantly enhances both the bearing capacity and ductility of existing reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Axial compression tests were conducted on ten short column specimens to evaluate the effects of corrugated steel thickness (1.6, 2.0, and 2.7 mm), preloading level before jacketing (40%, 60%, and 100% of the original capacity), and connection type (welding vs. bolting). A computational model was developed to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of the strengthened sections. The main findings are as follows: (1) The corrugated steel jackets increased the ultimate bearing capacity of the existing RC columns by 34.6% to 67.3%. (2) Given the relatively low confinement efficiency in square sections, thinner corrugated steel plates can be used in a material-efficient manner to achieve comparable strengthening effects. (3) Fully welded connections between corrugated plates induce less stress concentration and provide better transverse confinement effectiveness compared to bolted connections. (4) In a pre-unloaded column, greater existed damage causes concrete softening and increased lateral expansion under re-compression. This dilation promotes a tighter interaction between the core concrete and the outer jacket, activating stronger passive confinement after being jacketed. (5) The low longitudinal stresses in the jacket indicate that its primary role is to provide lateral confinement rather than to resist axial loads directly. (6) It is recommended to employ a calculation method that accounts for both pre-damage and confinement effects to ensure a conservative and reliable design of corrugated steel-jacketed RC columns with pre-damage.</description>

      <title>Weighting operators for sparsity regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard regularization methods typically favor solutions which are in, or close to, the orthogonal complement of the null space of the forward operator/matrix $\mathsf{A}$. This particular biasedness might not be desirable in applications and can lead to severe challenges when $\mathsf{A}$ is non-injective.
  We have therefore, in a series of papers, investigated how to "remedy" this fact, relative to a chosen basis and in a certain mathematical sense: Based on a weighting procedure, it turns out that it is possible to modify both Tikhonov and sparsity regularization such that each member of the chosen basis can be almost perfectly recovered from their image under $\mathsf{A}$. In particular, we have studied this problem for the task of using boundary data to identify the source term in an elliptic PDE. However, this weighting procedure involves $\mathsf{A}^\dagger \mathsf{A}$, where $\mathsf{A}^\dagger$ denotes the pseudo inverse of $\mathsf{A}$, and can thus be CPU-demanding and lead to undesirable error amplification.
  We therefore, in this paper, study alternative weighting approaches and prove that some of the recovery results established for the methodology involving $\mathsf{A}$ hold for a broader class of weighting schemes. In fact, it turns out that "any" linear operator $\mathsf{B}$ has an associated proper weighting defined in terms of images under $\mathsf{B}\mathsf{A}$. We also present a series of numerical experiments, employing different choices of $\mathsf{B}$.</description>

      <title>From eigenvector nonlinearities with quadratic structure to eigenvalue nonlinearities with algebraic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, transformations between different classes of eigenvalue problems have played a central role in the development of numerical methods for eigenvalue computations. One of the most well-known and successful examples of this is the companion linearization for polynomial eigenvalue problems. In this paper, we construct a transformation that equivalently reframes a specific type of eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities (NEPv) into an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue nonlinearities (NEP). The NEPv class considered consists of nonlinearities expressed as sums of products of matrices and scalar functions, where the scalar functions depend nonlinearly on the eigenvector. Our transformation defines scalar eigenvalue nonlinearities through a polynomial system, resulting in NEP nonlinearities of algebraic type. We propose methods to solve the polynomial system, one of which involves a multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP). We adapt well-established NEP solvers to this setting, with the most effective strategy being a combination of deflation and a locally quadratically convergent iterative method. The efficiency and properties of the approach are illustrated by solving a problem related to a modification of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The simulations are reproducible and publicly available.</description>

      <title>Efficient QR-based Column Subset Selection through Randomized Sparse Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for column subset selection that combines the column-pivoted QR factorization with sparse subspace embeddings. The proposed method, SE-QRSC, is particularly effective for wide matrices with significantly more columns than rows. Starting from a matrix $A$, the algorithm selects $k$ columns from the sketched matrix $B = A \Omega^T$, where $\Omega$ is a sparse subspace embedding of $\mathrm{range}(A^T)$. The sparsity structure of $\Omega$ is then exploited to map the selected pivots back to the corresponding columns of $A$, which are then used to produce the final subset of selected columns. We prove that this procedure yields a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, thus revealing the spectrum of $A$. The resulting bounds exhibit a reduced dependence on the number of columns of $A$ compared to those obtained from the strong rank-revealing QR factorization of $A$. Moreover, when the leverage scores are known, such as for orthogonal matrices, or can be efficiently approximated, the bounds become entirely independent of the column dimension. For general matrices, the algorithm can be extended by first applying an additional subspace embedding of $range(A)$.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Towards Universal Neural PDE Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as promising tools to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits their generalization to diverse PDEs, preventing them from being practical surrogate models of numerical solvers. In this paper, we present Unisolver, a novel Transformer model trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs, aiming towards a universal neural PDE solver capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs that a PDE solution is fundamentally governed by a series of PDE components such as equation symbols and boundary conditions, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise and point-wise deep conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Many applications of computer vision rely on the alignment of similar but non-identical images. We present a fast algorithm for aligning heterogeneous images based on optimal transport. Our approach combines the speed of fast Fourier methods with the robustness of sliced probability metrics and allows us to efficiently compute the alignment between two $L \times L$ images using the sliced 2-Wasserstein distance in $O(L^2 \log L)$ operations. We show that our method is robust to translations, rotations and deformations in the images.</description>
