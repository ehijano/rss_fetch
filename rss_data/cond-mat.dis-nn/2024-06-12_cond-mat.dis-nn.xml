      <title>Dynamical Mean-Field Theory of Self-Attention Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse domains, becoming the state-of-the-art solution for addressing sequential machine learning problems. Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial communities are pivotal to maintaining ecological function and preserving the rich tapestry of biological diversity. The rapid development of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has revolutionized our capacity to probe such diversity. However, despite these advances, a theoretical understanding connecting empirical data with ecosystem modelling, in particular in the framework of disordered systems akin to spin glasses, is still in its infancy. Here, we present a comprehensive framework using theories of disordered systems to decode microbiome data, which offers insight into the ecological forces that shape macroecological states. By employing the quenched disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we analyze species abundance data in healthy and diseased human gut microbiomes. Results reveal the emergence of two distinct patterns of species-interaction networks, elucidating the pathways through which dysbiosis may drive microbiome instability. Interaction patterns thus provide a window into the systemic shifts accompanying the transition from health to disease, offering a new perspective on the dynamics of the microbial community. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered systems theory to characterize microbiomes by capturing the essence of ecological interactions and their consequences on stability and functioning, leveraging our understanding of the linkages of dysbiosis and microbial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials can exhibit electronic topological features yet are inherently quasiperiodic. Nonetheless, the localizing tendency of quasiperiodicity can be prevented by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Full transmission of vectorial waves through 3D multiple-scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking prediction from the random matrix theory in mesoscopic physics is the existence of "open channels": waves that can use multipath interference to achieve perfect transmission across an opaque disordered medium even in the multiple-scattering regime. Realization of such open channels requires a coherent control of the complete incident wavefront. To date, the open channels have only been demonstrated in scalar two-dimensional (2D) structures, both experimentally and with numerical studies. Here, we utilize a recently proposed "augmented partial factorization" full-wave simulation method to compute the scattering matrix from 3D vectorial Maxwell's equations and demonstrate the existence of open channels in 3D disordered media. We examine the spatial profile of such open channels, demonstrate the existence of a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution with full control, and study the effects of incomplete polarization control and of a finite illumination area. This study confirms the validity of the random matrix theory in vectorial systems. The simulation framework provides full access to the complex multi-channel wave transport in 3D disordered systems, filling the gap left by experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Training Dynamics of Nonlinear Contrastive Learning Model in the High Dimensional Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a high-dimensional analysis of the training dynamics for a single-layer nonlinear contrastive learning model. The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.</description>

      <title>Astrocytic NMDA Receptors Modulate the Dynamics of Continuous Attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal networking supports complex brain functions, with neurotransmitters facilitating communication through chemical synapses. The release probability of neurotransmitters varies and is influenced by pre-synaptic neuronal activity. Recent findings suggest that blocking astrocytic N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors reduces this variation. However, the theoretical implications of this reduction on neuronal dynamics have not been thoroughly investigated. Utilizing continuous attractor neural network (CANN) models with short-term synaptic depression (STD), we explore the effects of reduced release probability variation. Our results show that blocking astrocytic NMDA receptors stabilizes attractor states and diminishes their mobility. These insights enhance our understanding of NMDA receptors' role in astrocytes and their broader impact on neural computation and memory, with potential implications for neurological conditions involving NMDA receptor antagonists.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>

      <title>Average-exact mixed anomalies and compatible phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomaly of a global symmetry is known to strongly constrain the allowed low-energy physics in a clean and isolated quantum system. However, the effect of quantum anomalies in disordered systems is much less understood, especially when the global symmetry is only preserved on average by the disorder. In this work, we focus on disordered systems with both average and exact symmetries $A\times K$, where the exact symmetry $K$ is respected in every disorder configuration, and the average $A$ is only preserved on average by the disorder ensemble. When there is a mixed quantum anomaly between the average and exact symmetries, we argue that the mixed state representing the ensemble of disordered ground states cannot be featureless. While disordered mixed states smoothly connected to the anomaly-compatible phases in clean limit are certainly allowed, we also found disordered phases that have no clean-limit counterparts, including the glassy states with strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and average topological orders for certain anomalies. We construct solvable lattice models to demonstrate each of these possibilities. We also provide a field-theoretic argument to provide a criterion for whether a given average-exact mixed anomaly admits a compatible average topological order.</description>

      <title>Metastability in networks of nonlinear stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain continuously process the barrage of sensory inputs they receive from the environment. A wide array of experimental work has shown that the collective activity of neural populations encodes and processes this constant bombardment of information. How these collective patterns of activity depend on single neuron properties is often unclear. Single-neuron recordings have shown that individual neural responses to inputs are nonlinear, which prevents a straightforward extrapolation from single neuron features to emergent collective states. In this work, we use a field theoretic formulation of a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model to study the impact of nonlinear intensity functions on macroscopic network activity. We show that the interplay between nonlinear spike emission and membrane potential resets can i) give rise to metastable transitions between active firing rate states, and ii) can enhance or suppress mean firing rates and membrane potentials in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Role of Fock-space correlations in many-body localization</title>

Abstract: Models of many-body localization (MBL) can be represented as tight-binding models in the many-body Hilbert space (Fock space). We explore the role of correlations between matrix elements of the effective Fock-space Hamiltonians in the scaling of MBL critical disorder $W_c(n)$ with the size $n$ of the system. For this purpose, we consider five models, which all have the same distributions of diagonal (energy) and off-diagonal ("hopping") Fock-space matrix elements but different Fock-space correlations. These include quantum-dot (QD) and one-dimensional (1D) MBL models, their modifications (uQD and u1D models) with removed correlations of off-diagonal matrix elements, as well a quantum random energy model (QREM) with no correlations at all. Our numerical results are in full consistency with analytical arguments predicting $n^{3/4} (\ln n)^{-1/4} \lesssim W_c \lesssim n \ln n$ for the scaling of $W_c(n)$ in the QD model (we find $W_c \sim n$ numerically), $W_c(n) \sim \text{const.}$ for the 1D model, $W_c \sim n \ln n$ for the uQD and u1D models without off-diagonal correlations, and $W_c \sim n^{1/2} \ln n$ for QREM. The key difference between the QD and 1D models is in the structure of correlations of many-body energies. Removing off-diagonal Fock-space correlations makes both these models "maximally chaotic". Our findings demonstrate that the scaling of $W_c(n)$ for MBL transitions is governed by a combined effect of Fock-space correlations of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of mean-field theories in neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilization of artificial neural networks for representing quantum many-body wave functions has garnered significant attention, with enormous recent progress for both ground states and non-equilibrium dynamics. However, quantifying state complexity within this neural quantum states framework remains elusive. In this study, we address this key open question from the complementary point of view: Which states are simple to represent with neural quantum states? Concretely, we show on a general level that ground states of mean-field theories with permutation symmetry only require a limited number of independent neural network parameters. We analytically establish that, in the thermodynamic limit, convergence to the ground state of the fully-connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), the mean-field Ising model, can be achieved with just one single parameter. Expanding our analysis, we explore the behavior of the 1-parameter ansatz under breaking of the permutation symmetry. For that purpose, we consider the TFIM with tunable long-range interactions, characterized by an interaction exponent $\alpha$. We show analytically that the 1-parameter ansatz for the neural quantum state still accurately captures the ground state for a whole range of values for $0\le \alpha \le 1$, implying a mean-field description of the model in this regime.</description>
