      <title>Asymmetric coupling of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons: fractal attractors, quasi-multistability, and final state sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Control of Chaos: A Transformer-Based Approach for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic behavior in dynamical systems poses a significant challenge in trajectory control, traditionally relying on computationally intensive physical models. We present a machine learning-based algorithm to compute the minimum control bounds required to confine particles within a region indefinitely, using only samples of orbits that iterate within the region before diverging. This model-free approach achieves high accuracy, with a mean squared error of $2.88 \times 10^{-4}$ and computation times in the range of seconds. The results highlight its efficiency and potential for real-time control of chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control in dynamical systems using reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a data-driven technique for adaptive control in dynamical systems that exploits the reservoir computing method. We show that a reservoir computer can be trained to predict a system parameter from the time series data. Subsequently, a control signal based on the predicted parameter can be used as feedback to the dynamical system to lead it to a target state. Our results show that the dynamical system can be controlled throughout a wide range of attractor types. One set of training data consisting of only a few time series corresponding to the known parameter values enables our scheme to control a dynamical system to an arbitrary target attractor starting from any other initial attractor. In addition to numerical results, we implement our scheme in real-world systems like on a R\"{o}ssler system realized in an electronic circuit to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Building transport models from baroclinic wave experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study baroclinic waves both from the experimental and the theoretical perspective. We obtain data from a rotating annulus experiment capable of producing a series of baroclinic eddies similar to those found in the mid-latitude atmosphere. We analyze the experimental outputs using two methods. First, we apply a technique that involves filtering data using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, which is applied to both velocity and surface temperature fields. The second method relies on the construction of a simple kinematic model based on key parameters derived from the experimental data. To analyze eddy-driven fluid transport, we apply the method of Lagrangian descriptors to the underlying velocity field, revealing the attracting material curves that act as transport barriers in the system. These structures effectively capture the essential characteristics of the baroclinic flow and the associated transport phenomena. Our results show that these barriers are in good agreement with the transport patterns observed in the rotating annulus experiment. In particular, we observe that the structures obtained from the kinematic model, or the one derived in terms of filtered velocities, perform well in this regard.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Multifractal Behavior of the Human Genome T2T-CHM13v2.0: Graphical Representations and Cytogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we applied the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) to the complete human genomic sequence T2T-CHM13v2.0, analyzing the entire chromosome assembly and each chromosome separately, including mitochondrial DNA. Multifractal spectra were determined using two types of box-counting coverage, revealing slight variations across most chromosomes. While the geometric support remained consistent, distinct distributions were observed for each chromosome. Chromosomes 9 and Y exhibited the greatest differences in singularity (H\"older exponent), with minor variations in their fractal support. The CGR distributions generally demonstrated an approximate separation between coding and non-coding sections, as well as CpG or GpC islands. A base-by-base analysis of the fractal support of the CGR uncovered characteristic structural bands in chromosome sequences, which align with patterns identified in cytogenetic studies. Using the complete assembly as a reference, we compared two alternative representations: the Binary Genomic Representation (RGB) and the Markov Chain (MC) representation. Both methods tended toward the same fractal support but displayed differing distributions based on the assigned length parameter. Multifractal analysis highlighted quantitative differences between these representations: RGB aligned more closely with high-frequency components, while MC showed better correspondence with low frequencies. The optimal fit was achieved using MC for twelve-base chains, yielding an average percentage error of 2% relative to the full genomic assembly.</description>

      <title>Local integrability breaking and exponential localization of leading Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study integrability breaking and transport in a discrete space-time lattice with a local integrability breaking perturbation. We find a singular distribution of the Lyapunov spectrum where the majority of Lyapunov exponents vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The sub-extensive sequence of nonzero exponents, converging in the thermodynamic limit, correspond to Lyapunov vectors that are exponentially localized with localization lengths proportional to inverse Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, we investigate the transport behavior of the system by considering the spin-spin and current-current spatio-temporal correlation functions. Our results indicate that the overall transport behavior, similarly as in the purely integrable case, conforms to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling in the thermodynamic limit and at vanishing magnetization. The same dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ governs the effect of local perturbation spreading in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Turing patterns, chaos and strange attractors in a reaction-diffusion system augmented with self- and cross-diffusion terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce an original model in order to study the emergence of chaos in a reaction diffusion system in the presence of self- and cross-diffusion terms. A Fourier Spectral Method is derived to approximate equilibria and orbits of the latter. Special attention is paid to accuracy, a necessary condition when one wants to catch periodic orbits and to perform their linear stability analysis via Floquet multipliers. Bifurcations with respect to a single control parameter are studied in four different regimes of diffusion: linear diffusion, self-diffusion for each of the two species, and cross-diffusion. Key observations are made: development of original Turing patterns, Hopf bifurcations leading to oscillating patterns and period doubling cascades leading to chaos. Eventually, original strange attractors are reported in phase space.</description>

      <title>Structured pathways in the turbulence organizing recent oil spill events in the Eastern Mediterranean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic nature of ocean motion is a major challenge that hinders the discovery of spatio-temporal current routes that govern the transport of material. Certain material, such as oil spills, pose significant environmental threats and these are enhanced by the fact that they evolve in a chaotic sea, in a way which still nowadays is far from being systematically anticipated. Recently such an oil spill event has affected the Mediterranean coast of several Middle Eastern countries. No accidents were reported for these spills previous to their arrival at the coast, and therefore there was no hint of their origin. Modelling such an event, in which uncertainties are increased due to the lack of information on where and when the spills was produced, stretches available technologies to their limits, and requires the use of novel ideas that help to understand the essential features of oil and tar transport by ocean currents. In this regard Lagrangian Coherent Structures enable us to find order within ocean chaos and provide powerful insights into chaotic events and their relationships over different locations and times like the one addressed. Using the observed locations of the oil impacting the coast at specific times, we seek to determine its original location and the time it was released in the open ocean. We have determined both using a combination of earlier satellite observations and computational modelling of the time evolution. The observed agreement between modeled cases and satellite observations highlights the power of these ideas.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Geometry in the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical motions across the ocean are central to processes, like CO$_2$ fixation, heat removal or pollutant transport, which are essential to the Earth's climate. This work explores 3D conveyor routes {associated with} the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our findings show the geometry of mixing structures in the upper and deep ocean layers by means of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. This tool identifies among others, zones linked to vertical transport and characterizes vertical transport time scales. We focus the study in two regions. The first one is the Flemish Cap region, a zone of interaction between the major AMOC components, where our analysis identifies a domain of deep waters that ascend very rapidly to the ocean surface. The second one is the Irminger Sea, where our analysis confirms the existence of a downwelling zone, and reveals a previously unreported upwelling connection between very deep waters and the ocean surface.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering a simple setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} &lt; 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</description>
