      <title>Fear and Loathing on the Frontline: Decoding the Language of Othering by Russia-Ukraine War Bloggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Othering, the act of portraying outgroups as fundamentally different from the ingroup, often escalates into framing them as existential threats--fueling intergroup conflict and justifying exclusion and violence. These dynamics are alarmingly pervasive, spanning from the extreme historical examples of genocides against minorities in Germany and Rwanda to the ongoing violence and rhetoric targeting migrants in the US and Europe. While concepts like hate speech and fear speech have been explored in existing literature, they capture only part of this broader and more nuanced dynamic which can often be harder to detect, particularly in online speech and propaganda. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to quantify othering across diverse contexts, extending beyond traditional linguistic indicators of hostility. Applying the model to real-world data from Telegram war bloggers and political discussions on Gab reveals how othering escalates during conflicts, interacts with moral language, and garners significant attention, particularly during periods of crisis. Our framework, designed to offer deeper insights into othering dynamics, combines with a rapid adaptation process to provide essential tools for mitigating othering's adverse impacts on social cohesion.</description>

      <title>Predicting soccer matches with complex networks and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soccer attracts the attention of many researchers and professionals in the sports industry. Therefore, the incorporation of science into the sport is constantly growing, with increasing investments in performance analysis and sports prediction industries. This study aims to (i) highlight the use of complex networks as an alternative tool for predicting soccer match outcomes, and (ii) show how the combination of structural analysis of passing networks with match statistical data can provide deeper insights into the game patterns and strategies used by teams. In order to do so, complex network metrics and match statistics were used to build machine learning models that predict the wins and losses of soccer teams in different leagues. The results showed that models based on passing networks were as effective as ``traditional'' models, which use general match statistics. Another finding was that by combining both approaches, more accurate models were obtained than when they were used separately, demonstrating that the fusion of such approaches can offer a deeper understanding of game patterns, allowing the comprehension of tactics employed by teams relationships between players, their positions, and interactions during matches. It is worth mentioning that both network metrics and match statistics were important and impactful for the mixed model. Furthermore, the use of networks with a lower granularity of temporal evolution (such as creating a network for each half of the match) performed better than a single network for the entire game.</description>

      <title>RTs != Endorsements: Rethinking Exposure Fairness on Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems underpin many of the personalized services in the online information &amp; social media ecosystem. However, the assumptions in the research on content recommendations in domains like search, video, and music are often applied wholesale to domains that require a better understanding of why and how users interact with the systems. In this position paper we focus on social media and argue that personalized timelines have an added layer of complexity that is derived from the social nature of the platform itself. In particular, definitions of exposure fairness should be expanded to consider the social environment each user is situated in: how often a user is exposed to others is as important as who they get exposed to.</description>

      <title>Engagement, Content Quality and Ideology over Time on the Facebook URL Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unpacking the relationship between the ideology of social media users and their online news consumption offers critical insight into the feedback loop between users' engagement behavior and the recommender systems' content provision. However, disentangling inherent user behavior from platform-induced influences poses significant challenges, particularly when working with datasets covering limited time periods. In this study, we conduct both aggregate and longitudinal analyses using the Facebook Privacy-Protected Full URLs Dataset, examining user engagement metrics related to news URLs in the U.S. from January 2017 to December 2020. By incorporating the ideological alignment and quality of news sources, along with users' political preferences, we construct weighted averages of ideology and quality of news consumption for liberal, conservative, and moderate audiences. This allows us to track the evolution of (i) the ideological gap between liberals and conservatives and (ii) the average quality of each group's news consumption. These metrics are linked to broader phenomena such as polarization and misinformation. We identify two significant shifts in trends for both metrics, each coinciding with changes in user engagement. Interestingly, during both inflection points, the ideological gap widens and news quality declines; however, engagement increases after the first one and decreases after the second. Finally, we contextualize these changes by discussing their potential relation to two major updates to Facebook's News Feed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cross-Target Stance Detection: A Survey of Techniques, Datasets, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance detection is the task of determining the viewpoint expressed in a text towards a given target. A specific direction within the task focuses on cross-target stance detection, where a model trained on samples pertaining to certain targets is then applied to a new, unseen target. With the increasing need to analyze and mining viewpoints and opinions online, the task has recently seen a significant surge in interest. This review paper examines the advancements in cross-target stance detection over the last decade, highlighting the evolution from basic statistical methods to contemporary neural and LLM-based models. These advancements have led to notable improvements in accuracy and adaptability. Innovative approaches include the use of topic-grouped attention and adversarial learning for zero-shot detection, as well as fine-tuning techniques that enhance model robustness. Additionally, prompt-tuning methods and the integration of external knowledge have further refined model performance. A comprehensive overview of the datasets used for evaluating these models is also provided, offering valuable insights into the progress and challenges in the field. We conclude by highlighting emerging directions of research and by suggesting avenues for future work in the task.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks from Gene Expression Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the complexities of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Traditional computational methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of these networks. This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a powerful approach for modeling graph-structured data like GRNs. Utilizing a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2), our study presents a novel approach to the construction and interrogation of GRNs, informed by gene expression data and Boolean models derived from literature. The model's adeptness in accurately predicting regulatory interactions and pinpointing key regulators is attributed to advanced attention mechanisms, a hallmark of the GNN framework. These insights suggest that GNNs are primed to revolutionize GRN analysis, addressing traditional limitations and offering richer biological insights. The success of GNNs, as highlighted by our model's reliance on high-quality data, calls for enhanced data collection methods to sustain progress. The integration of GNNs in GRN research is set to pioneer developments in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and our grasp of biological systems, bolstered by the structural analysis of networks for improved node and edge prediction.</description>

      <title>MQuinE: a cure for "Z-paradox" in knowledge graph embedding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models achieved state-of-the-art results on many knowledge graph tasks including link prediction and information retrieval. Despite the superior performance of KGE models in practice, we discover a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular existing KGE models called \emph{Z-paradox}. Motivated by the existence of Z-paradox, we propose a new KGE model called \emph{MQuinE} that does not suffer from Z-paradox while preserves strong expressiveness to model various relation patterns including symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and composition relations with theoretical justification. Experiments on real-world knowledge bases indicate that Z-paradox indeed degrades the performance of existing KGE models, and can cause more than 20\% accuracy drop on some challenging test samples. Our experiments further demonstrate that MQuinE can mitigate the negative impact of Z-paradox and outperform existing KGE models by a visible margin on link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Improving global awareness of linkset predictions using Cross-Attentive Modulation tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces Cross-Attentive Modulation (CAM) tokens, which are tokens whose initial value is learned, gather information through cross-attention, and modulate the nodes and edges accordingly. These tokens are meant to improve the global awareness of link predictions models which, based on graph neural networks, can struggle to capture graph-level features. This lack of ability to feature high level representations is particularly limiting when predicting multiple or entire sets of links. We implement CAM tokens in a simple attention-based link prediction model and in a graph transformer, which we also use in a denoising diffusion framework. A brief introduction to our toy datasets will then be followed by benchmarks which prove that CAM token improve the performance of the model they supplement and outperform a baseline with diverse statistical graph attributes.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Few-Shot Learning on Graphs: from Meta-Learning to Pre-Training and Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning, a critical step in graph-centric tasks, has seen significant advancements. Earlier techniques often operate in an end-to-end setting, which heavily rely on the availability of ample labeled data. This constraint has spurred the emergence of few-shot learning on graphs, where only a few labels are available for each task. Given the extensive literature in this field, this survey endeavors to synthesize recent developments, provide comparative insights, and identify future directions. We systematically categorize existing studies based on two major taxonomies: (1) Problem taxonomy, which explores different types of data scarcity problems and their applications, and (2) Technique taxonomy, which details key strategies for addressing these data-scarce few-shot problems. The techniques can be broadly categorized into meta-learning, pre-training, and hybrid approaches, with a finer-grained classification in each category to aid readers in their method selection process. Within each category, we analyze the relationships among these methods and compare their strengths and limitations. Finally, we outline prospective directions for few-shot learning on graphs to catalyze continued innovation in this field.

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least important nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. Furthermore, we introduce the core-periphery score to properly separate the core and periphery with our decomposition scheme. By extending the method combined with the network community structure, we successfully detect multiple core-periphery structures by decomposition inside each community. Moreover, the application of our decomposition to supernode networks defined from the communities reveals the intricate relation between the two representative mesoscale structures.</description>
