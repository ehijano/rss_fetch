      <title>Free phases of Majorana fermions: Tenfold ways compared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of neutral free fermions. Our approach utilizes Karoubi triples with negative squares, thought of as polarizations. We prove that neutral free fermion SPT phases protected by a symmetry algebra $A$ are classified by the real $K$-theory group $K_2(A^{op})$, and demonstrate how our classification reproduces known results in the presence of charge. Our formalism also allows for symmetries described by groups, potentially with time-reversal, using the formalism of fermionic groups and their fermionic group $C^*$-algebras. Our classification extends to positive spatial dimensions and includes weak phases using the crystalline equivalence principle. Our approach clarifies and unifies various existing tenfold way classifications by establishing their equivalence through Morita equivalences of symmetry algebras. We expect our classification to be the natural domain for the free-to-interacting map proposed by Freed and Hopkins.</description>

      <title>Paired $E_0$-Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we prove two main results:
  1) It is well-known that two strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroups on $B(H)$ can be paired if and only if they have anti-isomorphic Arveson systems. For a new notion of pairing (which coincides only for $B(H)$ with the existing one), we show: For a von Neumann algebra $B$, a strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroup on $B$ and a strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroup on $B'$ can be paired if and only if their product systems are commutants of each other.
  2) On the way to prove the former, en passant we have to fill in a long standing important gap in the theory of intertwiner product systems \`a la Arveson (known, so far, only for $B(H)$ in the separable case): Intertwiner product systems of faithful strongly continuous $E_0$-semigroups on von Neumann algebras have sufficiently many strongly continuous sections.
  We explain why both results are entirely out of reach for Arveson's methods [Arv89,Arv90] and depend essentially on the alternative approach from Skeide [Ske16].</description>

      <title>A new definition of outsplitting on $k$-graphs preserving Morita equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher rank graphs, also known as $k$-graphs, are a $k$-dimensional generalization of directed graphs and a rich source of examples of $C^*$-algebras. In the present paper, we contribute to the geometric classification program for $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras by introducing a new move on $k$-graphs, called LiMaR-split, which is a generalization of outsplit for directed graphs. We show, under one additional assumption, that LiMaR-split preserves the $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras up to Morita equivalence.</description>

      <title>Hermite trace polynomials and chaos decompositions for the Hermitian Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a non-zero parameter $q$, we define Hermite trace polynomials, which are multivariate polynomials indexed by permutations. We prove several combinatorial properties for them, such as expansions and product formulas. The linear functional determined by these trace polynomials is a state for $q = \frac{1}{N}$ for $N$ a non-zero integer. For such $q$, Hermite trace polynomials of different degrees are orthogonal. The product formulas extend to the closure with respect to the state. The state can be identified with the expectation induced by the $N \times N$ Hermitian Brownian motion. Hermite trace polynomials are martingales for this Brownian motion, while the elements in the closure can be interpreted as stochastic integrals with respect to it. Using the grading on the algebra, we prove several chaos decompositions for such integrals, as well as analyze corresponding creation and annihilation operators. In the univariate, pure trace polynomial case, trace Hermite polynomials can be identified with the Hermite polynomials of matrix argument.</description>
