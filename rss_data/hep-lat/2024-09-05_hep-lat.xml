      <title>JuliaQCD: Portable lattice QCD package in Julia language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new lattice gauge theory code set JuliaQCD using the Julia language. Julia is well-suited for integrating machine learning techniques and enables rapid prototyping and execution of algorithms for four dimensional QCD and other non-Abelian gauge theories. The code leverages LLVM for high-performance execution and supports MPI for parallel computations. Julia's multiple dispatch provides a flexible and intuitive framework for development. The code implements existing algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), many color and flavor, supports lattice fermions, smearing techniques, and full QCD simulations. It is designed to run efficiently across various platforms, from laptops to supercomputers, allowing for seamless scalability. The code set is currently available on GitHub https://github.com/JuliaQCD.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD extraction of the $\eta_{c}$-meson $t$-dependent parton distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of short-distance factorization, conveyed through the pseudo-distribution approach, connects space-like and light-cone correlators and thus allows for the extraction in lattice QCD of a number of parton distributions. We compute the $t$-dependent parton distribution function of valence quarks in a $\eta_{c}$-meson. After reviewing the main ideas behind the pseudo-distribution formalism, and relying on the analytic structure of Ioffe-time distributions, we come up with a proposal for a model-independent extraction of $t$-dependent parton distribution functions. We present results for the $\eta_{c}$-meson Ioffe time valence $t$-dependent parton distribution function at a renormalization scale of $3~\textrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>High Energy Physics from Low Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation between physics at low and high energies is essential for physics to have any utility; the details of quantum gravity are not necessary to calculate the trajectory of a cannon ball. However, physics at low and high energies are not completely independent, and this thesis explores two ways that they are related. The first is through a UV/IR symmetry that relates scattering processes at low and high energies. This UV/IR symmetry manifests in geometrical properties of the $S$-matrix, and of the RG flow of the coupling constants in the corresponding effective field theory. Low energy nuclear physics nearly realizes this UV/IR symmetry, providing an explanation for the smallness of shape parameters in the effective range expansion of nucleon-nucleon scattering, and inspiring a new way to organize the interactions between neutrons and protons. The second is through the use of quantum computers to simulate lattice gauge theories. Quantum simulations rely on the universality of the rules of quantum mechanics, which can be applied equally well to describe a (low energy) transmon qubit at 15 milli-Kelvin as a (high energy) 1 TeV quark. This thesis presents the first simulations of one dimensional lattice quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer, culminating in a real-time simulation of beta-decay. Results from the first simulations of a lattice gauge theory on 100+ qubits of a quantum computer are also presented. The methods developed in this thesis for quantum simulation are ``physics-aware", and are guided by the symmetries and hierarchies in length scales of the systems being studied. Without these physics-aware methods, 100+ qubit simulations of lattice gauge theories would not have been possible on the noisy quantum computers that are presently available.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark bound and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the energy spectrum of the S-wave doubly heavy tetraquark systems, including the $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$, $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar q$, and $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar s$ ($Q^{(\prime)}=b,c$ and $q=u,d$) systems within the constituent quark model. We use the complex scaling method to obtain bound states and resonant states simultaneously, and the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled four-body Schr\"odinger equation. With a novel definition of the root-mean-square radii, we are able to distinguish between meson molecules and compact tetraquark states. The compact tetraquarks are further classified into three different types with distinct spatial configurations: compact even tetraquarks, compact diquark-antidiquark tetraquarks and compact diquark-centered tetraquarks. In the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $QQ\bar q\bar q$ system, there exists the $ D^*D $ molecular bound state with a binding energy of $ -14 $ MeV, which is the candidate for $ T_{cc}(3875)^+ $. The shallow $\bar B^*\bar B$ molecular bound state is the bottom analogue of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. Moreover, we identify two resonant states near the $D^*D^*$ and $\bar B^*\bar B^*$ thresholds. In the $ J^P=1^+ $ $bb\bar q\bar q\,(I=0)$ and $bb\bar s\bar q$ systems, we obtain deeply bound states with a compact diquark-centered tetraquark configuration and a dominant $\chi_{\bar 3_c\otimes 3_c}$ component, along with resonant states with similar configurations as their radial excitations. These states are the QCD analogue of the helium atom. We also obtain some other bound states and resonant states with ``QCD Hydrogen molecule" configurations. Moreover, we investigate the heavy quark mass dependence of the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $ QQ\bar q\bar q $ bound states. We strongly urge the experimental search for the predicted states.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Simulating Fermions, Bosons, and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S))$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work establishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as a viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Primitive Quantum Gates for an SU(3) Discrete Subgroup: $\Sigma(36\times3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 108-element $\Sigma(36\times3)$ group. This is the first time a nonabelian crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ has been constructed for quantum simulation. The gauge link registers and necessary primitives -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the $\Sigma(36\times3)$ Fourier transform -- are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.</description>

      <title>Proper Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density and the pseudoscalar glueball mass in quenched lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper flow time for the Wilson flow in calculating the topological charge, topological susceptibility, and topological charge density correlator (TCDC) using the gluonic definition is analyzed. The proper flow time for the topological charge and TCDC is determined by different methods. The proper flow time may vary depending on whether the calculation is for the topological charge, topological density, topological susceptibility, or TCDC. Specifically, the flow time identified using the matching procedure is optimal for TCDC and a good choice for the topological susceptibility. Additionally, the pseudoscalar glueball is extracted from the TCDC using the bosonic definition at the identified proper flow time for three ensembles, and the continuum mass value is obtained through continuous extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical dualities in arbitrary dimensions are understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. By these results, we rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic "modulating" translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>
