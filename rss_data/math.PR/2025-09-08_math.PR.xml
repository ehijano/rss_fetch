      <title>Skorokhod Transition in the Conic Market Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the applicability of the Skorokhod representation theorem in filtrated probability spaces for the utility maximization problem in the Kabanov conic model of multi-asset markets with proportional transaction costs. A key challenge is that the theorem does not necessarily preserve adaptedness, meaning that solutions obtained on an auxiliary probability space may not correspond to those on the original one. We establish that, under mild conditions, the Bellman functionals remain consistent across different probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamical approach to area law for lattice Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we observe that the dynamical approach to lattice Yang-Mills set forth in [SZZ23] may also be applied to prove Wilson's area law in the 't Hooft regime of parameters. The main point is to verify the mass gap condition from [DF80], from which area law directly follows. Our results apply for gauge groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N), \mathrm{SU}(N), \mathrm{SO}(2N)\}$, which all have nontrivial center (which is one of the key assumptions in [DF80]).</description>

      <title>How two elephants can learn from each other</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-elephant walking model in which the elephants interact dynamically. At each time step, each elephant determines its next move randomly based on its partner's past movements. We show that the asymptotic behavior of the elephants mainly depends on the sign and the absolute value of the product of their reinforcement parameters. In various regimes, we establish the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Our proofs are based on a connection to the random recursive trees and employ stochastic approximation techniques and martingale methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal allocation of (perfect) vaccine in an heterogeneous SIS model. Using a coupling approach, we explain how different models for the heterogeneity of the population lead to the same Pareto frontier in the cost/loss valuation of the vaccinations strategies. This covers in particular the elementary continuous representation of discrete models and the measure preserving transformation which appears in graphon theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient estimation of jump parameters for stochastic differential equations driven by L{\'e}vy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a high-frequency context, we investigate the efficient estimation of scaling and jump activity parameters for a stochastic differential equation driven by a L{\'e}vy process with both diffusion component and pure-jump component. We first study efficiency for the prototype L{\'e}vy process. With an in-depth analysis of the behavior of the density of the process in small time, we prove that the LAN Property holds for the joint estimation of the diffusion, scaling and jump activity parameters. We next consider a stochastic equation driven both by a Brownian Motion and a locally stable pure-jump L{\'e}vy process. Using a quasi-likelihood estimation method, we exhibit an estimator that attains the optimal rate of convergence previously identified. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived from sharp approximation results for the stochastic equation and for the locally stable distribution.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Overlapping Generations Models Under Incomplete Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a stochastic analysis of an overlapping-generations model under incomplete markets. By casting individual optimisation with idiosyncratic income risk into a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) system, we (i) establish existence and uniqueness of the dynamic general-equilibirum interest rate and (ii) derive semi-explicit formulas for both the equilibrium interest rate path and the natural borrowing limit - defined as the discounted expected shortfall of future income. Our FBSDE-based approach yields tractable policy functions and equilibrium mappings without relying on high-dimensional PDE methods, offering clear insights into how income dynamics and demographic structure drive intereate-rate fluctuations and credit constraints.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young drivers II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues our previous work (Part I, arXiv:2504.18632v3) on the well-posedness of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, with particular focus on the case where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. To address this setting, we develop a new localization method that extends solvability from BSDEs with bounded drivers to those with unbounded ones. As a direct application, we derive a nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula for a class of partial differential equations driven by Young signals (Young PDEs). Moreover, employing the proposed localization method, we obtain error estimates that compare Cauchy-Dirichlet problems on bounded domains with their whole-space Cauchy counterparts, with special attention to non-Lipschitz PDEs.</description>

      <title>Genealogies under logistic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic behaviour of the genealogy of a logistic branching process in the setting where the equilibrium population size is large. In three regimes on the tail of the offspring distribution we recover the Kingman, $\text{Beta}(2-\alpha, \alpha)$ and Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescents as a scaling parameter governing the population size is taken to infinity, the deduction going via the convergence in distribution of a modified lookdown construction. This resolves a question asked in arxiv:2501.16837 who studied the same population process forwards in time and showed convergence of the type frequency process to the corresponding $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot process in each regime.</description>

      <title>Moments of density-dependent branching processes and their genealogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A density-dependent branching process is a particle system in which individuals reproduce independently, but in a way that depends on the current population size. This feature can model a wide range of ecological interactions at the cost of breaking the branching property. We propose a general approach for studying the genealogy of these models based on moments. Building on a recent work of Bansaye, we show how to compute recursively these moments in a similar spirit to the many-to-few formula in the theory of branching processes. These formulas enable one to deduce the convergence of the genealogy by studying the population density, for which stochastic calculus techniques are available. As a first application of these ideas, we consider a density-dependent branching process started close to a stable equilibrium of the ecological dynamics. We show that, under a finite second moment assumption, its genealogy converges to Kingman's coalescent when the carrying capacity of the population goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Construction of the 1d Self-repelling Brownian Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the self-repelling Brownian polymer, introduced in [APP83], which is formally defined as the solution of a singular SDE. The singularity comes from the drift term, which is given by the negative gradient of the local time. We construct a solution of the equation in d = 1, give a dynamic characterisation of its law, and show that it is the limiting distribution for a natural family of approximations. In addition, we show that the solution is superdiffusive.
  As part of the construction, we consider a singular SPDE which is solved by the (recentered) local time. Using the method of energy solutions, we show that this SPDE is well-posed, and prove that this property can be transferred to the original process. Our results hold for a larger class of drift terms, in which the gradient of the local time is a special case.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of quenched and annealed statistical properties for conservative IID random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several theorems relating annealed exponential mixing of the two-point motion with quenched properties of the one-point motion for conservative IID random dynamical systems. In particular, we show that annealed exponential mixing of the two-point motion implies quenched exponential mixing of the one-point motion. We also show that if the two-point motion satisfies annealed exponential mixing and the annealed central limit theorem with polynomial rate of convergence, then the one-point motion satisfies a quenched CLT. These results hold for all H\"older and Sobolev spaces of positive index.</description>

      <title>On approximating the $f$-divergence between two Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $f$-divergence is a fundamental notion that measures the difference between two distributions. In this paper, we study the problem of approximating the $f$-divergence between two Ising models, which is a generalization of recent work on approximating the TV-distance. Given two Ising models $\nu$ and $\mu$, which are specified by their interaction matrices and external fields, the problem is to approximate the $f$-divergence $D_f(\nu\,\|\,\mu)$ within an arbitrary relative error $\mathrm{e}^{\pm \varepsilon}$. For $\chi^\alpha$-divergence with a constant integer $\alpha$, we establish both algorithmic and hardness results. The algorithm works in a parameter regime that matches the hardness result. Our algorithm can be extended to other $f$-divergences such as $\alpha$-divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence, R\'enyi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>Partializations of Markov categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work develops a construction of a CD category of partial kernels from a particular type of Markov category called a partializable Markov category. These are a generalization of earlier models of categories of partial morphisms such as p-categories, dominical categories, restriction categories, etc. to a non-deterministic/non-cartesian setting. Here all morphisms are quasi-total, with a natural poset enrichment corresponding to one morphism being a restriction of the other. Furthermore, various properties important to categorical probability are preserved, such as positivity, representability, conditionals, Kolmogorov products, and splittings of idempotents. We additionally discuss an alternative notion of Kolmogorov product suitable for partial maps, as well as partial algebras for probability monads.
  The primary example is that of the partialization of the category of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels. Other examples include variants where the distributions are finitely supported, or where one considers multivalued maps instead.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and local weak convergence of sparse random uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of local weak convergence, also known as Benjamini--Schramm convergence, was introduced by Benjamini and Schramm \cite{Benjamini-Schramm-convergence}. It is known that the local weak limit of sparse Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs is the Galton--Watson measure with Poisson offspring almost surely. Recently, Adhikari, Kumar and Saha \cite{adhikari2023spectrumrandomsimplicialcomplexes} showed that the local weak limit of the line graph of sparse Linial--Meshulam complexes is the $d$-block Galton--Watson measure almost surely. In this work, we study the local weak convergence of a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform random hypergraphs.
  Let $H(n,k,p)$ denote the $k$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices, where each $k$-set of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with probability $p$. For $1\le r\le k-1$, the $r$-set weighted line graph of $H=(V,E)$ is $G_r(H)=(\mathcal V_r,\mathcal E_r,w_H)$, with \[ \mathcal V_r=\l[\binom{n}{r}\r],\;\; \mathcal E_r=\{\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}\suchthat \tau_1,\tau_2\in\mathcal V_r, \exists e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}, \] and $w_H(\{\tau_1,\tau_2\})=|\{e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}|$. In particular, $G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\H os--R\'enyi graphs, while $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the line graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if $\binom{n-r}{k-r}\to \lambda$ as $n\to\infty$, then the local weak limit of $G_r(H_n)$ is the $(\binom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with Poisson$(\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the limiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Cubature Formulas on Wiener Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on techniques developed by Lyons and Victoir, we present the first explicit construction of a degree-7 cubature formula for Wiener space over $\mathbb{R}^3$. We then examine and compare two approaches for computing cubature approximations: one based on the stochastic Taylor expansion and the other on the Log-ODE method. Our numerical experiments illustrate how the cubature degree influences the order of convergence and demonstrate the utility of cubature methods for weak approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These results were originally part of a Master's thesis and are provided here as context and a reference point for subsequent work. A more general construction in arbitrary dimensions has since been obtained by Ferrucci, Herschell, Litterer and Lyons arXiv:2411.13707 using different techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1604.00056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentration inequalities, which prove to be very useful in a variety of fields, provide fairly tight bounds for large deviation probability while central limit theorem (CLT) describes the asymptotic distribution around the mean (within scope of $\sqrt{n}$ order). Harris (1963) conjectured that for a supercritical branching random walk (BRW) of i.i.d offspring and iid displacement, population's positions in $nth$ generation approach to Gaussian distribution -- central limit theorem. This conjecture was latter proved by Stam (1966) and Kaplan and Asmussen (1976). Refinements and extensions followed. Yet little effort is known on large deviation probability for BRW. In this note, we suggest and verify a more general and probably more formal setting of BRW. Benefiting from this framework, a Chernoff bound for BRW is immediately obtained. The relation between RW (random walk) and BRW is addressed.</description>

      <title>Anomalous geodesics in the inhomogeneous corner growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Busemann functions, semi-infinite geodesics, and competition interfaces in the exactly solvable last-passage percolation with inhomogeneous exponential weights. New phenomena concerning geodesics arise due to inhomogeneity. These include novel Busemann functions associated with flat regions of the limit shape and thin rectangles, undirected semi-infinite geodesics, non-trivial axis-directed geodesics, intervals with no geodesic directions, and isolated geodesic directions. We further observe a new dichotomy for competition interfaces and second-class customers in a series of memoryless continuous-time queues with inhomogeneous service rates: a second class customer either becomes trapped or proceeds through the queue at strictly positive speed.</description>

      <title>Alice and Bob on $\Bbb X$: reversal, coupling, renewal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A neat question involving coin flips surfaced on $\Bbb X$, and generated an intensive `storm' of `social mathematics'. In a sequence of flips of a fair coin, Alice wins a point at each appearance of two consecutive heads, and Bob wins a point whenever a head is followed immediately by a tail. Who is more likely to win the game? The subsequent discussion illustrated conflicting intuitions, and concluded with the correct answer (it is a close thing). It is explained here why the context of the question is interesting and how it may be answered in a quantitative manner using the probabilistic techniques of reversal, coupling, and renewal.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits for Exponential Hedging in the Brownian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scaling limits of exponential utility indifference prices for European contingent claims in the Bachelier model. We show that the scaling limit can be represented in terms of the \emph{specific relative entropy}, and in addition we construct asymptotic optimal hedging strategies. To prove the upper bound for the limit, we formulate the dual problem as a stochastic control, and show there exists a classical solution to its Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The proof for the lower bound relies on the duality result for exponential hedging in discrete time.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for non-Hermitian Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginibre ensemble for either fixed or proportional rectangularity indexes. The joint distribution of the eigenvalue moduli for the complex Ginibre ensemble is derived in this paper. It is equal to the joint distribution of independent random variables, each following a Gamma-Rayleigh distribution. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of extreme eigenvalue of Ginibre ensembles to Gumbel distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a real $(\beta=1)$ or complex $(\beta=2)$ Ginibre ensemble. Let $\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X,$ and $Z_n$ be some rescaled version of $\max_i \Re \sigma_i.$ It was proved that $Z_n$ converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda_{\beta}$ with distribution function $e^{-\frac{\beta}{2}e^{-x}}.$ We further prove that
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Z_n \leq x)-e^{-\frac{\beta}{2}e^{-x}}|=\frac{25\log \log n}{4e \log n}(1+o(1))$$
  and
  $$ W_1\left(\mathcal{L}(Z_n), \Lambda_{\beta}\right)=\frac{25\log \log n}{4\log n}(1+o(1))$$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $\mathcal{L}(Z_n)$ is the distribution of $Z_n$ and $W_1$ is the Wasserstein distance. Similar results hold for $\max_{i} |\sigma_i|.$ Furthermore, the convergence rates of the complex Ginibre ensemble are universal for complex iid random matrices under certain moment conditions on entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume. We show that under a weakly asymmetric scaling, their solutions converge to that of the KPZ equation. The result holds for a large class of potentials, nonlinearities, and essentially any (non-equilibrium) initial data for the limit KPZ equation. The main technical innovation is the analysis of a stochastic heat kernel for the SPDE of interest.</description>

      <title>KPZ equation from open ASEP with general boundary asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generalizations of open ASEP in the interval and half-space, where the speed of the reservoir dynamics can depend on the local particle configuration. We show that their height functions have a continuum limit given by the open KPZ equation. This removes the assumption of Liggett's condition in Corwin-Shen '18 and Parekh '19, thus answering a question of Corwin '22 and Himwich '25, and it removes the assumption of product invariant measures in Goncalves-Perkowski-Simon '20. In the case of the interval, we also show convergence of the stationary measure for the height function increment process to that of the increment process for the open KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Repetition and recurrence times: Dual statements and summable mixing rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14703v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By an analogy to the duality between the recurrence time and the longest match length, we introduce a quantity dual to the maximal repetition length, which we call the repetition time. Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The upper bound holds if the mixing rate $\phi(n)$ is summable, whereas the lower bound only assumes stationarity. Our reasoning makes a repeated use of dualities between so-called times and so-called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</description>

      <title>Metrization of Gromov-Hausdorff-type topologies on boundedly-compact metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new general framework for metrization of Gromov-Hausdorff-type topologies on non-compact metric spaces. We also give easy-to-check conditions for separability and completeness and hence the measure theoretic requirements are provided to study convergence of random spaces with additional random objects. In particular, our framework enables us to define a metric inducing a suitable Gromov-Hausdorff-type topology on the space of rooted boundedly-compact metric spaces with laws of stochastic processes and/or random fields, which was not clear how to do in previous frameworks. In addition to general theory, this paper includes several examples of Gromov-Hausdorff-type topologies, verifying that classical examples such as the Gromov-Hausdorff topology and the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov topology are contained within our framework.</description>

      <title>Connecting SPDE to SGMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) derived from the Fokker-Planck equation associated with Score-based Generative Models. We modify the standard Fokker-Planck equation to better represent practical SGMs and introduce noise to mitigate potential discretization issues. The primary goal is to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for this SPDE. This aspect requires careful consideration due to the time-dependent operator and unbounded domain. To overcome these hurdles, we employ a variational approach and introduce a novel space inspired by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators. By demonstrating that this space and its subspace satisfy the necessary assumptions, they establish the existence of a solution for the given SPDE.</description>

      <title>Test Set Sizing for the Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish except for m and the number of features, n, which is held constant. This is the first time that such a split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first two terms asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Quality control in sublinear time: a case study via random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms are designed to work well on average over inputs. When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.
  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by acquiring the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. Furthermore, the number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps: we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>
