      <title>Categorical Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Intersecting Branes and Consistent Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore consistent truncations from 10d/11d supergravity to supergravity theories on brane worldvolumes. Supersymmetric black-brane solutions to these lower-dimensional theories can be uplifted to 10d/11d supergravity and interpreted as intersecting-brane solutions with a particular smearing pattern. We survey this novel family of intersecting-brane solutions which also includes cases that are not related to previously known consistent truncations. Turning the argument on its head, we argue that the knowledge of such solutions allows us to generate appropriate embedding ans\"atze for consistent truncations. We demonstrate this by deriving new consistent embeddings of pure 5d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity on D4-branes in type IIA theory and of pure 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity on NS5-branes in type IIB theory.</description>

      <title>The SymTFT of $u(N)$ Yang-Mills Theory and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a SymTFT for 4d $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory and its variants. We show that the SymTFT reproduces the structure of the global one-form symmetry in these theories. We consider the holographic embedding of this SymTFT, and observe that SymTFT's containing continuous symmetries are not always obtained as a near boundary limit of the supergravity action.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling amplitudes and Hawking radiation from worldline QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare Hawking radiation in a collapse background with Schwinger pair creation in an electric field. The comparison is driven by the presence of an analogue horizon in the Schwinger case, which causally divides spacetime for classical particles, but through which quantum fields can tunnel. Amplitudes for tunnelling processes are encoded in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the appropriate background-coupled wave equation. We construct these solutions, in both gravity and QED, using the worldline approach, where tunnelling and particle creation manifest as complex saddle points of a real-time path integral. For the Schwinger effect, these saddles correspond to complex worldlines, while for Hawking radiation, the corresponding worldlines are real, but appear complex when extended beyond a certain coordinate patch.</description>

      <title>Radiation in Fluid/Gravity and the Flat Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the super-Poynting vector, which we reinterpret holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian analogue of the super-Poynting vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Quantum Connections: Assessing the Viability of Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01487v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m &gt; (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M )_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon if \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) that ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled. Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their agreement when these parameters are present.</description>

      <title>Thermal and quantum phase transitions in a holographic anisotropic Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we build a phenomenological, strongly
  coupled quantum field theory in $2+1$-dimensions through AdS/CFT holography,
  by building a $3+1$-dimensional, negatively curved gravity theory with a $SU(2)$ gauge field,
  and a scalar field in the adjoint of $SU(2)$. We locate a phase transition between two distinct phases at zero and finite temperature, which
  are characterized through the dispersion relation of quasi-normal modes of probe fermions in the bulk,
  and correspond either to a Dirac semimetal or a band insulator. These phases are separated by a
  critical phase/critical point (depending if $T&gt;0$ or $T=0$, respectively) where the band structure
  of boundary fermions exhibits semi-Dirac anisotropy. We
  characterize each phase at $T=0$ by explicit solutions to the bulk equations of motion in the infra-red,
  and determine that the critical point's spacetime is a Lifshitz geometry, whose dynamical critical exponent is
  approximately equal to $2$. We also find that this anisotropy induces a non-trivial
  scaling of the shear viscosity-entropy density ratio with respect to temperature in the $T\to 0$ limit, and find evidence
  that the anisotropic phase of the system corresponds to a finite-temperature quantum critical phase.</description>

      <title>Extended thermodynamical topology of black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamical topology has emerged as a powerful framework for classifying the thermodynamical behavior of black holes. Three distinct yet complementary topological invariants have been employed to characterize black hole phases, spinodal curves, and critical points in black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we develop a unified framework that integrates these three topological approaches and introduce the concept of extended thermodynamical topology, providing a clear physical interpretation. As a first step, we apply this framework to black holes in Einstein gravity, systematically elucidating their phase structure in terms of topological invariants. We then extend our analysis to black holes in 7-dimensional Lovelock gravity, where novel thermodynamic phenomena naturally emerge from the topological perspective. Moreover, we explore the connection between critical exponents and the extended thermodynamical topology, uncovering a correspondence between the zeros of the $k$-th order vector field and the associated critical exponents. Our study demonstrates that extended thermodynamical topology offers a robust and fine-grained framework for analyzing and classifying black hole phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Topology in Holographic Mean-Field Theory at Zero and Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological invariants in strongly interacting many-body systems within holographic mean-field theory (H-MFT) framework. Analytic expressions for retarded Green's functions are obtained for all possible fermionic bilinear interactions in the limit of probe background limit $\mathrm{AdS}_4$, from which we construct topological Hamiltonians. Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems. We point out why topological number is defined in the holographic theories while it is not in the perturbative field theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic symmetry algebra for the MHV sector revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic symmetry algebra in the MHV sector. We find an infinite dimensional Abelian symmetry algebra whose generators are the conformally soft negative helicity gravitons and gluons. So the complete symmetry algebra in the MHV graviton sector is a semideirect product of the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. Similarly in the MHV gluon sector the symmetry algebra is a semidirect product of the $S$ algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. The extended symmetry algebra has some use. For example, it is known for sometime that an $n$ point MHV amplitude satisfies $(n-2)$ Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) type equations. So two equations are missing. We show that the extended symmetry algebra has additional null states whose decoupling give rise to the two missing equations.</description>

      <title>Stationary Solution to Charged Hairy Black Hole in AdS4: Kasner Interior, Rotating Shock Waves, and Fast Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field. Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries, vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time and the Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay.</description>

      <title>Physical implications of four dimensional braided noncommutative gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of gravity theories on noncommutative (NC) spacetimes has been an active area of research for some time. Various models and methods have been proposed in the literature. Even within the star-product formalism, there are several distinct approaches to constructing NC deformations of General Relativity (GR) and Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (ECP) gravity. Some models are based on the NC local Lorentz symmetry, while others rely on NC deformations of the diffeomorphism symmetry of GR. In this paper, we investigate the connection between two NC gravity models based on twisted and braided NC diffeomorphism symmetry. Although these two models yield different NC gravity actions, we show that, in certain cases, they lead to the same phenomenological consequences. In particular, they share identical three-graviton vertex and exhibit some simple common vacuum solutions. This work represents a step towards understanding the diverse landscape of NC gravity models constructed within the star-product framework.</description>

      <title>Exact CHY Integrand Construction Using Combinatorial Neural Networks and Discrete Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the inverse CHY problem-constructing integrands from desired pole structures-by establishing a correspondence between CHY combinatorics and Combinatorial Neural Networks (CNNs). Our key innovation is the generalized pole degree $K(s_A)$, which is additive under integrand multiplication and satisfies hierarchical recursion relations. These recursions naturally map to CNN message-passing architectures, enabling discrete automatic differentiation that preserves exact integer constraints throughout the computation. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that yield numerical approximations, our method leverages the intrinsic combinatorial structure of the CHY formalism to guarantee exact algebraic solutions. This work demonstrates how specialized neural architectures can solve fundamental physics problems requiring strict mathematical constraints, providing a modest step toward bridging combinatorics, machine learning, and scattering amplitude theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some recent results regarding the formulation of mixed ensembles of oriented and nonoriented center vortices based on the Weingarten representation for the sum over surfaces. This framework enabled a partition function for the Abelian-projected ensemble of vortex worldsurfaces, previously formulated as a wavefunctional peaked at center-vortex loops. In particular, we showed how an Abelian ensemble can account for $N$-ality while supporting a ``dual superconductor'' model for confinement. This formulation also clarified the description of the Goldstone modes for percolating surfaces with non-Abelian degrees of freedom, used in the original mechanism for the formation of a confining flux tube due to the percolating mixed ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants expressed through correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form an infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. It turns out that such a 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, the number of generators can be infinite. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for a $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is an open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $\leq k$ Vassiliev invariants. Again, we have only examples of a set of $k$ Vassiliev invariants being a complete invariant of a $k$-parametric knot family. Currently, it is unknown whether a set of a fewer number of Vassiliev invariants cannot be a complete knot family invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</description>

      <title>Summing over homology groups of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of a 3-dimensional topological quantum gravity. In this model, a contribution of a given 3-manifold is given by the partition function of an abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), with a topological boundary condition at the boundary. Using the fact that the TQFT partition function depends only on the first homology group of the 3-manifold with some additional structure, the sum over all 3-manifolds with fixed boundary can be rewritten as a sum over finitely generated abelian groups (and the extra structure). We present bounds on the universal weights in the sum, that is, the measure on the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated abelian groups (with the extra structure) sufficient for the sum to be convergent. Moreover, with further assumptions on the measure, we argue the existence of a distribution of 2d TQFTs, such that the sum is equal to the ensemble average of their partition functions evaluated on the boundary. For a certain kind of measure, the sum over the abelian groups can be factorized into sums over abelian $p$-groups, and the analysis can be performed independently for each prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects in conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).</description>

      <title>Quantum variational calculus on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the long-standing problem of variational calculus on a noncommutative space or spacetime for a significant class of models with trivial jet bundle. Our approach entails a quantum version of the Anderson variational double complex $\Omega(J^\infty)$ and includes Euler-Lagrange equations and a partial Noether's theorem. We show in detail how this works for a free field on a $\Bbb Z^m$ lattice regarded as a discrete noncommutative geometry, obtaining the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field, including with a general metric and gauge field background, as the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for an action. In the case of a flat metric we also obtain an exactly on-shell conserved stress-energy tensor and Noether charges for a scalar field on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Bosonization, BTZ Black Hole Microstates, and Logarithmic Correction to Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant under non-standard boundary conditions where chemical potentials are determined dynamically. Using a boundary Hamiltonian inspired by collective field theory (ColFT), the boundary dynamics reduce to those of a one-dimensional fluid on a circle, with configurations corresponding to bulk geometries such as BTZ black holes. Quantizing the system via bosonization of relativistic fermions, we obtain a microscopic description of black hole states in terms of Young diagrams, whose degeneracies match the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute the Euclidean canonical partition function and free energy for both the ColFT Hamiltonian and a relativistic free-fermion Hamiltonian. In the ColFT case, the partition function resembles that of chiral U(N) Yang-Mills theory on a torus, with N~1/(\beta G). This offers a novel way to compute quantum corrections to the partition function. The leading entropy term receives contributions from all genera, while the subleading logarithmic correction is one-loop exact, arising solely from the genus-one sector with coefficient -1/2 . This coefficient remains unchanged in the relativistic fermion case, suggesting the universality of the one-loop correction across different boundary Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Super-Penrose $\And$ Witten Transforms for SCFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of three dimensional CFT correlators in twistor space has recently garnered a significant interest. Conformal symmetry acts linearly in the twistor space, which streamlines the analysis. Moreover, twistors provide a connection to the position and momentum space through the Penrose and Witten transforms, respectively. In this work, we develop the supersymmetric versions of Penrose and Witten transforms for three dimensional superconformal field theories for $\mathcal{N}=1\;\textrm{to}\;4$. We derive two and three point functions in the position and momentum superspace for the $\mathcal{N}=1$ scenario using these transforms. Extending this setup to higher supersymmetries turns out to be a simple extension of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ case, which aligns with the inherent simplicity of supertwistors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly find an exact spherically symmetric solution in quadratic non-metricity gravity. We show that the quadratic term acts as a cosmological constant. This solution contradicts all the claims in the literature that there is no spherically symmetric solution for higher-order non-metricity gravity. Moreover, we demonstrate that for the charged field equations, the solution can be identical to the non-charged case. This is because the off-diagonal components of the field equation do not feel the effect of the charge.</description>

      <title>On the Edge of Safety: Charge-Charge Correlation in the Back-to-Back Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Charge-Charge Correlation (QQC) in electron-positron annihilation as a probe of charge dynamics in Quantum Chromodynamics. While generally divergent beyond leading order, we show that the QQC is infrared and collinear safe in the back-to-back limit, a property that we dub leading-power safety. This enables an analytic perturbative treatment that bypasses the reliance on non-perturbative track or fragmentation functions. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Field Theory, we derive a factorization theorem and determine its logarithmic behavior analytically up to four loops in QCD, uncovering remarkable connections with the Energy-Energy Correlation (EEC). Prior to this work, the behavior of the QQC beyond leading order was entirely unknown; we now establish its resummation to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^4$LL) accuracy, placing it among the observables with the highest perturbative precision alongside the EEC. Our results are validated through a numerical analysis using Event2, exhibiting excellent agreement with the predicted singular terms. This work establishes the QQC as a novel, calculable probe of charge dynamics and unveils a new window into the inner workings of non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>The Order of the Monster Finite Simple Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the order of the largest of the twenty-six sporadic simple groups known as the Monster, using a straightforward computational approach. The Monster is here defined as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the 196884-dimensional Griess algebra generated by a group of type $2^{1+24}_+.Co_1$ and an additional triality automorphism. Our approach is based on counting arguments for certain idempotents of the Griess algebra called axes. Our proof is self-contained, requiring only established properties of the Conway group as the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and some of its subgroups.
  Although our approach is conceptually simple, it requires extensive calculation inside a 196884-dimensional matrix group that current computer algebra systems cannot easily handle directly. Instead, we use the software package mmgroup, developed by the second author, which supports fast calculations inside the Monster. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first self-contained computation of the order of the Monster.
  The Monster also acts on the Moonshine module V^#, which is a vertex operator algebra of central charge c=24. We provide a new proof that the Monster is the full automorphism group of the Griess algebra and of the Moonshine module using Borcherds' proof of the Monstrous Moonshine conjectures. In addition, we show that the Monster has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. The order of the Baby Monster, the second largest of the sporadic simple groups, is also determined.</description>

      <title>Moment problems and bounds for matrix-valued smeared spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical analytic continuation arises frequently in lattice field theory, particularly in spectroscopy problems. This work shows the equivalence of common spectroscopic problems to certain classes of moment problems that have been studied thoroughly in the mathematical literature. Mathematical results due to Kovalishina enable rigorous bounds on smeared matrix-valued spectral functions, which are implemented numerically for the first time. The required input is a positive-definite matrix of Euclidean-time correlation functions; such matrices are routinely computed in variational spectrum studies using lattice quantum chromodynamics. This work connects the moment-problem perspective to recent developments using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and Lanczos algorithm. Possible limitations due to finite numerical precision are discussed.</description>

      <title>Implications of a dark grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that dark matter and normal matter are nontrivially unified in a grand unified theory, called dark grand unification, we derive novel residual theories at low energy explaining dark matter and neutrino mass. The first chain of which is $E_6\to SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes SU(3)_R$, which contains a matter parity by itself stabilizing a dark matter candidate and producing neutrino mass via a seesaw. The second chain is $\mathrm{Trinification}\to SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$, which results in a novel family-universal 3-3-1-1 model, opposite to the normal 3-3-1-1 (or corresponding 3-3-1) model. Surprisingly, it is a variant of both minimal 3-3-1 model and 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos since both $e_R$ and $\nu_R$ are located at the bottoms of lepton triplets. Since this universal 3-3-1-1 model is properly embedded in the trinification, the above matter parity works governing dark matter stability as well as suppressing unwanted fermion mixings. Further, neutrino masses are naturally generated by a canonical seesaw too.</description>

      <title>The Philosophy and Physics of Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Penrose Process in Rotating Black Holes with Quantum Corrections: Implications for Energy Extraction and Irreducible Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole spacetime modified by a quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Focusing on particle splitting within the ergoregion, we analyze the Penrose process and compute the extraction efficiency \( \eta \) as a function of both the spin parameter \( a \) and the quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Our results show that increasing \( \alpha \) induces an inward shift of the event horizon and the static limit, resulting in a modest expansion of the ergoregion. This geometric change significantly enhances the energy extraction potential. By numerically solving the horizon equation, we determine a maximum extraction efficiency of 11.64\%. Additionally, we derive the expression for the irreducible mass, highlighting its fundamental role in constraining the amount of extractable rotational energy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that quantum corrections have a substantial impact on black hole energetics, leading to marked deviations from predictions based on classical Kerr theory.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Chemistry: the first 15 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of thermodynamics into gravitational physics began 5 decades ago with the discovery that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems once semiclassical quantum effects are taken into account. Notions of temperature, entropy, work, and phase changes that were introduced into gravitational physics and originally applied to black holes, were later extended to cosmological horizons and other settings as well. A major development occurred 15 years ago with the introduction of pressure in the form of a cosmological constant. By extending the thermodynamic phase space to include this term, along with its conjugate volume, black holes were found to exhibit a broad variety of phase transitions that resembled phenomena seen in chemistry labs. Black hole thermodynamics has become Black Hole Chemistry, which has led to a wealth of insights into the nature of black holes, introducing concepts such as Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points into gravitational physics. I discuss the origins of Black Hole Chemistry and its basic features covered in an earlier review [1], and then go on to describe developments in the subject that have taken place since then. Examples include multicritical behaviour, polymeric transitions, superfluid transitions, scalar hair, heat engines, NUT-charge, acceleration thermodynamics, the Joule-Thompson expansion, holography, complexity, central charge criticality, microstructure, thermodynamic tension, phase dynamics, and thermodynamic topology. This wealth of new phenomena suggest that we likely still have a lot to learn from Black Hole Chemistry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Polynomial Hybrid Inflation: Planck and ACT Compatibility via Radiative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of one-loop radiative corrections in a non-supersymmetric model of hybrid inflation with a chaotic (polynomial-like) potential,$V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p$, in the light of the latest constraints from \textit{Planck} and \textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope} (ACT) observations. Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and $\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$. These corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other matter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level, the predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational bounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the potential to, \[ V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p + A \phi^4 \ln (\phi/ \mu), \] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other fields, and \(\mu\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively corrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined \textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in this work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A &lt; 0$) suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s &lt; 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions. This brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still allowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and naturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework for inflation and baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon from the chiral effective model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the confining pressure and associated global property, i.e, D-term, of the nucleon using the skyrmion approach formulated within scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. In this framework, the nucleon is modeled as a skyrmion, and a scalar meson is introduced to incorporate the effects of the scale anomaly via low-energy theorems. The contributions from the current quark mass and gluonic dynamics to the scale anomaly are encoded through the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively. By decomposing the nucleon's energy-momentum tensor, we isolate the anomalous components and analyze their role in generating pressure. We find that the gluonic contribution to the scale anomaly plays a dominant role in producing confining pressure. In comparison with results from conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, the total pressure derived from sChPT provides improved qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results. We also evaluate the D-term and compare it with recent lattice and model-independent determinations.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on f(R,T) gravity coupled with NED from Black Hole Quasi Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and $f(R,T)$ gravity on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around a magnetically charged black hole. By analyzing the effective potential, specific energy, and angular momentum of circular orbits, we study how the NED parameter $\alpha$ and the gravitational coupling parameter $\beta$ affect orbital dynamics. Increasing $\alpha$ leads to systematic deviations from the Reissner Nordstrom behavior, reflected in shifts in the ISCO radius and orbital frequencies. We further explore QPO-generating radii using the Relativistic Precession (RP), Warped Disk (WD), and Epicyclic Resonance (ER2-ER4) models. We further extend our analysis by performing an MCMC-based parameter estimation using QPO data from black holes spanning a wide range of mass scales. This approach yields consistent observational constraints on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Coulomb-Corrected Wormhole Model for Neon-20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the spatial wormhole geometry proposed by Manton and Dunajski, we develop a modified model for the Neon-20 nucleus that incorporates a repulsive Coulomb potential. This reduces the large threshold energy for cluster break-up in the original model and converts most bound states to resonances. We use generalized WKB methods to calculate the energies of bound states, and also the energies and widths of under-barrier and over-barrier resonances. The results align closely with experimental data for the 0_1^+ , 0_1^- and 0_4^+ rotational bands of Neon-20, including the large widths in the higher-nodal 0_4^+ band.</description>

      <title>Jet-mass in V/H+jet up to four-loops with $k_t$ clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the work of [1] to the case in which final-state jets, produced in association with a Higgs or vector boson, are defined using the $k_t$ algorithm. We thereby compute the full distribution of the invariant mass squared of the leading, highest-$p_t$ jet, including both clustering and non-global logarithms, up to four-loops in perturbation theory. Our results are derived within the eikonal approximation under the assumption of strong ordering in the momenta of the final-state partons, and are consequently valid up to single-logarithmic accuracy. The final semi-analytical expressions retain the complete dependence on both colour and the jet radius. The broad features of $k_t$ clustering observed in $e^+ e^-$ processes persist in hadronic collisions, together with novel characteristics that are absent in the $e^+ e^-$ environment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).</description>

      <title>Holographic spectroscopy of fermion with instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic spectroscopy in the D(-1)-D3 brane system. The background geometry of this system described by IIB supergravity includes a black (deconfined) and bubble (confined) D3-brane which corresponds respectively to a deconfined and a confined gauge theory in holography. The charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate in this model. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then the fermionic spectrum in the confined case is obtained by decomposing the fermion with dimensional reduction. In addition, by using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results in the deconfined case illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. In the confined case, the holographic correlation function indicates several separated dispersion curves which illustrates consistently the onset mass in the fermionic spectrum we obtained. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermion in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bootstrap the leading order hadronic contribution to $a_\mu$ using unitarity, analytic properties, crossing symmetry and finite energy sum rules (FESR) from quantum chromodynamics (QCD), establishing a lower bound. Combining this lower bound with the remaining precisely calculated contributions from quantum electrodynamics and electroweak interactions, we achieve a lower bound on muon anomaly $a_\mu$. Since the FESRs have uncertainties, our bound depends on the choices of FESRs within these uncertainties. A conservative choice of the FESR gives a conservative lower bound, consistent with Standard Model (SM) data-driven prediction. We show that there are other valid choices of FESRs within the uncertainties that lead to lower bounds, which are inconsistent with SM data-driven prediction but consistent with the measured values of the muon anomaly. The bootstrapped spectral density shows a $\rho$-resonance peak similar to experimental hadronic cross-ratio data, providing a bootstrap prediction for $\rho$-meson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of compact self-dual solitons in the restricted gauged baby Skyrme model in the presence of an external magnetic field. The consistent implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism depends on the relative size between the compacton and the effective region occupied by the external magnetic field. To address this issue, we consider two scenarios: in the first, the external magnetic field is confined within the compacton, effectively playing the role of a magnetic impurity; in the second scenario, the external magnetic field fully encircles the compacton. For both cases, the approach has enabled us to set the self-dual potential, achieve the Bogomol'ny bound for the energy, and establish the self-dual or BPS equations whose solutions saturate such a bound. We next focused on obtaining radially symmetric compactons by solving the BPS system using two functions to describe the external magnetic field, a step-type function and a Gaussian function. After solving the BPS system numerically, we depicted the resulting field profiles and highlighted the effects induced on the compacton's size, field profiles, magnetic field, and magnetic flux.</description>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations of the spacetime metric induce an uncertainty in the horizon area of a black hole. Working in linearized quantum gravity, we derive the variance in the area of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole from the renormalized graviton propagator. We find that the standard deviation of the horizon area scales as the product of the Schwarzschild radius and the Planck length. For macroscopic black holes, the quantum uncertainty is therefore enormous in Planck units.</description>

      <title>The Massive Flat Space Limit of Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they can be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due to their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that momentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific singularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after analytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that the amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated flat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are effectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS) limit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman graph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light external legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this limit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero in inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We present a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in terms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the deep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and the properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy fields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions from heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed regime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover, which are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be reproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field inflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially non-local operators into the EFT.</description>

Abstract: We discuss and extend some aspects pertaining to the canonical quantisation of JT gravity in de Sitter space, including the problem of time and the construction of a Hilbert space. We then extend this discussion to other two dimensional models obtained by changing the dilaton potential and show that the canonical quantisation procedure can be carried out for a large class of such models. Some discussion leading towards a path integral understanding for states, other than the Hartle Hawking state, is also included here, along with comments pertaining to Holography and the entropy of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Double-Scaled SYK, QCD, and the Flat Space Limit of de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surprising connection exists between double-scaled SYK at infinite temperature, and large N QCD. The large N expansions of the two theories have the same form; the 't Hooft limit of QCD parallels the fixed p limit of SYK (for a theory with p-fermion interactions), and the limit of fixed gauge coupling g -- the flat space limit in AdS/CFT -- parallels the double-scaled limit of SYK. From the holographic perspective fixed g is the far more interesting limit of gauge theory, but very little is known about it. DSSYK allows us to explore it in a more tractable example. The connection is illustrated by perturbative and non-perturbative DSSYK calculations, and comparing the results with known properties of Yang Mills theory. The correspondence is largely independent of the conjectured duality between DSSYK and de Sitter space, but may have a good deal to tell us about it.</description>

Abstract: We examine a scattering process in which a set of particles come together, interact through a long-range massless scalar force like dilaton mediated and then disperse. Using worldline formalism, we compute the trajectories of the scattered particles and derive an infinite series of subleading terms in the late-time and early-time expansion of the scalar waveform. We study the scalar waveform, the scalar memory term and classical soft scalar theorems. We ignore gravitational interactions and discuss the challenges if we include it.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Curves and Transitions in 5d SQFTs via Defects and Blowup Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate codimension-2 defect partition functions and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves in 5d rank-1 supersymmetric QFTs, including non-Lagrangian and Kaluza-Klein theories. Using generalized blowup equations, we compute defect partition functions in the $\Omega$-background and show that, in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, they satisfy certain difference equations that encode the quantization of classical Seiberg-Witten curves. Furthermore, we explore novel transitions in the defect partition functions and their relation to coordinate transformations of quantum Seiberg-Witten curves, with a focus on SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) transformations and Hanany-Witten transitions. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between codimension-2 defects, quantum curves, and the geometric structure of 5d supersymmetric QFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space of invariants for a single matrix is generated by traces containing at most $N$ matrices per trace. We extend this analysis to multi-matrix models at finite $N$. Using the Molien-Weyl formula, we compute partition functions for various multi-matrix models at different $N$ and interpret them through trace relations. This allows us to identify a complete set of invariants, naturally divided into two distinct classes: primary and secondary. The full invariant ring of the multi-matrix model is reconstructed via the Hironaka decomposition, where primary invariants act freely, while secondary invariants satisfy quadratic relations. Significantly, while traces with at most $N$ matrices are always present, we also find invariants involving more than $N$ matrices per trace. The primary invariants correspond to perturbative degrees of freedom, whereas the secondary invariants emerge as non-trivial background structures. The growth of secondary invariants aligns with expectations from black hole entropy, suggesting deep structural connections to gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Unified Equation for Massless Spin Particles and New Spin Coefficient Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals or exploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves, black hole perturbation theory proves indispensable. At the heart of developing a universal perturbation framework for such problems lies the challenge of formulating a coordinate-independent, unified wave equation that is universally applicable to any black hole spacetime. This paper resolves this central issue in type-D spacetimes by establishing a new definition of spin coefficients. Specifically, we introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\rho$, $\mu$, $\tau$, and $\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of the logarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\mu}$, $n^{\mu}$, $m^{\mu}$, $\bar{m}^{\mu}$), respectively. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. Using the newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary type-D black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This finding is particularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is already a significant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate spacetime around black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new definition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the unified equation for nearly all known type-D black hole backgrounds. This lays a solid foundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any type-D black hole background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We write the Lagrangian of a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor in a covariant form. Then, based on an analogy with the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model and by employing the Fierz transformations, we demonstrate that new collective modes should exist in such a system, including a pseudo-scalar Nambu-Goldstone boson and its corresponding amplitude mode plus a vector and an axial-vector collective mode. It is also observed that the pseudo-scalar mode can become massive due to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian. Analogous to pions in low-energy QCD, such a massive pseudo-scalar mode can decay via the axial anomaly.</description>

      <title>Unifying Cosmic Epochs via Quantum-Corrected Expansion with Brane-World Parallels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact, non-perturbative and non-singular ansatz for the universe's expansion history through a novel analytic scale factor, $a(t)=e^{H(t)} { (1-e^{-k(t)t}) }^{b(t)}$, which reproduces the observed sequence of cosmic epochs and bridges inflation to late-time acceleration, as a unified solution, eliminating ad hoc $\Lambda$CDM epoch splicing. The model's dynamically constrained parameters $(H(t), k(t), b(t))$ ensure smooth phase transitions, as confirmed by analytical and numerical analysis of the expansion history.
  The derived Hubble parameter incorporates quantum-inspired corrections through its functional form, offering a phenomenological approach to integrate quantum effects into classical cosmic evolution. While not derived from fundamental theory, it provides a well motivated framework within brane inspired cosmology with structure exhibiting parallels to brane-world scenarios: the parameter $k(t)$ acts as an effective screening scale, and the non-monotonic $k(t)t$ implies epoch-dependent gravitational coupling. The scaling relation $\sim \rho(t)\lambda(t)$ emerges naturally, offering a unified description of constant and variable-tension brane-like behavior at the phenomenological level.</description>

      <title>Simple holographic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model &amp; the fate of KMS symmetry for non-hydrodynamic modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion, as described by Fick's laws, governs the spreading of particles, information, data, and even financial fluctuations. However, due to its parabolic structure, the diffusion equation leads to an unphysical prediction: any localized disturbance instantaneously affects the entire system. The Maxwell-Cattaneo (MC) model, originally introduced to address relativistic heat conduction, refines the standard diffusion framework by incorporating a finite relaxation time $\tau$, associated with the onset of local equilibrium. This modification yields physically relevant consequences, including the emergence of propagating shear waves in liquids and second sound in solids. Holographic methods have historically provided powerful tools for describing the hydrodynamics of strongly correlated systems. However, they have so far failed to capture the dynamics governed by the MC model, limiting their ability to model intermediate time-scale phenomena. In this work, we construct a simple holographic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model and rigorously establish its equivalence through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. As an important byproduct of our analysis, and contrary to previous ad-hoc assumptions, we find that effective field theories featuring non-hydrodynamic modes exhibit a generalized form of Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry, which reduces to the canonical form only in the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the limit of infinite radius de Sitter space becomes locally flat and the static patch tends to Rindler space. A holographic description of the static patch must result in a holographic description of some flat space theory, expressed in Rindler coordinates. Given such a holographic theory how does one decode the hologram and determine the bulk flat space theory, its particle spectrum, forces, and bulk quantum fields? In this paper we will answer this question for a particular case: DSSYK at infinite temperature and show that the bulk theory is a strongly coupled version of the 't Hooft model, i.e., (1+1)-dimensional QCD, with a single quark flavor. It may also be thought of as an open string theory with mesons lying on a single Regge trajectory.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of 4d Weyl fermion with discrete symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit anomaly index formulas for 4d Weyl fermions charged under discrete symmetries $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}$ by systematically reducing the known continuous anomaly indices for $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathrm{U}(1) \equiv \mathrm{Spin}^c$ symmetries. Our approach leverages the natural group homomorphisms $$ \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathrm{U}(1)) \longrightarrow \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n), \quad \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin}^c) \longrightarrow \mathrm{TP}_5(\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}), $$ which map continuous topological phases to their discrete counterparts. We compute the images of these homomorphisms explicitly by evaluating $\eta$-invariants on key manifold generators: the 5d lens space bundle $X(n;1,1)$ and $L(n;1) \times \mathrm{K3}$ (with $\mathrm{K3}$ the K3 surface) for $\mathrm{Spin} \times \mathbb{Z}_n$, and the 5d lens space $L(m;1,1,1)$ and $L(m;1) \times \mathrm{E}$ (with $\mathrm{E}$ the Enriques surface) for $\mathrm{Spin} \times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}} \mathbb{Z}_{2m}$. These results provide a unifying framework to compute and classify nonperturbative global anomalies of discrete symmetries -- in fermionic theories with discrete gauge or global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider compactifications of higher-dimensional supergravities on Riemann-flat manifolds of dimension d ($3 \le d \le 7$) that fully break supersymmetry at the classical level on a resulting D-dimensional Minkowski space. We systematically discuss consistency conditions, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum and harmonics, and the resulting one-loop effective potential $V_1$, focusing for illustration on maximal supergravity and d=3, in particular on the $T^3/Z_3$ and on the Hantzsche-Wendt manifolds. We show how the KK spectrum is organized in multiplets of the broken supersymmetry, derive new universal supertrace mass relations valid at each KK level and obtain an analytic finite expression for $V_1$ after resumming the contributions of all KK levels. In all examples $V_1$ is negative definite and scales with inverse powers of some internal radii. We extensively comment, when applicable, on the relation with the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and with supersymmetry-breaking string compactifications on freely acting symmetric orbifolds. We also finally clarify the assumptions and constraints for Scherk-Schwarz reductions to correspond to twisted tori compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and the bosonic ghost-scale symmetries of a set of coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) combined field-theoretic system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories. We demonstrate that the Noether (anti-)BRST charges are non-nilpotent due to the presence of a set of non-trivial Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions on our theory. These CF-type restrictions are derived and discussed from different theoretical angles in our present endeavor. In addition to it, we obtain the nilpotent versions of the above (anti-)BRST charges from their counterparts non-nilpotent versions and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent charges to show that the physical states (existing in the total quantum Hilbert space of states) are those that are annihilated by the operator forms of the first-class constraints of our classical 4D combined field-theoretic system. The standard BRST algebra among the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and the bosonic ghost charge is derived, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms falling into a black hole (BH) through a cavity are shown to enable coherent amplification of light quanta powered by the BH gravitational vacuum energy. This process can harness the BH energy towards useful purposes, such as propelling a spaceship trapped by the BH. The process can occur via transient amplification of a signal field by falling atoms that are partly excited by Hawking radiation reflected by an orbiting mirror. In the steady-state regime of thermally equilibrated atoms that weakly couple to the field, this amplifier constitutes a BH-powered quantum heat engine. The envisaged effects substantiate the thermodynamic approach to BH acceleration radiation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the effects of a local axion dark matter background on the $g-2$ of the electron. We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of information scrambling in bosonic systems undergoing Gaussian unitary evolution associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Relational Dynamics with Periodic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a systematic way in which a relational dynamics can be established relative to periodic clocks both in the classical and quantum theories, emphasising the parallels between them. We show that: (1) classical and quantum relational observables that encode the value of a quantity relative to a periodic clock are only invariant along the gauge orbits generated by the Hamiltonian constraint if the quantity itself is periodic, and otherwise the observables are only transiently invariant per clock cycle (this implies, in particular, that counting winding numbers does not lead to invariant observables relative to the periodic clock); (2) the quantum relational observables can be obtained from a partial group averaging procedure over a single clock cycle; (3) there is an equivalence ('trinity') between the quantum theories based on the quantum relational observables of the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantisation, the relational Schr\"odinger picture of the Page-Wootters formalism, and the relational Heisenberg picture that follows from quantum deparametrisation, all three taken relative to periodic clocks (implying that the dynamics in all three is necessarily periodic); (4) in the context of periodic clocks, the original Page-Wootters definition of conditional probabilities fails for systems that have a continuous energy spectrum and, using the equivalence between the Page-Wootters and the clock-neutral, gauge-invariant formalism, must be suitably updated. Finally, we show how a system evolving periodically with respect to a periodic clock can evolve monotonically with respect to an aperiodic clock, without inconsistency. The presentation is illustrated by several examples, and we conclude with a brief comparison to other approaches in the literature that also deal with relational descriptions of periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the invariant mass of dijets produced in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation processes up to four loops in perturbation theory for both anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ jet algorithms. The calculations, performed within the eikonal approximation and employing strong-energy ordering, capture the full analytic structure of the leading Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms, including full colour and jet-radius dependence. We evaluate the significance of these logarithms and the convergence of the four loop perturbative expansion by comparing with all-orders numerical results.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topological T-duality from oriented sphere bundles to transgressive fibrations, a more general type fibration characterised by the abundance of transgressive elements. Examples of transgressive fibrations include principal $\mathrm{U}(n)$-bundles therefore our notion of T-duality belongs to the realm of non-Abelian T-duality. We prove that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We then introduce Clifford--Courant algebroids, show that one can assign such an algebroid to a transgressive fibration and that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic Clifford--Courant algebroids. We provide several examples illustrating different properties of T-dual spaces. A few typos corrected in v2.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for sufficiently large $\kappa$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generate gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Static horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although previous results have ruled out the possibility of a static horizon in cosmology, we present black hole and white hole metrics that retain static horizons while reproducing cosmological behavior at large distances. Using an appropriate coordinate choice, we demonstrate that a static horizon can exist in a cosmological setting without introducing curvature invariant singularities at the horizon. The resulting metric reduces to the Schwarzschild de Sitter solution when the Hubble parameter is constant. We find that white hole metrics in an expanding universe (or black holes in a contracting universe) are significantly easier to construct, as a black hole in an expanding cosmology requires the velocity function to change sign. Consequently, this work primarily examines white holes in expanding cosmologies as a foundation for subsequent analysis of black holes in expanding universes. In later sections, we investigate scenarios involving a white hole coupled with cosmological matter, as well as a white hole with both matter and a cosmological constant. Assuming the pressure component takes its cosmological value, we show that the physical radius of the apparent horizon can asymptotically approach a constant value at late times. This metric avoids pathologies such as a singular horizon in the limit of a vanishing Hubble parameter. Finally, we analyze the realistic case of a black hole embedded in pressureless cosmological matter with and without a cosmological constant and explore its properties.</description>

      <title>Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</description>

Abstract: We apply the formalism of coherent states in quantum optics to pomeron evolution and show that evolving squeezed pomeron states are equivalent to pomeron fan diagrams at the leading order of perturbative expansion. Based on our results, we interpret the action of the displacement operator as pomeron propagation and the action of the squeeze operator as pomeron interaction.</description>

      <title>Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes and $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <title>Barrow holographic dark energy interacting model in the presence of radiation and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of dynamical radiation in the interacting barrow holographic dark energy model for a non-flat universe. For both open and closed universes, we have obtained the evolution equation for the energy density parameters for dark energy, dark matter and radiation for four different kinds of interaction among the seven possible linear phenomenological interactions. We have then numerically solved those coupled differential equations to show their behaviour with the redshift parameter. Also, the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state parameter with redshift for different interaction models are shown. For all four interaction models, it is also found that for higher values of the Barrow exponent, the dark energy equation of state parameter shows a transition into the phantom region from the quintessence region in the early time, that is, for lower redshift values. We have also found different epochs corresponding to dark energy-dark matter, dark energy-radiation and dark matter-radiation crossings. These crossing points are also consistent with the thermal history of the universe. We have also obtained various observational constraints for different cosmological parameters for our interacting Barrow holographic dark matter model using the Cosmic chronometer, Baryon Acoustic Oscillator and Pantheon+ data sets. The constraint values of the Hubble parameter in our cosmological shows higher values compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, therefore indicating towards a possible resolution to the Hubble tension problem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$, namely (functional) proportionality between the Cotton-York tensor field and the holographic stress tensor field at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars. The results are compatible with any matter content of the physical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Universal exponents of black hole phase transition at zero-temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of black hole phase transitions at the zero-temperature limit. Our results reveal that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$ represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions near zero temperature and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Scale-anomaly-induced confining pressure within hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>
