      <title>Attention-Based Foundation Model for Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an attention-based foundation model architecture for learning and predicting quantum states across Hamiltonian parameters, system sizes, and physical systems. Using only basis configurations and physical parameters as inputs, our trained neural network is able to produce highly accurate ground state wavefunctions. For example, we build the phase diagram for the 2D square-lattice $t-V$ model with $N$ particles, from only 18 parameters $(V/t,N)$. Thus, our architecture provides a basis for building a universal foundation model for quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n&gt;2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(\pi/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.</description>

      <title>Fermi Liquid Fixed Point Deformations due to Codimension Two Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that codimension-two defects in Fermi liquids deform the renormalization group flow via a marginally relevant coupling. The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Renormalized Spin-Wave Theory of Magnetic and Topological Transitions in Two-Dimensional Honeycomb Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature magnetic and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets using an extended self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory (SRSWT) that incorporates higher-order corrections from the Holstein--Primakoff expansion. Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Experimental benchmark of the quantum-classical crossover in a spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatics in the Dual Space, or There and Back Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the "dual" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities. This procedure transforms a non-perturbative expansion in the original variables into a perturbative expansion in terms of dual fermionic and bosonic fields, exact in both the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In this thesis, we collect and systematize the major developments of dual techniques achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Substrate tuning of the structural and electronic transition in thin flakes of the excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ continues to draw interest for its 326 K phase transition, whose dual electronic and structural nature reflects a complex interplay of electron-hole (excitonic) and electron-lattice interactions. Most studies that have attempted to decipher the relative importance of these interactions, particularly through charge transfer, have been limited to bulk samples. We utilized a thin-flake approach to modify the excitonic interactions in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ via an underlying film of Au. Using polarized Raman spectroscopy, we found that four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on conducting Au show a transition temperature that is both reduced by over 100 K and broadened due to an interfacial charge gradient effect, manifesting the presence of excitonic interactions. In contrast, four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on insulating Al$_2$O$_3$ show nearly bulk-like properties. We also report the development of an all-dry exfoliation and transfer protocol that generalizes substrate engineering for strongly correlated van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Basis Adaptive Algorithm for Quantum Many-Body Systems on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new basis adaptive algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical platforms is introduced to efficiently find the ground-state (gs) properties of quantum many-body systems. The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Hund's coupling driven nature of magnetism in negative charge transfer material, $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microscopic origin of magnetism in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$ by incorporating electronic correlations within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) framework. We note a remarkable agreement of the calculated magnetic observables ( saturation magnetization $\sim$2.4 $\mu_B$; magnetic transition temperature, $T_c$$\sim$350 K) with the experimental results. The system exhibits Hund's coupling-induced strong quasiparticle mass enhancements of upto $m^*/m$ $\sim$7 for Co 3$d$ states, with the largest renormalization occurring in the majority spin $t_{2g}$ orbitals, marking the onset of orbital-selectivity. Our results reveal a Stoner-$like$ collapse of exchange splitting that drives the loss of long-range ferromagnetic order at $T_c$. The breakdown of Fermi-liquid behavior down to $T$$\sim$100 K suggests a suppressed coherence scale. Local magnetic moment originates from a mixed-spin configuration formed through dynamical fluctuation between intermediate-spin and high-spin states. Large charge fluctuations ($\langle$$\Delta$N$^2$$\rangle$$\sim$0.6) together with heavy quasiparticles establish the correlation effects regime, governed predominantly by Hund's physics in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphite exhibits multi-stage phase transitions in the quantum-limit states realized by magnetic fields applied along the c-axis. Despite extensive studies on this phenomenon, the origin remains a matter of debate to this day. We performed high-field magnetotransport measurements on single crystals of graphite, focusing on the non-linear conductivity in pulsed-magnetic fields of up to 75 T. The longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibits distinct non-linearity not only in the first but also in the second field-induced phases.</description>

      <title>The interplay of magnetic order with the electronic scattering and crystal-field effects in a metallic ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic order, charge dynamics, and crystal field excitations underpins the emergent ground states of rare-earth intermetallics. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Neural Network Extrapolation of Quantum Spin Dynamics Across Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical response of quantum materials is central to revealing their microscopic properties, yet access to long-time and large-scale dynamics remains severely limited by rapidly growing computational costs and entanglement, particularly in gapless systems. Here we introduce an autoregressive machine-learning framework that enables the extrapolation of dynamical spin correlations in both time and space beyond the reach of conventional numerical methods. Trained on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations of the gapless XXZ model, our approach is benchmarked against exact solutions available for this analytically solvable system. Combined with physics-informed spatial extension, multi-layer perceptron model using ReLU activation functions has been shown to be superior than convolutional neural networks and linear regressions for longer time extrapolation. Perturbation study of error accumulation further demonstrates that our autoregressive neural network extrapolations are highly robust to perturbations, suggesting stable and reliable predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of gapless quantum many-body systems, in which machine learning extends and complements the capabilities of state-of-the-art numerical approaches.</description>

      <title>Giant hysteretic magnetoresistance accompanying the Mott transition and spin-glass state in organic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant magnetoresistance with a huge hysteresis is observed in the organic metal k-(BEDTTTF)2Hg(SCN)2Br at low temperature in a pressure interval around 3 kbar of a width ~1 kbar. The hysteretic magnetoresistance is isotropic with respect to the direction of magnetic field, which excludes the orbital effect of magnetic field as its origin. The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Low-dimensional magnetic systems based on honeycomb lattices provide a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena that emerge from the intricate interplay of competing spin, orbital, lattice, and dipolar degrees of freedom. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the layered honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet BiCrTeO$_6$ using magnetization, specific heat, muon spin--relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectroscopy, dielectric, pyrocurrent, and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements. Our results reveal an array of intriguing and strongly correlated phenomena, including two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\approx16$ K and $T_{\rm N2}\approx11$ K, a pronounced magnetodielectric coupling effect, and ferroelectric order at $T_{\rm N2}$. Consequently, this compound emerges as a new spin-driven multiferroic system. The SXRD analysis reveals a magnetoelastic-coupling-induced structural phase transition at $T_{\rm N2}$, characterized by a symmetry lowering from P$\bar{3}$1c (163) to P31c (159), which likely triggers the onset of ferroelectricity. In addition to its low-temperature multiferroic behavior, the system exhibits dielectric relaxor characteristics at higher temperatures within the paramagnetic region ($T&lt;50$ K), which is intrinsically linked to the antisite disorder of Cr and Te atoms.</description>

      <title>Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm \pi/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-\gamma}$ with $2&lt;\gamma &lt; 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $\gamma\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $\gamma$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</description>

      <title>The classical-quantum disproportionation transition and magnetic ordering in RNiO$_3$ nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pm\delta)-}$ ($0 \le \delta \le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm \delta)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and novel quantum criticality in the strongly interacting quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($\nu \approx 0.94$, $\beta \approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>CrFe2Ge2: Investigation of novel ferromagnetic material of Fe13Ge8-type crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized a novel intermetallic compound $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ with the $\rm Fe_{13}Ge_{8}$-type crystal structure. A structural study is presented combining single-crystal X-ray diffraction and M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of two distinct Fe sublattices. $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ exhibits a metallic ferromagnetic state with $T_C \approx \rm 200~K$. This material does not follow the usual $M^2 \propto H/M$ Arrott law, rather a modified Arrott law is obeyed in this material. The critical exponents determined from detailed analysis of modified Arrott plots were found to be $\beta = 0.392$, $\gamma = 1.309$ and $\delta = 4.26$ obtained from the critical isotherm at $ T_{\rm C} =\rm 200~K$. Self-consistency and reliability of the critical exponent analysis were verified by the Widom scaling law and scaling equations. Using the results from renormalization group calculation, the critical behavior of $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ is akin to that of a $d=3, n=3$ ferromagnet in which the magnetic exhange distance is found to decay as $J(r) \approx r^{-4.86}$ with long-range magnetic coupling. The evaluated Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio of $\sim 3$ points to an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. Low-temperature measurements of resistivity, $p(T)$, and specific heat, $C_P(T)$, reveal a pronounced contribution from electron-magnon scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic classification of (2+1)d Gross--Neveu--Yukawa-like models built out of one or more 4-component Dirac fermions and $M$ scalar fields, which preserve an O($M$) symmetry rotating the scalars. We then identify the perturbative fixed points of these models in the $4-\epsilon$ expansion. Our classification highlights several targets for the conformal bootstrap and reveals a new fixed point with $M=3$, which we call the "orthogonal Heisenberg" CFT.</description>

      <title>Holographic Representation of One-Dimensional Many-Body Quantum States via Isometric Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ans\"atze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.</description>

      <title>Uniform matrix product states with a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</description>

      <title>Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.</description>

Abstract: A nonrelativistic proof of the spin-statistics theorem is given in terms of the field operators satisfying commutation and anticommutation relations, which are introduced here in the coordinate space as a means to build the permutation symmetry into the brackets of identical particles. An eigenvalue problem of a $\pi$-rotation for a product of two annihilation operators is combined with an analysis on its rotational property to prove the connection that the field operators for integral-spin and half-integral-spin particles obey the commutation and anticommutation relations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Anion correlation induced nonrelativistic spin splitting in rutile antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many studies of non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS), or altermagnetism, have focused on idealized, perfectly ordered crystals, relying on symmetry-based approaches to identify candidate materials. Here, we theoretically investigate how local short-range ordering (SRO) influences NRSS of energy bands in partially ordered collinear antiferromagnetic iron oxyfluoride (FeOF). Using the cluster expansion method, we identify four nearly degenerate structures (energy difference $\leq 8$ meV per formula unit) that represent distinct snapshots of local plane-to-plane O/F correlations. Our density functional theory (DFT) results show robust NRSS along the $\Gamma$-M direction in all four structures, despite the absence of long-range order. The magnitude and character of the splitting depend sensitively on the specific direction of anion correlations, effects that are not fully captured in high-symmetry average structures. Notably, two configurations ($Pmc2_1$ and $Pm$) exhibit $\Gamma$-point spin splitting absent in ordered FeF$_2$ and a virtual crystal approximation model of FeOF. We further predict distinct magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signatures, enabling experimental detection of SRO-driven electronic structure changes. These results highlight heteroanionic compounds as a promising design space for NRSS antiferromagnets, with experimentally synthesized FeOF already exhibiting a substantially higher N\'eel temperature (315\,K) than FeF$_2$ (79\,K).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument.
  In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems.
  An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Stripe/nematic Phase of Composite Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time-enhanced feedback-based quantum algorithms for universal ground-state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical dynamics and emergent universality in decoherent digital quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Probing Pair Density Waves with Twisted Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period -- an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. For both models, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous continuous-symmetry breaking and tower of states in a comb chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the study of a one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a comb lattice, this work identifies an example of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking in a 1D system with short-range interactions. When a symmetry-preserving relevant perturbation is applied to the system, we find that this model can always be described by the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem. The Shen-Qiu-Tian theorem establishes a direct connection between the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem (in the case of bipartite lattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices) and the breaking of continuous symmetry. Moreover, although previous studies have suggested that the presence of a tower of states (TOS) serves as an important numerical diagnostic of a system's tendency toward spontaneous symmetry breaking, these investigations have primarily focused on 2D systems. In 1D systems, however, the presence of long-range order does not automatically imply the emergence of a TOS. Here, we observe the existence of a TOS in a 1D realistic ferrimagnetic lattice system with short-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</description>

Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>

      <title>Tunneling spectroscopy of the spinon-Kondo effect in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10886v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronounced temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel (TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T &lt; TED to ~ 3 ps at T &gt; TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few parameters, which are known only at leading order in perturbative expansions. The major challenges come from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and that it is closely related to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of conserved current 3-point correlators using exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep only the first few terms in the subgraph expansions to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative results with the bootstrap data and discuss their application to conductivity near the quantum critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral approach. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.</description>
