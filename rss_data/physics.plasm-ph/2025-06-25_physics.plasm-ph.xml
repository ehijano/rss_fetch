      <title>Electromagnetic and Centrifugal Effects on Plasma Acceleration in the Magnetic Nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma flow and acceleration in the converging-diverging magnetic field configuration, such as magnetic nozzle in electric propulsion and open magnetic mirrors for fusion applications are considered. This work analyses plasma acceleration in the magnetic nozzle with an emphasis on the electromagnetic effects and centrifugal forces due to plasma rotation. Intrinsic coupling of the azimuthal rotation and azimuthal magnetic field is analyzed, and additional plasma acceleration due to the conversion of the energy of the azimuthal magnetic field and azimuthal rotation is demonstrated. For large expansion in the diverging magnetic field plasma flow velocities may approach and exceed the Alfven velocity. In these regimes, stationary solutions for the transonic and trans-Alfvenic flows have been obtained that demonstrate the existence of the unique regular solution passing through all critical points within the MHD theory, i. e. the points where the plasma flow is equal to the signal velocities of the MHD modes: slow and fast magnetohydrodynamic waves and Alfven wave. The time-dependent initial value simulations show that stationary equilibrium flows are robust and stable, so that time-dependent solutions converge toward stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Laser Wakefield Acceleration Driven by a Discrete Flying Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) may enable the next generation of TeV-scale lepton colliders. Reaching such energies will likely require multiple LWFA stages to overcome limitations on the energy gain achievable in a single stage. The use of stages, however, introduces challenges such as alignment, adiabatic matching between stages, and a lower average accelerating gradient. Here, we propose a discrete flying focus that can deliver higher energy gain in a single stage, thereby reducing the number of stages required for a target energy. A sequence of laser pulses with staggered focal points and delays drives a plasma wave in which an electron beam experiences a near-constant accelerating gradient over distances beyond those attainable with a conventional pulse. Simulations demonstrate that a discrete flying focus with a total energy of 150 J can transfer 40 GeV per electron to a 50-pC beam in a single 30-cm stage, corresponding to 50 dephasing lengths.</description>

      <title>The effect of the electron's spin magnetic moment on quantum radiation in strong electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-intense laser pulses can create sufficiently strong fields to probe quantum electrodynamics effects in a novel regime. By colliding a 60 GeV electron bunch with a laser pulse focussed to the maximum achievable intensity of $10^{23}$ Wcm$^{-2}$, we can reach fields much stronger than the critical Schwinger field in the electron rest frame. When the ratio of these fields $\chi_e\gg1$ we find that the hard ($&gt;25$ \thinspace GeV) radiation from the electron has a substantial contribution from spin-light. 33% more photons are produced above this energy due to spin-light, the radiation resulting from the acceleration of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment. This increase in high-energy photons results in 14% more positrons produced with energy above $25$ GeV. Furthermore, the enhanced photon production due to spin-light results in a 46% increase in the electron recoil radiation reaction. These observable signatures provide a potential route to observing spin-light in the strongly quantum regime ($\chi_e\gg1$) for the first time.</description>

      <title>Spatial, Spectral and Temporal Response of High Intensity Laser Plasma Mirrors- Direct Observation of the Ponderomotive Push</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma-based optics have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating and amplifying ultra-intense laser pulses. However, the inherently nonlinear and dynamic nature of plasma leads to significant spatial, spectral, and temporal modulations when driven at relativistic intensities. These modifications can dramatically alter the structure of the reflected laser pulses, posing challenges for their use in applications such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and X-ray generation, as well as relativistic particle acceleration. Comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostics are essential to accurately characterize these so-called `plasma mirrors' (PMs). We present a direct, \textit{in situ} measurement of the three-dimensional plasma surface evolution during femtosecond laser irradiation, achieved through simultaneous analysis of the wavefront, spectrum, and temporal profile of the reflected light. Our measurements reveal surface deformations on the order of a few hundred nanometers at relativistic intensities, in agreement with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) simulations. Additionally, the PM induces substantial modifications to the pulse spectrum and temporal profile, introducing spatio-temporal couplings.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of muon production from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental evidence for the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $95\pm3$\% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of muon generation using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for collisional-radiative argon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas -- crucial to applications in electric propulsion, hypersonic re-entry, and astrophysical flows -- requires state-specific collisional-radiative (CR) kinetic models, but these come at a prohibitive computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been mitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing equations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features of the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model (ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance the covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's output sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the dominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output behavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear forward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver and applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems. The ROM achieves a 3$\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one order of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining errors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly reproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations, electron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in contrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under these challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key physical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast, reliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.</description>
