      <title>Global Universality of Singular Values in Products of Many Large Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular values (and Lyapunov exponents) for products of $N$ independent $n\times n$ random matrices with i.i.d. entries. Such matrix products have been extensively analyzed using free probability, which applies when $n\to \infty$ at fixed $N$, and the multiplicative ergodic theorem, which holds when $N\to \infty$ while $n$ remains fixed. The regime when $N,n\to \infty$ simultaneously is considerably less well understood, and our work is the first to prove universality for the global distribution of singular values in this setting. Our main result gives non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff distance between the empirical measure of (normalized) squared singular values and the uniform measure on $[0, 1]$ that go to zero when $n, N\to \infty$ at any relative rate. We assume only that the distribution of matrix entries has zero mean, unit variance, bounded fourth moment, and a bounded density. Our proofs rely on two key ingredients. The first is a novel small-ball estimate on singular vectors of random matrices from which we deduce a non-asymptotic variant of the multiplicative ergodic theorem that holds for growing matrix size $n$. The second is a martingale concentration argument, which shows that while Lyapunov exponents at large $N$ are not universal at fixed matrix size, their empirical distribution becomes universal as soon as the matrix size grows with $N$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Approximation for Slow-Fast SDEs with State-Dependent Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the diffusion approximation for slow-fast stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching, where the slow component $X^{\varepsilon}$ is the solution of a stochastic differential equation with additional homogenization term, while the fast component $\alpha^{\varepsilon}$ is a switching process. We first prove the weak convergence of $\{X^\varepsilon\}_{0&lt;\varepsilon\leq 1}$ to $\bar{X}$ in the space of continuous functions, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$. Using the martingale problem approach and Poisson equation associated with a Markov chain, we identify this weak limiting process as the unique solution $\bar{X}$ of a new stochastic differential equation, which has new drift and diffusion terms that differ from those in the original equation. Next, we prove the order $1/2$ of weak convergence of $X^{\varepsilon}_t$ to $\bar{X}_t$ by applying suitable test functions $\phi$, for any $t\in [0, T]$. Additionally, we provide an example to illustrate that the order we achieve is optimal.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Symmetric Random Matrices: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be an n*n symmetric random matrix with independent, non-constant subgaussian entries (not necessarily identically distributed). In this paper, we introduce a distance theorem. Building on this theorem, we analyze the eigenvalues of A to derive probability inequalities for the eigenvalue gaps of A. Moreover, we determine the probability for the smallest singular value of a submatrix of A. This enables us to obtain the probability of delocalization of the eigenvectors of A.</description>

      <title>Sisyphus random walks in the presence of moving traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that, in the presence of a static absorbing trap, Sisyphus random walkers with a restart mechanism are characterized by {\it exponentially} decreasing asymptotic survival probability functions. Interestingly, in the present compact paper we prove analytically that, in the presence of a moving trap whose velocity approaches zero asymptotically in time as $v_{\text{trap}}\sim 1/t$, the survival probabilities of the Sisyphus walkers are dramatically changed into inverse {\it power-law} decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Mixing time of a matrix random walk generated by elementary transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markov chain on invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ which moves by picking an ordered pair of distinct rows and add the first one to the other, modulo $2$. We establish a logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constant $n^2$, which yields an upper bound of $O(n^2\log n)$ on the mixing time. We also study another chain which picks a row at random and randomize it conditionally on the resulting matrix being invertible, and show that the mixing time is between $n\log n$ and $4n\log n$.</description>

      <title>The oriented swap process on half line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the oriented swap process on the positive integers and its asymptotic properties. Our results extend a theorem by Angel, Holroyd, and Romik regarding the trajectories of particles in the finite oriented swap process. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the type of a particle at the leftmost position over time. Our approach relies on a relationship between multi-species particle systems and Hecke algebras, complemented by a detailed asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of phase transition of three-dimensional square-lattice XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuity of magnetization at the phase transition of the ferromagnetic XY model in the three-dimensional square lattice with the nearest neighborhood interaction. We assume that, at the critical temperature, with probability 1, for every edge in the infinite directed graph generated by the random path representation, finitely many edges exist so that they form a finite loop. Then, we prove that the phase transition is continuous at the critical temperature. The main technical contribution is to find a switching lemma to establish a bijection between equally weighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Preferential Attachment Trees with Vertex Death: Lack of Persistence of the Maximum Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential Attachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an alive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\geq1$ either a new vertex with label $n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected preferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected preferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. We introduce a generalised concept of persistence for evolving random graph models. Let $O_n$ be the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest alive vertex), and let $I_n$ be the label of the alive vertex with the largest degree (among all alive vertices). Persistence occurs when $I_n/O_n$ is tight; lack of persistence occurs when $I_n/O_n$ diverges with $n$. We study lack of persistence and identify two regimes: the old are rich and the rich die young regime. In the rich are old regime, though the oldest alive vertices in the tree typically have the largest degrees, lack of persistence can occur subject to the condition $\sum_{i=0}^\infty 1/(b(i)+d(i))^2=\infty$, under which lucky vertices that are younger than the oldest vertices can attain the largest degrees by step $n$, generalising results by Banerjee and Bhamidi. In contrast, lack of persistence always occurs in the rich die young regime. This regime is novel and cannot be observed in models without death. Here, vertices can survive exceptionally long by obtaining a low degree, whereas vertices with a large degree die much faster, causing lack of persistence. A main technique is an embedding of the discrete tree process into a Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process and a higher-order analysis of the resulting birth-death mechanism based on moderate deviation principles with exponential tilting.</description>

      <title>The Hellinger-Kantorovich metric measure geometry on spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with Riemannian distance $\mathsf{d}_g$, and $\mathcal{M}(M)$ be the space of all non-negative Borel measures on $M$, endowed with the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance $\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g}$ induced by $\mathsf{d}_g$.
  Firstly, we prove that $\left(\mathcal{M}(M),\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g}\right)$ is a universally infinitesimally Hilbertian metric space, and that a natural class of cylinder functions is dense in energy in the Sobolev space of every finite Borel measure on $\mathcal{M}(M)$.
  Secondly, we endow $\mathcal{M}(M)$ with its canonical reference measure, namely A.M. Vershik's multiplicative infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure $\mathcal{L}_\theta$, $\theta&gt;0$, and we consider: (a) the geometric structure on $\mathcal{M}(M)$ induced by the natural action on $\mathcal{M}(M)$ of the semi-direct product of diffeomorphisms and densities on $M$, under which $\mathcal{L}_\theta$ is the unique invariant measure; and (b) the metric measure structure of $\left(\mathcal{M}(M),\mathsf{H\! K}_{\mathsf{d}_g},\mathcal{L}_{\theta}\right)$, inherited from that of $(M,\mathsf{d}_g,\mathrm{vol}_g)$. We identify the canonical Dirichlet form $\left(\mathcal{E},\mathscr{D}(\mathcal{E})\right)$ of (a) with the Cheeger energy of (b), thus proving that these two structures coincide. We further prove that $\left(\mathcal{E},\mathscr{D}(\mathcal{E})\right)$ is a conservative quasi-regular strongly local Dirichlet form on $\mathcal{M}(M)$, recurrent if and only if $\theta\in (0,1]$, and properly associated with the Brownian motion of the Hellinger-Kantorovich geometry on $\mathcal{M}(M)$.</description>

      <title>A non-homogeneous Markov early epidemic growth dynamics model. Application to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new markovian stochastic model that can be described as a non-homogeneous Pure Birth process. We propose a functional form of birth rate that depends on the number of individuals in the population and on the elapsed time, allowing us to model a contagion effect. Thus, we model the early stages of an epidemic. The number of individuals then becomes the infectious cases and the birth rate becomes the incidence rate. We obtain this way a process that depends on two competitive phenomena, infection and immunization. Variations in those rates allow us to monitor how effective the actions taken by government and health organizations are. From our model, three useful indicators for the epidemic evolution over time are obtained: the immunization rate, the infection/immunization ratio and the mean time between infections (MTBI). The proposed model allows either positive or negative concavities for the mean value curve, provided the infection/immunization ratio is either greater or less than one. We apply this model to the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still in its early growth stage in Latin American countries. As it is shown, the model accomplishes a good fit for the real number of both positive cases and deaths. We analyze the evolution of the three indicators for several countries and perform a comparative study between them. Important conclusions are obtained from this analysis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of solitons (or "soliton gas'') by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these solitons; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the soliton data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the soliton locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <title>A simple model of quantum walk with a gap in distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of random walks and their probability distributions are different from each other. A quantum walker distributes on a Hilbert space and it is observed at a location with a probability. The finding probabilities have been investigated and some interesting things have been analytically discovered. They are, for instance, ballistic behavior, localization, or a gap. We study a 1-dimensional quantum walk in this paper. Although the walker launches off a location under a localized initial state, some numerical experiments show that the quantum walker does not seem to distribute around the launching location, which suggests that the probability distribution holds a gap around the launching location. To prove the gap analytically, we derive a long-time limit distribution, from which one can tell more details about the finding probability.</description>

      <title>Maximal entropy random walks and central Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the concept of Maximal Entropy Random Walks (MERWs) on Weighted Bratteli Diagrams (WBDs), maximizing entropy production along paths as a natural criterion for choosing random walks on networks. Initially defined for irreducible finite graphs, MERWs were recently extended to the infinite setting in [1]. Bratteli Diagrams model various growth processes, such as the Young Lattice, where the Plancherel growth process emerges as a MERW. We show that MERWs are special cases of central Markov chains, which, in general, provide a powerful framework for deriving combinatorial identities. Regarding growing trees, in particular, we retrieve and extend Han's hook-length formula for binary trees and demonstrate that the Binary Search Tree (BST) process is a MERW, recovering its asymptotic behavior. We also introduce preferential attachment to generalize BSTs. For comb models, significant central measures appear, including the Chinese restaurant process, providing an alternative proof of the Poisson-Dirichlet limit distribution. Finally, we propose a Monte Carlo method, based on Knuth's algorithm, to approximate MERWs. We apply it to a pyramidal growth model, drawing connections with the limit shape of Young diagrams under the Plancherel measure.</description>

      <title>Sampling the space of solutions of an artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. While these spikes aid gradient descent, they can trap general sampling algorithms at low temperatures; they remain connected by complex paths in a confined, non-flat region. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures. Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.</description>

      <title>Limits of Random Motzkin paths with KPZ related asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Motzkin paths of length $L$ with general weights on the edges and end points. We investigate the limit behavior of the initial and final segments of the random Motzkin path viewed as a pair of processes starting from each of the two end points as $L$ becomes large. We then study macroscopic limits of the resulting processes, where in two different regimes we obtain Markov processes that appeared in the description of the stationary measure for the KPZ equation on the half line and of conjectural stationary measure of the hypothetical KPZ fixed point on the half line. Our results rely on the behavior of the Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials in the neighbourhood of the upper end of their orthogonality interval and on the limiting properties of the $q$-Pochhammer and $q$-Gamma functions as $q\nearrow 1$.</description>

      <title>Villain action in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Villain interaction applied to lattice gauge theory can be obtained as the limit of both Wilson and Manton interactions on a larger graph which we call the {\em carpet graph.} This is the lattice gauge theory analog of a well-known property for spin $O(N)$ models where Villain type interactions are the limit of $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ spin systems defined on a {\em cable graph}.
  Perhaps surprisingly in the setting of lattice gauge theory, our proof also applies to non-Abelian lattice theory such as $SU(3)$-lattice gauge theory and its limiting Villain interaction.
  In the particular case of an Abelian lattice gauge theory, this allows us to extend the validity of Ginibre inequality to the case of the Villain interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in which each spin can take one of $\kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as colors. It was suggested in arXiv:2310.06745 that the order parameter for this model is always invariant with respect to permutations of the colors. We show here that this is false whenever $\kappa \ge 58$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimension for all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>

      <title>Tail Asymptotics of Cluster Sizes in Multivariate Heavy-Tailed Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a distributional fixed-point equation related to a multi-type branching process that is key in the cluster sizes analysis of multivariate heavy-tailed Hawkes processes. Specifically, we explore the tail behavior of its solution and demonstrate the emergence of a form of multivariate hidden regular variation. Large values of the cluster size vector result from one or several significant jumps. A discrete optimization problem involving any given rare event set of interest determines the exact configuration of these large jumps and the degree of hidden regular variation. Our proofs rely on a detailed probabilistic analysis of the spatiotemporal structure of multiple large jumps in multi-type branching processes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing and Matching for Two-Sided Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications from gig economy and online marketplaces, we study a two-sided queueing system under joint pricing and matching controls. The queueing system is modeled by a bipartite graph, where the vertices represent customer or server types and the edges represent compatible customer-server pairs. Both customers and servers sequentially arrive to the system and join separate queues according to their types. The arrival rates of different types depend on the prices set by the system operator and the expected waiting time. At any point in time, the system operator can choose certain customers to match with compatible servers. The objective is to maximize the long-run average profit for the system. We first propose a fluid approximation based pricing and max-weight matching policy, which achieves an $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ optimality rate when all the arrival rates are scaled by $\eta$. We further show that a two-price and max-weight matching policy achieves an improved $O(\eta^{1/3})$ optimality rate. Under a broad class of pricing policies, we prove that any matching policy has an optimality rate that is lower bounded by $\Omega(\eta^{1/3})$. Thus, the latter policy achieves the optimal rate with respect to $\eta$. We also demonstrate the advantage of max-weight matching with respect to the number of server and customer types $n$. Under a complete resource pooling condition, we show that max-weight matching achieves $O(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n^{1/3})$ optimality rates for static and two-price policies, respectively, and the latter matches the lower bound $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. In comparison, the randomized matching policy may have an $\Omega(n)$ optimality rate.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver for Learning PDEs via Probabilistic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05104v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited available data, training the function-to-function neural PDE solver in an unsupervised manner is essential. However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines. The source code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/optray/MCNP.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online SGD in High-dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has emerged as the quintessential method in a data scientist's toolbox. Using SGD for high-stakes applications requires, however, careful quantification of the associated uncertainty. Towards that end, in this work, we establish a high-dimensional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for linear functionals of online SGD iterates for overparametrized least-squares regression with non-isotropic Gaussian inputs. We first show that a bias-corrected CLT holds when the number of iterations of the online SGD, $t$, grows sub-linearly in the dimensionality, $d$. In order to use the developed result in practice, we further develop an online approach for estimating the variance term appearing in the CLT, and establish high-probability bounds for the developed online estimator. Together with the CLT result, this provides a fully online and data-driven way to numerically construct confidence intervals. This enables practical high-dimensional algorithmic inference with SGD and to the best of our knowledge, is the first such result.</description>

      <title>Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data follows a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updates this coefficient over time, forming a dynamic strategy that approaches the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies can be universally guaranteed under stationary stochastic markets. Furthermore, in certain time-reversible stochastic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on past market information during investment, does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-width asymptotics of random fully connected neural networks with weights drawn from $\alpha$-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed distributions arising as the limiting distributions in the Gnedenko-Kolmogorov heavy-tailed central limit theorem. We show that in an arbitrary bounded Euclidean domain $\mathcal{U}$ with smooth boundary, the random field at the infinite-width limit, characterized in previous literature in terms of finite-dimensional distributions, has sample functions in the fractional Sobolev-Slobodeckij-type quasi-Banach function space $W^{s,p}(\mathcal{U})$ for integrability indices $p &lt; \alpha$ and suitable smoothness indices $s$ depending on the activation function of the neural network, and establish the functional convergence of the processes in the space of probability measures on $W^{s,p}(\mathcal{U})$. This convergence result is leveraged in the study of functional posteriors for edge-preserving Bayesian inverse problems with stable neural network priors.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors with Symmetric Minibatch Splitting Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>
