      <title>Integrating Evolutionary Biology into Physics Classroom: Scaling, Dimension, Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Galileo and (more recently) D'Arcy Thompson, it has been understood that physical processes and constraints influence biological structures and their resulting functions. However these cross-discpline connections -- and their importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are rarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of physics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an important geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon clicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary concepts. By connecting abstract physical laws with biological (and technological) applications, our approach aims to help students appreciate the deep connections between physical and biological sciences, thereby enriching the learning experience in introductory physics courses.</description>

      <title>Transcription factor clusters as information transfer agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deciphering how genes interpret information from the concentration of transcription factors (TFs) within the cell nucleus remains a fundamental question in gene regulation. Recent advancements have unveiled the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules in the nucleus, posing challenges to the precise decoding of concentration signals. To explore this phenomenon, we employ high-resolution single-cell imaging of a fluorescently tagged TF protein, Bicoid, in living fly embryos. We show that accumulation of Bicoid in submicron clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient, and that cluster intensity, size, and frequency offer remarkably precise spatial cues. We further discover that various known gene targets of Bicoid activation colocalize with clusters and that for the target gene Hunchback, this colocalization is dependent on its enhancer binding affinity. Modeling information transfer through these clusters suggests that clustering offers a more rapid sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>

      <title>Channel assisted noise propagation in a two-step cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal propagation in biochemical networks is characterized by the inherent randomness in gene expression and fluctuations of the environmental components, commonly known as intrinsic and extrinsic noise, respectively. We present a theoretical framework for noise propagation in a generic two-step cascade (S$\rightarrow$X$\rightarrow$Y) regarding intrinsic and extrinsic noise. We identify different channels of noise transmission that regulate the individual and the overall noise properties of each component. Our analysis shows that the intrinsic noise of S alleviates the general noise and information transmission capacity along the cascade. On the other hand, the intrinsic noise of X and Y acts as a bottleneck of information transmission. We also show a hierarchical relationship among the intrinsic noise levels of S, X, and Y, with S exhibiting the highest level of intrinsic noise, followed by X and then Y. This hierarchy is preserved within the two-step cascade, facilitating the highest information transmission from S to Y via X.</description>

      <title>Population genetics: an introduction for physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population genetics lies at the heart of evolutionary theory. This topic forms part of many biological science curricula but is rarely taught to physics students. Since physicists are becoming increasingly interested in biological evolution, we aim to provide a brief introduction to population genetics, written for physicists. We start with two background chapters: chapter 1 provides a brief historical introduction to the topic, while chapter 2 provides some essential biological background. We begin our main content with chapter 3 which discusses the key concepts behind Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. Chapter 4 covers the basics of how variation is maintained in populations, while chapter 5 discusses mutation and selection. In chapter 6 we discuss stochastic effects in population genetics using the Wright-Fisher model as our example, and finally we offer concluding thoughts and references to excellent textbooks in chapter 7.</description>
