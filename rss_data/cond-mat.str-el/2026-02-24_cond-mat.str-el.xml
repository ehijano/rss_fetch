      <title>Analytic continuation of Green's functions with a neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important problem in many-body physics is to reconstruct the spectral density from the imaginary-time domain Green's function. Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved.</description>

      <title>Is altermagnetism in vanadium oxychalcogenides a lost cause?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium-based oxychalcogenide compounds with the inverse Lieb-lattice (ILL) structural pattern have recently been proposed as candidate altermagnets (AM). However, early studies postulated ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, a critical requirement for preserving the bulk AM state. Here we present a systematic survey of the complete AV2Q2O family (A = K, Rb, Cs; Q = S, Se, Te) in terms of their magnetic ordering and interlayer coupling. While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception. Using hole doping to simulate alkali vacancies, we show that realistic deviations from stoichiometry do not change the magnetic ground state in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Precompression engineering of metal-insulator transition and magnetism in designed breathing kagome systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials featuring dispersive Dirac cones and topological flat bands exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\text{out}}/t_{\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of hard-plane antiferromagnetism in the Kondo lattice Ce2Rh3Ge5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard plane antiferromagnetic order where ordered moments lie perpendicular to the single-ion crystal electric field easy axis is rare in Ce-based Kondo lattices and is a subject of active interest. Here we show that Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ realizes a hard-plane antiferromagnetic state in which partial delocalization of the local moment gives rise to an RKKY exchange that overturns the single-ion easy-axis preference. Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies. In this work, we establish a unified microscopic framework to consistently account for partial $4f$-moment delocalization, enhanced in-plane RKKY exchange, and the resulting hard-plane antiferromagnetic order. Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ thus provides a benchmark system in which single-ion anisotropy, Kondo screening, and RKKY exchange compete on comparable energy scales, revealing a cooperative route to hard-axis ordering in strongly hybridized Kondo lattices.</description>

      <title>Toward the Thermodynamic Limit: Neural Operators for Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mott insulators exhibit complex photoexcitation dynamics under intense optical driving, with potential implications for carrier multiplication beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Electron-electron and electron-phonon collision cross sections in CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) are kagome metals and superconductors, attracting much recent attention as nexus of multiple quantum states. Here, through a systematic study of electric and thermal transport of CsV3Sb5, we identify iy as a metallic Fermi liquid with moderate electronic correlations ans strong electron-phonon (e-ph) collision cross section. We observe contributions to the inelastic electrical resistivity, each dominating within a distinct temperature window. The prefactor of the T2 is consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling for a Fermi liquid with moderate correlation. By performing thermal conductivity measurements at zero and finite magnetic field, we separate the electronic and the lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law is is satisfied in the zero-temperature limit, while a downward deviation emerges at finite temperature due to the mismatch between the prefactors of the electrical and thermal quadratic resistivities, as reported in other metals. The Bloch-Gr\"uneisen description of electron-phonon scattering successfully accounts for both electronic thermal and electrical transport, indicating a remarkably large e-ph collision cross section in CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Chaos to a Reversed Quantum Disentangled Liquid in a Disorder-Free Spin Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms by which isolated interacting quantum systems evade thermalization extend beyond disorder-induced many-body localization, encompassing a growing class of interaction-driven phenomena. We investigate a spin-1/2 ladder with asymmetric XY leg couplings and tunable Ising interactions on the rungs, and identify the microscopic origin of many-body localization (MBL) in this setting. Through a suite of diagnostics -including entanglement dynamics, fidelity susceptibility, adiabatic gauge potential norms, level-spacing statistics and entropy of eigenstates- we uncover a reentrant progression of dynamical regimes as the rung coupling Jz is varied: integrable behavior at Jz=0, quantum chaos at intermediate Jz, and a robust nonthermal regime at strong coupling. In the latter regime, we demonstrate the emergence of a reversed quantum disentangled liquid (reversed-QDL), where the light species thermalizes while the heavy species remains localized. The strong-coupling limit further yields emergent local integrals of motion anchored in a fixed-point structure, providing a microscopic origin of the observed quasi-MBL dynamics. These results establish reversed-QDL as a distinct, disorder-free route to nonergodicity and broaden the classification of dynamical phases in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Bath Fitting for Hamiltonian-Diagonalization Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based initialization method to overcome the nonlinear bath-fitting bottleneck in Hamiltonian-diagonalization-based dynamical mean-field theory (HD-DMFT). In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution.</description>

      <title>Floquet product mode and eigenphase order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness of the Floquet quantum Ising model against integrability-breaking perturbations, focusing on the phase hosting both Majorana zero and $\pi$ modes. A recent work [Phys. Rev. B 110, 075117, (2024)] observed that the Floquet product mode, a composite edge mode constructed from both Majorana operators, is considerably more robust than the individual Majorana edge modes. We analyze these strong modes from the point of view of the eigenphase order present in finite chains with open boundary conditions. As a result of the Majorana modes, all Floquet eigenstates come in quadruplets in the integrable limit. We show that the robustness of the various modes as well as the behavior of the boundary spin correlation functions can be understood in terms of the spectral statistics of these quadruplets in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnons in a layered honeycomb ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical studies have suggested a possible Dirac magnon gap in the two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe$_3$. Detailed neutron scattering measurements were performed to shed light on the existence of the magnon gap, and suggest that the gap is very small or non-existent, with previous measurements being complicated by experimental factors. During these measurements, it was found that the out-of-plane couplings could explain the usual property of the increase in the magnetic transition temperature when CrSiTe$_3$ is exfoliated to monolayers. Furthermore, the material was shown to have anisotropic magnons along the out-of-plane direction, through the proposed Dirac point. We speculate that this is due to an exchange anisotropy, though Kitaev-like interactions alone cannot explain the spectra.</description>

      <title>Non Fermi liquid signatures across strain engineered metal-insulator transition in line-graph lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the properties and thus the functionalities of correlated electron systems via externally tunable perturbations has always remained a cherished goal in quantum condensed matter physics. Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents.</description>

      <title>Coexisting magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a renormalized mean-field study of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model, focusing on the intricate interplay and possible coexistence of magnetic, charge, and superconducting orders. We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with N\'eel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that topologically protected quantum states, such as anyons, may be attached to super/semiconductor heterostructures has received enormous attention, but experimental signatures in 1D systems remain elusive. Here we revisit theoretical underpinnings of anyons in 2D fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, whose signatures have been experimentally observed by independent groups. Invoking novel theorems about the Hopfion or $\mathbb{C}P^1$-model understood as flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy, we demonstrate a robust prediction for possibly nonabelian anyonic states induced by superconducting islands.</description>

      <title>Predicting Magic from Very Few Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonstabilizerness of quantum states is a necessary resource for universal quantum computation, yet its characterization is notoriously demanding. Quantifying nonstabilizerness typically requires an exponential number of measurements and a doubly exponential classical post-processing cost to evaluate its standard monotones. In this work, we show that nonstabilizerness is, to a large extent, in the eyes of the beholder: it can be witnessed and quantified using any set of $m$ $n$-qubit Pauli measurements, provided the set contains anti-commuting pairs. We introduce a general framework that projects the stabilizer polytope onto the subspace defined by these observables and provide an algorithm that estimates magic from Pauli expectation values with runtime exponential in the number of measurements $m$ and polynomial in the number of qubits $n$. By relating the problem to a stabilizer-restricted variant of the quantum marginal problem, we also prove that deciding membership in the corresponding reduced stabilizer polytope is NP-hard. In particular, unless $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{NP}$, no algorithm polynomial in $m$ can solve the problem in full generality, thus establishing fundamental complexity-theoretic limitations. Finally, we employ our framework to compute nonstabilizerness in different Hamiltonian ground states, demonstrating the practical performance of our method in regimes beyond the reach of existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in square-planar nickelates has offered a rich materials platform to explore the origins of cuprate-like superconductivity. Experimental investigations however have largely been limited to the infinite-layer $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth) nickelates. Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Specific features of the magnetic-field dependences of electrical resistivity in Bi--Mn solid solutions with low Mn content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, the field dependences of the magnetoresistance of a textured polycrystalline Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ sample were investigated in the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, and the results were compared with those previously obtained for the solid solution Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ with a lower manganese concentration. It was demonstrated that the magnetoresistance field dependencies for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ differ significantly from those of Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ below 100 K, becoming nearly identical as the temperature approaches room temperature. It was established that the maximum relative magnetoresistance values for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ are observed at a magnetic field of 90 kOe and a temperature of 100 K in both the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, amounting to 3170\% and 380\%, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those previously reported for the solid solution containing less manganese (Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$), which were 3877\% and 742\%, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that differences in field dependence among the studied materials are associated with varying amounts of magnetic $\alpha$-BiMn. The anomalous magnetoresistance behavior, as compared with that of pure bismuth, is attributed to the influence of internal magnetism on electrical transport within the bismuth matrix of the studied solid solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a time-continuous version of a cellular automaton decoder for the toric code in the form of a Lindblad master equation. In this setting, a self-correcting quantum memory becomes a thermodynamical phase of the steady state, which manifests itself through the steady state being topologically ordered. We compute the steady state phase diagram, finding a competition between the error correction rate and the update rate for the classical field of the cellular automaton. Strikingly, we find that self-correction of errors is possible even in situations where conventional quantum error correction does not have a finite threshold.</description>

      <title>Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes on group-valued qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a versatile quantum error-correcting family built out of commuting $X$- and $Z$-type checks. We introduce CSS-like codes on $G$-valued qudits for any finite group $G$ that reduce to qubit CSS codes for $G = \mathbb{Z}_2$ yet generalize the Kitaev quantum double model for general groups. The $X$-checks of our group-CSS codes correspond to left and/or right multiplication by group elements, while $Z$-checks project onto solutions to group word equations. We describe quantum-double models on oriented two-dimensional CW complexes (which need not cellulate a manifold) and prove that, when $G$ is non-Abelian and simple, every $G$-covariant group-CSS code with suitably upper-bounded $Z$-check weight and lower-bounded $Z$-distance reduces to a CW quantum double. We describe the codespace and logical operators of CW quantum doubles via the same intuition used to obtain logical structure of surface codes. We obtain distance bounds for codes on non-Abelian simple groups from the graph underlying the CW complex, and construct intrinsically non-Abelian code families with asymptotically optimal rate and distances. Adding "ghost vertices" to the CW complex generalizes quantum double models with defects and rough boundary conditions whose logical structure can be understood without reference to non-Abelian anyons or defects. Several non-invertible symmetry-protected topological states, both with ordinary and higher-form symmetries, are the unique codewords of simply-connected CW quantum doubles with a single ghost vertex.</description>

      <title>Bridging atomic and mesoscopic length scales with Replica Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Visualizing the intra-unit cell pair density modulation of superconducting FeSe at micron length scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a cornerstone technique for visualizing the electronic density of states with atomic resolution (typically below 0.1 nm). While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic fully-gapped superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ emerges from an exotic, non-metallic normal state that exhibits signatures of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, emergent symmetry and excitonic order. The high upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$ suggests that that the favored pairing state is spin-triplet in nature. Here, we report measurements of the magnetic penetration depth down to $0.08\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.04$) and the specific heat down to $0.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($T/T_c \lesssim 0.2$), and show that they are consistent with a moderately-coupled, fully-gapped superconducting state with marked gap anisotropy and a minimum ($\Delta_{\rm min} \simeq 0.4\,k_{\mathrm{B}}T_c$) occurring over a very narrow region in $k$-space. Combined with knowledge of $H_{c2}$, these measurements support the presence of a nodeless and possibly odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting order parameter in Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$.</description>

      <title>Separation of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism from Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a system is swept through a quantum critical point (QCP), the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the average number of topological defects follows a universal power-law scaling with the ramp time scale. This scaling behavior is determined by the equilibrium critical exponents of the underlying phase transition. We show that the correspondence between Kibble-Zurek scaling and quantum criticality does not hold generally. In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point. Our results, based on models representative of a broad class of quasi-one-dimensional Fermi systems, identify the dynamical conditions under which universal defect scaling emerges and clarify the relation between defect generation and equilibrium criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the entanglement generation between two hexagonal-lattice layers embedded in a microcavity is studied, accounting for both electromagnetic coupling and intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Utilizing a short-time dynamical approach, we perform a perturbative Taylor expansion of the reduced density matrix to characterize the bipartite quantum correlations between the hexagonal layers. We demonstrate that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a localized product state in the conduction bands at t = 0 to a coherent superposition of valence and conduction band states. Our results indicate that the degree of entanglement is highly sensitive to the interlayer photon propagator, which contains the geometric ratios of the layer positions and the height cavity, and the specific Fermi energy and SOI signatures of the respective layers. We show the emergence of spacelike-separated quantum correlations in the ultra-short evolution regime, suggesting that heterostructures in cavities may be suitable to develop experiments for a deep understanding of spacelike-separated quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes as qudit low-density parity-check codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional translation-invariant CSS stabilizer codes over prime-dimensional qudits on the square lattice under twisted boundary conditions, generalizing the Kitaev $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code by augmenting each stabilizer with two additional qudits. Using the Laurent-polynomial formalism, we adapt the Gr\"obner basis to compute the logical dimension $k$ efficiently, without explicitly constructing large parity-check matrices. We then perform a systematic search over various stabilizer realizations and lattice geometries for $p\in\{3,5,7,11\}$, identifying qudit low-density parity-check codes with the optimal finite-size performance. Representative examples include $[[242,10,22]]_3$ and $[[120,6,20]]_{11}$, both achieving $k d^{2}/n=20$. Across the searched regime, the best observed $k d^{2}$ at fixed $n$ increases with $p$, with an empirical relation $k d^{2} = 0.0541 \, n^{2}\ln p + 3.84 \, n$, compatible with a Bravyi--Poulin--Terhal-type tradeoff when the interaction range grows with system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories proposed to describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e., the momentum-space manifolds of Green's function zeros (GFZs) at zero energy, in strongly interacting fermionic systems. In particular, we focus on simplest possible cases associated with a gapless Dirac zero, which is the counterpart of the gapless Dirac quasiparticle in weakly interacting systems. These theories may be derived by integrating out low-energy degrees of freedom that do not couple to the relevant gauge field. We discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on phases consistent with the anomaly, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. Failing to avoid a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamical limit inevitably leads unstable GFZs. We also provide some perspectives on why the related nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied recently is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the atomic lattice and its interaction with the electronic band structure that facilitate charge ordering. However, CDWs are rarely observed in presence of Kondo screening and heavy fermion quasiparticles. The heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe$_2$. This allows for a refined identification of the nesting wavevectors in the electronic bandstructure. Although these wavevectors have no specific influence on the bulk properties, for example on antiferromagnetic fluctuations, they cause the interactions leading to the CDW at the surface. The heavy fermion hybridization pattern is spatially modulated specifically at the nesting wavevectors, suggesting that surface induced modifications in the U 5f electron valence enable a novel form of purely electron-driven charge ordering.</description>

Abstract: Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discovering new phenomena. In particular, advances in experimental techniques such as cold-atom measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as a function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model interpolating between the square and triangular lattices to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction, and temperature of the system are changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat, demonstrating interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atom experiments measurements at multiple temperatures. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its N-particle probability density and probability current density and successfully test on (non-Abelian) fractional quantum Hall states and chiral BCS wavefunction. Having reached overlaps as large as 99.9%, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as 25 particles and uncover distinctive features of the edge. Our work demonstrates efficient, scalable and accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.</description>

      <title>Defects in Wigner crystals: fracton-elasticity duality and vacancy proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions, their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in charged crystals.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in a correlated topological metal CoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Experimental confirmation of the magnetic ordering transition induced by an electronic structure change in the metallic triangular antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to \textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface (FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co 3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the charge-self-consistent DFT+DMFT band structures and the random phase approximation indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector (1/2,0,0) split into (1/6,0,0) and (1/2,0,0), which is consistent with the magnetic phase transition around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering Magnetism and Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Collinear Magnetic Structure in the Diamond Network Magnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic structure of EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions form a diamond network, was investigated using neutron and resonant X-ray diffraction on powder and single-crystal samples. The propagation vector was determined to be $\textbf{\textit{q}}_{\rm m}=(1,0,0)$~r.l.u. from these diffraction measurements. All possible magnetic structures in the space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ with this propagation vector were examined using the irreducible representation method and magnetic space group analysis. This magnetic structure was identified as a collinear antiferromagnetic structure with the magnetic space group $P_Inna$ (\#52.320) or $P_Inn2$ (\#34.164) under zero magnetic field. In these magnetic structure, frustration arises from competing magnetic interactions on the diamond network. These findings provide a concrete experimental reference for assessing the role of competing interactions in diamond-network magnets and motivate further studies of interaction-driven quantum states.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Topological Phase Transition in a Quantum Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha&lt;3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha&gt;3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time, remaining spatially uniform at each time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits. The implications of our results on the general stability of phase transitions and ordered phases to such temporal randomness are discussed.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain: Role of the system-bath coupling strength and timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the transport properties of quantum many-body systems is a central challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Theoretical studies usually rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in closed systems and boundary-driven dynamics governed by Markovian master equations for open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport coefficients obtained from these two classes of approaches remains a largely open question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ according to the two approaches, focusing on the specific example of magnetization transport in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain. Using exact numerical simulations for finite system sizes, we find (i) a clear mismatch between the two $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and (ii) a strong dependence of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ on the system-bath coupling strength for the open system, where neither (i) nor (ii) tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. These findings suggest limitations of the open-system approach to transport coefficients. To gain insight into the origin of (i) and (ii), we go beyond $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ and analyze the full time dependence of the diffusion coefficient $D(t)$ in the open system. In this way, we find that both (i) and (ii) vanish up to a finite time scale. While this time scale gradually increases with system size and tends to be macroscopic in the thermodynamic limit, this increase is still slow compared to the increase of the time to reach the steady state, where (i) and (ii) do not vanish. This observation can be seen as a wrong, yet unavoidable order of limits of long times first and large system sizes afterwards.</description>

Abstract: The layered compound $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ is a topological semimetal with Fermi arcs at the surface joining bulk Weyl points. Recent work has found signatures of surface superconductivity consisting of gap openings compatible with a critical temperature orders of magnitude larger than the bulk value. However, no superconducting vortices have been identified, raising questions about the robustness of the phase coherence. Here we use very low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and find robust superconductivity with T$_C=$2.9 K and H$_{C2}\approx$1.8 T linked to the Fermi arcs. We observe quantized superconducting vortices, demonstrating two-dimensional macroscopic quantum phase coherence.</description>

      <title>How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of C\'ordova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>

Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.</description>
