      <title>Some comparison results for one extension of the Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider generalizations of the drifted Laplacian and the Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci tensor, and we prove a version of the mean curvature comparison theorem. Consequently, we prove a Myers-type theorem and a generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem.</description>

      <title>The intersection of two real flag manifolds in a complex flag manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition for two real flag manifolds, which are not necessarily congruent, in a complex flag manifold to intersect transversally in terms of the symmetric triad. Then we show that the intersection of two real flag manifolds is antipodal. As an application, we prove that any real flag manifold in a complex flag manifold is a globally tight Lagrangian submanifold.</description>

      <title>Integral gradient estimates on a closed surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma, g)$ be a closed Riemann surface, and let $u$ be a weak solution to equation \[ - \Delta_g u = \mu, \] where $\mu$ is a signed Radon measure. We aim to establish $L^p$ estimates for the gradient of $u$ that are independent of the choice of the metric $g$. This is particularly relevant when the complex structure approaches the boundary of the moduli space. To this end, we consider the metric $g' = e^{2u} g$ as a metric of bounded integral curvature. This metric satisfies a so-called quadratic area bound condition, which allows us to derive gradient estimates for $g'$ in local conformal coordinates. From these estimates, we obtain the desired estimates for the gradient of $u$.</description>

      <title>Gluing doubly periodic Scherk surfaces into minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct minimal surfaces by stacking doubly periodic Scherk surfaces one above another and gluing them along their ends. It is previously known that the Karcher--Meeks--Rosenberg (KMR) doubly periodic minimal surfaces and Meeks' family of triply periodic minimal surfaces can both be obtained by gluing two Scherk surfaces. There have been hope and failed attempts to glue more Scherk surfaces. But our analysis shows that this is impossible: Such a glue construction can only produce the trivial Scherk surface itself, the KMR examples, and Meeks' surfaces.</description>

      <title>A note on helices in the Euclidean space and in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that general helices in Euclidean space for Killing vector fields associated to rotations are helices, that is, curves with constant curvature and constant torsion. In hyperbolic space $\h^3$, we obtain the parametrization of helices for the Killing vector fields associated to hyperbolic rotations, spherical rotations and parabolic rotations. It is proved that these helices are geodesics in suitable surfaces of $\h^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $\lambda$-translating solitons and $\lambda$-shrinkers of the Gauss curvature flow in Euclidean space. We prove that planes and circular cylinders are the only $\lambda$-translating solitons with constant mean curvature. We also prove that planes, spheres and circular cylinders are the only $\lambda$-shrinkers with constant mean curvature. We give a classification of the $\lambda$-translating solitons and $\lambda$-shrinkers with one constant principal curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the energy $E_\alpha[\Sigma]=\int_\Sigma |p|^\alpha\, d\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is a surface in Euclidean space $\r^3$ and $\alpha\in\r$. We prove that planes and spheres are the only stationary surfaces for $E_\alpha$ with constant Gauss curvature. We also characterize these surfaces assuming that a principal curvature is constant or that the mean curvature is constant.</description>

      <title>Minimal tori in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe tools for the study of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$; some are classical (the Gauss maps) and some are newer (the link/braid/writhe at infinity). Then we look for complete proper non holomorphic minimal tori with total curvature $-8\pi$ and a single end immersed in $\mathbb{R}^4$. We translate the problem into a system of $10$ quadratic or linear equations in $11$ real variables with coefficients in terms of the Weierstrass function $\wp$ and give explicit solutions for these equations if $T$ is a rectangular torus. For the square torus, we have a complete answer with a unique family of solutions generalizing the Chen-Gackstetter torus in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, we show that there is no solution on the equianharmonic torus.</description>

      <title>Search for Z/2 eigenfunctions on the sphere using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the 2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2 eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Stationary Integral Varifolds near Multiplicity 2 Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary integral $n$-varifolds $V$ in the unit ball $B_1(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$. Allard's regularity theorem establishes the existence of $\epsilon = \epsilon(n,k)\in (0,1)$ for which if $V$ is $\epsilon$-close (as varifolds) to the plane $P_0 = \{0\}^k\times\mathbb{R}^n$ with multiplicity 1 then, in $B_{1/2}(0)$, $V$ is represented by a single $C^{1,\alpha}$ minimal graph. However, when instead $P_0$ occurs with multiplicity $Q\in \{2,3,\dotsc\}$, simple examples show that this conclusion, now as a multi-valued graph, may fail, even if $V$ corresponds to an area-minimising rectifiable current.
  In the present work we investigate the structure of such $V$ which are close to planes with multiplicity $Q&gt;1$, focusing primarily on the case $Q=2$. We show that an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem holds when $V$ is close, as a varifold, to $P_0$ with multiplicity $2$, provided $V$ satisfies a certain topological structural condition on the part of its support where the density of $V$ is $&lt;2$. The conclusion then is that, in $B_{1/2}(0)$, $V$ is represented by the graph of a Lipschitz $2$-valued function over $P_0$ with small Lipschitz constant; in fact, the function is $C^{1,\alpha}$ in a precise generalised sense, and satisfies estimates, implying that all tangent cones at singular points in $B_{1/2}(0)$ are unique and comprised of stationary unions of $4$ half-planes (which may form a union of two distinct planes or a single multiplicity $2$ plane). The theorem does not require any additional assumption on the part of $V$ with density $\geq 2$ (which a priori may be a relatively large set in $\mathcal{H}^n$-measure with high topological complexity).
  As a corollary, we show that our $\epsilon$-regularity theorem applies unconditionally to stationary $2$-valued Lipschitz graphs with arbitrary Lipschitz constant, yielding improved regularity and uniform a priori estimates.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Volatility from the P\"oschl-Teller Potential and Hyperbolic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes a formal equivalence between the generalized Black-Scholes equation under a Quadratic Normal Volatility (QNV) specification and the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for a hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential. A sequence of canonical transformations maps the financial pricing operator to a quantum Hamiltonian, revealing the volatility smile as a direct manifestation of diffusion on a hyperbolic manifold whose geometry is classified by the discriminant of the QNV polynomial. We perform a complete spectral analysis of the financial Hamiltonian, deriving its discrete and continuous spectra and constructing the pricing kernel from the resulting eigenfunctions, which are given by classical special functions. This analytical framework, grounded in a gauge-theoretic perspective, furnishes a non-trivial benchmark for derivative pricing and provides a fundamental geometric interpretation of market anomalies. Future research trajectories toward integrable systems and formal field-theoretic analogies are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Levy Laplacian is an infinite-dimensional differential operator, which is interesting for its connection with the Yang-Mills gauge fields. The article proves the equivalence of various definitions of the Levy Laplacian on the manifold of $H^1$-paths on a Riemannian manifold. The heat equation with the Levy Laplacian is considered. The tendency of some solutions of this heat equation to the locally constant functionals as time tends to infinity is studied. These solutions are constructed using heat flows of differential forms on the compact Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method of symmetrization of mappings on the $n$-sphere ($n\geq 2$). They are applied to estimate solutions of quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations of $p$-Laplacian type, with combinations of Dirac measures on the right-hand side. The case $p=n$ is reduced to a problem on the sphere, using a conformal transformation. The cases when $1 &lt; p &lt; n $ and $p &gt; $n are considered more briefly, full details being available in other papers of the author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish new area-charge inequalities for the boundary of time-symmetric Einstein-Maxwell initial data sets, in both compact and noncompact cases, under the dominant energy condition. These inequalities lead to novel rigidity theorems with no analogues in the uncharged setting. In the noncompact case, our result is obtained by applying Gromov's $\mu$-bubble technique in a new geometric context.</description>

      <title>Positive mass theorems for spin initial data sets with arbitrary ends and dominant energy shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a positive mass theorem for spin initial data sets $(M,g,k)$ that contain an asymptotically flat end and a shield of dominant energy (a subset of $M$ on which the dominant energy scalar $\mu-|J|$ has a positive lower bound). In a similar vein, we show that for an asymptotically flat end $\mathcal{E}$ that violates the positive mass theorem (i.e. $\mathrm{E} &lt; |\mathrm{P}|$), there exists a constant $R&gt;0$, depending only on $\mathcal{E}$, such that any initial data set containing $\mathcal{E}$ must violate the hypotheses of Witten's proof of the positive mass theorem in an $R$-neighborhood of $\mathcal{E}$. This implies the positive mass theorem for spin initial data sets with arbitrary ends, and we also prove a rigidity statement. Our proofs are based on a modification of Witten's approach to the positive mass theorem involving an additional independent timelike direction in the spinor bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system on a principal bundle with a compact structure group over a compact manifold. We first construct, as an application of the general slice theorem of Diez and Rudolph, a smooth slice in the tame Fr\'echet category for the coupled action of bundle automorphisms on metrics and connections. Using this result, together with a careful analysis of the linearization of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, we realize the moduli space of Einstein-Yang-Mills pairs modulo automorphism as an analytic set in a finite-dimensional tame Fr\'echet manifold, extending classical results of Koiso for Einstein metrics and Yang-Mills connections to the Einstein-Yang-Mills system. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of \emph{essential deformation} of an Einstein-Yang-Mills pair, which we characterize in full generality and explore in more detail in the four-dimensional case, proving a decoupling result for trace deformations when the underlying Einstein-Yang-Mills pair is a Ricci-flat metric coupled to an anti-self-dual instanton. In particular, we find a novel obstruction that does not occur in the \emph{decoupled} Einstein or Yang-Mills moduli problems. Finally, we prove that every essential deformation of the four-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills system based on a Calabi-Yau metric coupled to an instanton is of restricted type.</description>

Abstract: We mainly show that for a conformal metric $g=u^{\frac{4}{n-2m}}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 2m+1$, if the higher order Q-curvature $Q^{(2m)}_g$ is positive and has slow decay barrier near infinity, the lower order Q-curvature $Q^{(2)}_g$ and $Q^{(4)}_g$ are both positive if $m$ is at least two.</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>

Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a very simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We assume the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature. We show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. We further assume that the metric $g$ is not degenerate in the sense that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive. With this extra assumption, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we also observe that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Topological Sigma Models and Doubling Spaces</title>

Abstract: Witten's topological B-model on a Calabi-Yau background is known to reproduce, in the open string sector, the derived category of coherent sheaves. When the target space is a complex torus, the topological model enjoys a non-geometric symmetry known as T-duality, which relates the theories on the torus and dual torus backgrounds. By considering the "double field theory" of Hull and Reid-Edwards on the product of a torus and its dual, T-duality occurs as a geometric symmetry of the target space.
  Building on the methods of Y. Qin, we propose a method of analyzing the topological B-model on a torus in the doubled geometry framework which naturally incorporates certain rank-one D-branes, providing a different perspective on the derived category of the torus. In certain cases, the intersection theory of these lifted branes correctly computes the BRST cohomology of the B-model, and hence the derived Hom-spaces of the corresponding line bundles.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Lie categories and Yang-Mills theory for multiplicative Ehresmann connections</title>

Abstract: The first and shorter part of this thesis deals with the structural assumption of invertibility in a Lie groupoid. When this assumption is dropped, we obtain the notion of a Lie category: a small category, endowed with a compatible differentiable structure. We introduce various examples of Lie categories, examine their differences and similarities with Lie groupoids, and research the notions emerging naturally from the lack of invertibility of arrows. The aim of the second and principal part of this thesis is to provide a far-reaching generalization of Yang-Mills theory, extending it from the classical setting of principal bundles to general Lie groupoids and algebroids. The notion of a principal bundle connection is now replaced with that of a more general multiplicative Ehresmann connection. In obtaining this generalization, we make various advances to the theory of such connections, as well as invariant linear connections on representations. We develop the obstruction classes for their existence, generalize the (horizontal) exterior covariant derivative to the representation-valued Bott-Shulman-Stasheff and Weil complexes, and inspect their relationship with the van Est map. We research the class of multiplicative connections with cohomologically trivial curvature, which are central to obtaining the desired generalization. Applying the variational principle to this framework rests upon our developed formulae for affine deformations of multiplicative connections. Ultimately, we develop the extension of Yang-Mills theory to a non-integrable and non-transitive setting: the classical Yang-Mills equation is upgraded to a gauge-invariant pair of equations, which now describe the dynamics of gauge fields in both the longitudinal and transversal directions with respect to the (singular) orbit foliation. As an example, we obtain a Yang-Mills theory for $S^1$-bundle gerbes.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Compact Calabi--Yau Conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal K\"ahler space whose canonical sheaf is a rank-one free $\mathcal O_X$ module and whose singularities are isolated, rational and quasi-homogeneous. We prove then that under a topological hypothesis the obstruction to deforming $X$ concentrates upon its singularities, generalizing partially the results of Namikawa--Gross. We prove also that under a certain hypothesis the locally trivial deformations of $X$ are unobstructed.</description>

      <title>On differential smoothness of certain Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the differential smoothness of various five-dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. By analyzing the relationship between the number of generators and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, we provide structural obstructions to differential smoothness in specific algebraic families. In particular, we prove that certain two- and four-generator AS-regular algebras of global dimension five fail to admit a differential calculus, while a five-generator graded Clifford algebra provides a contrasting positive example.</description>
