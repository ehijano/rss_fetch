      <title>Holographic Interfaces in Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of non-local operators in gauge theory and holography, such as line-operators or interfaces, has attracted significant attention. Two-dimensional symmetric product orbifolds are close cousins of higher-dimensional gauge theory. In this work, we construct a novel family of interfaces in symmetric product orbifolds. These may be regarded as two-dimensional analogues of Wilson-line operators or Karch-Randall interfaces at the same time. The construction of the interfaces entails the choice of boundary conditions of the seed theory. For a generic seed theory, we construct the boundary states associated to the interfaces via the folding trick, compute their overlaps and extract the spectrum of interface changing operators through modular transformation. Then, we specialise to the supersymmetric four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ and show that the corresponding interfaces of the symmetric product orbifold are dual to $AdS_2$ branes in the tensionless limit of type IIB superstring theory on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$.</description>

      <title>On Infinite Tensor Networks, Complementary Recovery and Type II Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of local operator algebras at the boundary of infinite tensor networks, using the mathematical theory of inductive limits. In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Gravity in Enhanced Brane-World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize and extend results on the localization of gravity on Karch-Randall-Sundrum brane-worlds with positive, negative, or zero cosmological constant on the brane. We do so both from the study of bulk metric perturbations, and from their reinterpretation through brane-world holography: an induced higher-derivative theory of gravity coupled to a cut-off CFT on the brane. We then enhance these models by adding an explicit Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane action (i.e. a DGP term) and, through studying the brane position and the localization of gravity on the brane, we establish bounds for its coupling constant, beyond which the theory presents pathologies. We finally study the limit in which the brane reaches the boundary, and comment on adding further higher-derivative terms on the brane action.</description>

      <title>Extended Bargmann FDA and non-relativistic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the construction of a free differential algebra as an extension of the extended Bargmann algebra in arbitrary dimensions. This is achieved by introducing a new Maurer-Cartan equation for a three-form gauge multiplet in the adjoint representation of the extended Bargmann algebra. The new Maurer-Cartan equation is provided of non-triviality by means of the introduction of a four-form cocycle, representative of a Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology class. We derive the corresponding dual $L_{\infty}$ algebra and, by using the formalism of non-linear realizations, propose a five-dimensional gauge invariant action principle. Then, we derive the corresponding equations of motion and study how the presence of the three-form gauge fields and the four-cocycle modify the corresponding non-relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Time and its Quantum Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that the problem of time should not be regarded as an issue to be resolved within the prevailing framework for studying quantum gravity, but rather as an indication that there is an issue within the framework itself. We suggest a possible resolution inspired by the observation that the quantization of gravity on null hypersurfaces leads to an anomaly, in that the constraint algebra is projectively represented in the quantum theory. We describe how accommodating these anomalies forces the theory to replace the standard interpretation of canonical time evolution with a fully quantum, diffeomorphism invariant notion of time. The full theory admits states that can be interpreted as emergent geometric spacetime regions which we refer to as quantum diamonds.</description>

      <title>Fermions in $(1+2)$-dimensions modified by nonminimal coupling and its applications to condensed matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermions in two-dimensional space, commonly called $(1+2)$-dimensional fermions, exhibit intriguing and distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from their higher-dimensional counterparts. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical examination of planar fermionic systems, presenting novel findings by incorporating nonminimal coupling. Our analysis includes the computation of the non-relativistic limit up to second-order corrections in the Dirac equation. We also explore the Schr\"odinger equation under the influence of a harmonic potential and an electric field. Furthermore, we investigate how the coupling parameter affects physical properties relevant to condensed matter systems. Our results demonstrate that this parameter significantly impacts electronic properties and Hall conductivity. The interplay between an external electric field and the coupling parameter also influences energy levels and the system's polarizability. These findings underscore the novel effects of including nonminimal coupling in wave equations, offering new insights into the physics of coupled systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the question of conformal boundary conditions in the compact free boson CFT in two dimensions. Besides the well-known Neumann and Dirichlet cases, there is an additional proposed one-parameter family of boundary states when the radius is an irrational multiple of the self-dual radius. These additional states have a continuous open string spectrum, and we give an explicit formula for the density of states. We also point out several pathologies of these states, chiefly that they have a divergent g-function.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of black holes with cloud of strings and quintessence via Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence to study thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology in the presence of Barrow entropy, which is currently being used widely as the horizon of a black hole may not be a smooth surface as described in classical general relativity but instead could have a more intricate fractal-like structure. Here, we study the impact of the fractal correction parameter of Barrow entropy on the thermodynamics of such BHs. We compute the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr relation for RN-AdS black hole with a cloud of string and quintessence in terms of \bre~ by employing the generalized formula for spherically symmetric spacetime which is directly derived from the Einstein field equation. The significance of Barrow entropy has been verified from thermodynamic topology as well. We also found that the non-zero topological charge indicates the presence of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Energy Landscapes from Iyer-Wald Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized free energy landscape plays a pivotal role in understanding black hole thermodynamics and phase transitions. In general relativity, one can directly derive the generalized free energy from the contributions of black holes exhibiting conical singularities. In this work, we extend this idea to general covariant theories. By employing Noether's second theorem, we present an alternative formulation of the Lagrangian, which can elucidate the role of conical singularities. We demonstrate that, in general, the contribution from conical singularities depends on the specific implementation of the regularization scheme and is not uniquely determined; this feature is explicitly exhibited and confirmed in three-dimensional new massive gravity. Nevertheless, these ambiguities can be absorbed into the second-order (and higher) corrections induced by conical singularities when the gravitational theory is described by the Lagrangian $L(g_{ab},R_{abcd})$. Moreover, for certain theories such as general relativity and Bumblebee gravity, this contribution simplifies to a well-defined result. However, the interpretation of the generalized free energy in Bumblebee gravity is somewhat different, with its extrema corresponding to the geometry of conical singularities. Our results uncover the particular properties of the generalized free energy beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a Non-Commutative Black Hole under the Influence of a Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the shadow cast by a black hole in a non-commutative spacetime surrounded by a plasma medium. Black holes in a plasma environment can exhibit complex interactions that profoundly affect their shadow properties. In specific terms, we consider a special type of plasma medium motivated from the interactions among axions, photons and plasma excitations, or commonly termed as axion-plasmon in the presence of a magnetic field. We have studied the effect of these plasma parameters and the non-commutative parameter on the shadow properties by focusing particularly the photon sphere radius, angular shadow and the shadow observed from the observer's perspective. For this we have considered two different forms of plasma \emph{viz.} homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma. In this work we have presented the parameter dependence of these BH shadow properties.</description>

      <title>De Sitter vacuum on nucleated D-branes with stringy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) vacuum solutions on probe D-branes which nucleate in an asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5\times T^{1,1}$ background, including stringy corrections. A sufficiently high chemical potential induced by the wrapped D3-brane charge, breaking supersymmetry in the bulk, is essential to lead to the nucleation of the probe D-brane. We show that stringy corrections can yield a dS vacuum on a spherical D3-brane consistent with the observations without being fine-tuned. Motivated by the fact that the matter fields propagating in the compact extra dimensions can provide solutions for problems in particle physics and cosmology, we also construct a dS vacuum on a probe D5-brane which wraps on a two-torus of the internal manifold $T^{1,1}$. This construction requires turning on a worldvolume U(1) gauge field along the wrapped part of the D5-brane and dissolving some D3-branes in it. The stringy corrections play an important role in yielding a dS vacuum and the field strength of the U(1) gauge field must be sufficiently large to produce a tiny cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>On the Seven-loop Renormalization of Gross-Neveu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of an infinite number of marginal four-fermion operators is a key characteristic of the two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. In this study, we investigate the structure of UV divergences in this model, and by symmetry argument we found that the renormalizability only requires a subset of evanescent operators. We perform a 7-loop renormalization computation of beta function for the corresponding evanescent operator, and confirm its non-trivial contribution to UV divergences. This computation has been made possible primarily by the technical advancements in graphical function method and the computational realizations of traditional techniques. For this purpose, we have extended the graphical function method, which has been predominantly used in scalar theories, to a model with fermions at 7-loops. Additionally, we have applied some traditional methods to accommodate theories with spinning particles, such as the equivalent operations for extracting UV divergences, the dimensional shifting relations and the large momentum expansion. Our result represents the first time that beta functions have been computed analytically beyond 5-loop in a model with spinning particles.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mirror Axion Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an axion soliton, which weakly interacts with background matter and magnetic fields. A mirror-symmetric soliton, for which the magnetic flow is due to secondary magnetic helicity invariant, is described by the Iroshnikov-Kreichnan spectrum. For a large-scale magnetic field dynamo is not observed. In a mirror axionic soliton, a phase transition, which produces a magnetic helical flow, is possible. Using this transition, the soliton becomes mirror-asymmetric. When the mirror symmetry is broken, the axion soliton allows the magnetic energy, which is the result of the transformation of the axionic energy. In the main result, for an initial stage of the process, we calculate a scale for which the generation of large scale magnetic fields is the most intense. By making numerical simulations, we received that lower lateral harmonics of the magnetic field have greater amplitudes compared to higher ones. A simplest statistical ensemble, which is defined by the projection of all harmonics onto principal harmonics is constructed. We put forward an assumption that it was the indication to some instability in axionic MHD. Now, we can provide a possible explanation of this feature. When the mirror symmetry of the axion soliton is broken, the $\gamma$-term in the axionic mean field equation interacts with principal harmonics. As the result, the axion soliton acquires the magnetic energy and becomes helical.</description>

      <title>The phase of the gravitational path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00900</link>

Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

      <title>Physical instabilities and the phase of the Euclidean path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the phase of the Euclidean gravity partition function on manifolds of the form $S^p \times M_q$. We find that the total phase is equal to the phase in pure gravity on $S^p$ times an extra phase that arises from negative mass squared fields that we obtain when we perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction to $S^p$. The latter can be matched to the phase expected for physical negative modes seen by a static path observer in $dS_p$. In the case of $S^p \times S^q$ the answer can be interpreted in terms of a computation in the static patch of $dS_p$ or $dS_q$. We also provide the phase when we have a product of many spheres. We clarify the procedure for determining the precise phase factor. We discuss some aspects of the interpretation of this phase.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a Proca field in Schwarzschild-AdS$_5$ spacetime via the isomonodromy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Proca field perturbations in a five-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter (Schwarzschild-AdS$_{5}$) black hole geometry. Using the vector spherical harmonic (VSH) method, we show that the Proca field decomposes into scalar-type and vector-type components according to their tensorial behavior on the three-sphere. Two degrees of freedom of the field are described by scalar-type components, which are coupled due to the mass term, while the remaining two degrees of freedom are described by a vector-type component, which decouples completely. Motivated by the Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos (FKKS) ansatz in the limit of zero spin, we use a field transformation to decouple the scalar-type components at the expense of introducing a complex separation parameter $\beta$. This parameter can be determined analytically, and its values correspond to two distinct polarizations of the scalar-type sector: "electromagnetic" and "non-electromagnetic", denoted by $\beta_{+}$ and $\beta_{-}$, respectively. In the scalar-type sector, the radial differential equation for each polarization is a Fuchsian differential equation with five singularities, whereas in the vector-type sector, the radial equation has four singularities. By means of the isomonodromy method, we reformulate the boundary value problem in terms of the initial conditions of the Painlev\'{e} VI $\tau$ function and, using a series expansion of the $\tau$ function, we compute the scalar-type and vector-type quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the small horizon limit. Our results are in overall very good agreement with those obtained via the numerical integration method. This shows that the isomonodromy method is a reliable method to compute quasinormal modes in the small horizon limit with high accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly curved spacetimes of compact astrophysical objects are known to possess light rings (null circular geodesics) with {\it discrete} radii on which massless particles can perform closed circular motions. In the present compact paper, we reveal for the first time the existence of isotropic curved spacetimes that possess light disks which are made of a {\it continuum} of closed light rings. In particular, using analytical techniques which are based on the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations, we prove that these physically intriguing spacetimes contain a central compact core of radius $r_-&gt;0$ that supports an outer spherical shell with an infinite number (a continuum) of null circular geodesic which are all characterized by the functional relations $4\pi r^2_{\gamma}p(r_{\gamma})=1-3m(r_{\gamma})/r_{\gamma}$ and $8\pi r^2_{\gamma}(\rho+p)=1$ for $r_{\gamma}\in[r_-,r_+]$ [here $\{\rho,p\}$ are respectively the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the self-gravitating matter fields and $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within the sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of the pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at the tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced when there exists an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible probes on this using fifth-force search and atomic spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the B-L gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during B-L symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <title>Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole in AdS space-time surrounded by quintessence: geodesic, shadow and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel exact solution to the gravitational field equations, known as the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia black hole solution, set against the backdrop of anti-de Sitter space and surrounded by a quintessence field. This solution serves as an interpolation between three distinct anti-de Sitter black hole configurations, namely, the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia, Schwarzschild-Kiselev, and the standard Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The first aspect of our investigation focuses on the geodesic motion of particles, where we explore how the black hole's space-time geometry-incorporating the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics, the quintessence field, and the curvature radius-influences the dynamics of both massless and massive particles near the black hole. To further enrich our analysis, we extend the study to include the perturbative dynamics of a massless scalar field within the black hole solution, placing special emphasis on the scalar perturbative potential. Subsequently, we focus into the phenomenon of black hole shadows, examining how various parameters, such as the nonlinear electrodynamics, the curvature of space-time and the presence of the quintessence field, impact the size and shape of the shadow cast by the black hole. In the final segment of our study, we shift our attention to the thermodynamics of the black hole solution. We compute several essential thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, specific heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, analyzing how these properties evolve in response to changes in the various parameters that define the space-time geometry, which in turn affect the gravitational field when compared to the traditional black hole</description>

      <title>Is the information loss problem a paradox?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is twofold. First, we introduce the information loss problem; second, we provide a critical assessment by thoroughly inspecting the assumptions underlying its formulations. In particular, we argue that if we work in the regime of validity of semiclassical gravity and do not add additional assumptions that are not necessary for the Hawking calculation, the answer to the question in the title is NO. In other words, the black hole evaporation is certainly unitary as predicted by quantum field theory in curved spacetime. However, if additional assumptions are added, such as a universal area bound on the entropy, contradictions may arise even in regimes where we would expect the semiclassical approximation to be valid. We show that a contradiction indeed arises, but not between the laws of semiclassical general relativity and quantum mechanics, but rather between the former and the additional (holographic) requirement of the area limit, according to which an exterior observer describes a black hole as a quantum system whose entropy is bounded by its area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the liquid gas transition of nuclear matter in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the liquid-gas transition of nuclear matter can be rigorously described with the quantum chromodynamics by combining the quark gap equation and the Faddeev equation of nucleon. Our investigation focuses on this transition at zero temperature and finite chemical potential, revealing a finite difference between the gas and liquid solution of the quark propagator. This difference emerges from the shift of the nucleon pole mass in medium, which is generated in the nucleon channel of the quark gap equation. We prove that such a difference is precisely the contour contribution from the shift of the nucleon pole. The resulting discontinuity manifests as a first-order phase transition and fundamentally determines both the nuclear binding energy and the saturation density. We then derive an analytical relation between the binding energy and the sigma term of the nucleon, yielding a binding energy of $E/A=15.9\,\textrm{MeV}$. Furthermore, by establishing the relation between the nuclear saturation density and the vector charge of nucleon in association with the binding energy, we determine the saturation density to be $n_{\textrm{B}}^{0}=0.15\,\textrm{fm}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at the first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of generating a cosmic inflation without any big bang singularity. It has been proved recently by Good and Linder (arXiv : 2503.02380v1) that such an expansion of the universe can be driven by quantum fluctuations embedded in vacuum. The rate of expansion is guided by a cosmological sum rule defined through the Schwarzian derivative. We explore the thermodynamic roots of Schwarzian and connect it with the surface gravity associated with an apparent horizon. In General Relativity the cosmological sum rule can be enforced only if the early universe is a Milne vacuum. We show that this restriction can be removed by considering an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Lepton-proton two-photon exchange with improved soft-photon approximation including proton's structure effects in HB$\chi$PT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved evaluation of the two-photon exchange correction to the unpolarized lepton-proton elastic scattering process at very low-energies relevant to the MUSE experiment, where only the dominant intermediate elastic proton is considered. We employ the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and invoke the soft-photon approximation in order to reduce the intricate 4-point loop-integrals into simpler 3-point loop-integrals. In the present work, we adopt a more robust methodology compared to an earlier work along the same lines for analytically evaluating the loop-integrations, and incorporate important corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order. These include the proton's structure effects which renormalize the proton-photon interaction vertices and the proton's propagator. Finally, our results allow a model-independent estimation of the charge asymmetry for the scattering of unpolarized massive leptons and anti-leptons.</description>

      <title>Universal critical behavior of generaliezd susceptibilities of net-baryon number at small quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the limit of small quark masses, the angle between the temperature axis and the applied magnetic field direction in the three-dimensional Ising model vanishes as $m_q^{2/5}$ when mapped onto the QCD $T-\mu_B$ phase plane. By selecting two distinct small angles and projecting the Ising model results onto QCD, we have investigated the universal critical behavior of the sixth-, eighth-, and tenth-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon number. When considering only the leading critical contribution, the negative dip in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the generalized susceptibilities is not universal, in contrast to the observation in the case where the angle is $90^{\circ}$. Its existence depends on the mapping parameters and the distance to the phase transition line. After incorporating the sub-leading critical contribution, the negative dip is enhanced to some extent but remains a non-robust feature. In contrast, the positive peak structure persists in all cases and represents a robust characteristic of generalized susceptibilities of the net-baryon number near the critical point.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

      <title>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Topological Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we shall consider the effects of a non-trivial topology on the effective potential of the Standard Model. Specifically we shall assume that the spacetime topology is $S^1\times R^3$ and we shall calculate the Standard Model effective potential for such a topological spacetime. As we demonstrate, for small values of the compact dimension radius, the electroweak symmetry is unbroken, but for a critical length and beyond, the electroweak symmetry is broken, since the configuration space of the Higgs field contains an additional energetically favorable minimum, compared to the minimum at the origin. The two minima are separated by a barrier, thus a phase transition can occur, via quantum tunnelling, which mimics a first order phase transition. This is a non-thermal phase transition, similar possibly to quantum Hall topological phase transitions, hence in the context of this scenario, the electroweak symmetry breaking does not require a high temperature to occur. The present scenario does not rely on the occurrence of the inflationary era, only on the expansion of the Universe, however we briefly discuss the freezing of the superhorizon terms in $S^1\times R^3$ spacetime, if inflation occurred. We also investigate the large scale differences of the gravitational potential due to the non-trivial topology. Finally, we briefly mention the distinct inequivalent topological field configurations that can exist due to the non-trivial topology, which are classified by the first Stieffel class which in the case at hand is $H^{1}(S^{1}{\times R}^{3},Z_{\widetilde{2}})=Z_2$, so even and odd elements can exist. We also briefly qualitatively discuss how a topologically induced electroweak phase transition can yield primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-model approach to flavor models: A case study for $S_4^\prime$ modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method of searching for parameters with experimental constraints in generic flavor models by utilizing diffusion models, which are classified as a type of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). As a specific example, we consider the $S_4^\prime$ modular flavor model and construct a neural network that reproduces quark masses, the CKM matrix, and the Jarlskog invariant by treating free parameters in the flavor model as generating targets. By generating new parameters with the trained network, we find various phenomenologically interesting parameter regions where an analytical evaluation of the $S_4^\prime$ model is challenging. Additionally, we confirm that the spontaneous CP violation occurs in the $S_4^\prime$ model. The diffusion model enables an inverse problem approach, allowing the machine to provide a series of plausible model parameters from given experimental data. Moreover, it can serve as a versatile analytical tool for extracting new physical predictions from flavor models.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrating a Black Hole with Inhomogeneous Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum quench processes in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in which the initial thermal equilibrium (Gibbs) state is time-evolved by spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, the so-called M\"obius and sine-square-deformed (SSD) Hamiltonians. We found that, when the quench is induced by the SSD Hamiltonian, almost all the degrees of freedom are asymptotically gathered at a single point, resulting in a point-like excitation. This excitation, which we dub black hole-like excitation, carries as much information as the total thermal entropy. In contrast, other parts of the system approach the low-entropy (low-temperature) state at late times. For the quench by the M\"obius Hamiltonian, we instead found an eternal periodic oscillation of physical quantities such as von Neumann entropy for subsystems. When the CFT admits a holographic dual description, the SSD quench induces a time-dependent, inhomogeneous deformation of the bulk black hole horizon, which, at late enough times, ``touches'' the boundary. Our quench setups can be used as a way to create low-temperature states, and, also, simulate the formation and evaporation processes of black holes.</description>

Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

Abstract: We start by defining two-particle operators that appear in celestial CFT. We then show how to compute their OPE coefficients with the known single-particle operators at tree level from multiparticle factorization channels, focusing on the leading contribution involving the two-particle states. These factorization channels only give us single-particle exchanges. To extract the multiparticle exchanges, we look at the $\overline{\rm MHV}$ gluon amplitudes and show how non-factorization channels contribute to two-particle terms in the single-helicity sector. This is a first step towards systematically computing the full celestial OPE.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit \cite{Lin:2022nss}. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature \cite{Witten:2023xze}, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from \cite{Lin:2022rbf}. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers and for arbitrary global physical states), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the `observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytic continuations of holographic entanglement entropy in which the boundary subregion extends along a timelike direction have brought a promise of a novel, time-centric probe of the emergence of spacetime. We propose that the bulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are boundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of holographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only provides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct analytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement entropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study holographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the investigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the boundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal surfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical contribution.</description>

Abstract: We study the correlators of bulk and defect half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with a Maldacena-Wilson line defect, focusing on the case involving one bulk and two defect local operators. We analyze the non-perturbative constraints on these correlators, which include a topological sector, pinching and splitting limits, as well as a compatibility with expanding in superconformal blocks. Using these constraints, we compute a variety of bulk-defect-defect correlators up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling, and observe that transcendental terms cancel. Additionally, we study the two leading terms in the strong-coupling regime, and present partial results for the next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Axio-dilaton Dark Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for scattering of dilatons in type IIB string theory with pure RR flux on $AdS_3\times S^3\times M_4$ for $M_4=T^4$ or $K3$, to all orders in $\alpha'$ in a small AdS curvature expansion. This is achieved by comparing the flat space limit of the dual D1D5 CFT correlator to an ansatz for the amplitude as a worldsheet integral in terms of single valued multiple polylogarithms. The first curvature correction is fully fixed in this way, and satisfies consistency checks in the high energy limit, and by comparison of the energy of massive string operators to a semiclassical expansion. Our result gives infinite predictions for CFT data in the planar limit at strong coupling, which can guide future integrability studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic symmetries of near-horizon extremal BTZ black holes in higher derivative theories of gravity, such as New Massive Gravity and Topological Massive Gravity. By employing a particular boundary condition and the regularization prescription proposed earlier for the Einstein gravity, we demonstrate the existence of two centrally extended Virasoro algebras. The central charges evaluated within this framework are in agreement with their corresponding expressions evaluated at the spatial infinity. We also discuss the robustness of the regularization procedure by relating asymptotic and near-horizon geometries.</description>

Abstract: Coupling $N$ large $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs which are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. In this paper, we build on the construction of [1], establishing that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed points. Along the way, we develop a finer understanding of the spectrum of these theories, of the special properties of the $N=4$ case and of non-invertible symmetries that constrain them. We also discuss variations of the original setup of [1] some of which can exist for smaller values of the UV central charge.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Flat Ten or Eleven Dimensional Space-time in the Interior of an Asymptotically Flat Four Dimensional String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience type IIA string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time. By taking another solution in the same theory, one can create an arbitrarily large region where a local observer will experience type IIB string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum M2-branes in holographic backgrounds and show that their moduli spaces of zero-modes are localised according to an R-symmetry Killing vector. We discuss the relation with recent results in the context of equivariant localisation in gauged supergravity and argue its origin within M-theory path integrals expanded in saddle points over M2-branes. We argue that the M2-brane partition function, including its non-perturbative corrections, should be compared to the field theory grand canonical partition function. Our results extend recent observations in the context of the giant graviton expansion of superconformal indices to generic supersymmetric AdS boundary conditions. As a byproduct we predict non-perturbative corrections to a variety of supersymmetric observables of the ABJM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study modular symmetries in non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories on toroidal backgrounds with Wilson line modulus, constructed by stringy Scherk-Schwartz compactification. In particular, we focus on a subgroup of the T-duality group $O(D+16,D,\mathbb{Z})$ with $D=2$ given by an outer automorphism of the Narain lattice, which can be mapped to the Siegel modular group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{Z})$. We classify the modular symmetries and a $CP$-like symmetry on $T^2$ and its orbifolds with symmetric and asymmetric orbifold twists. It turns out that the non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories only enjoy a part of modular symmetries in contrast to supersymmetric ones. Furthermore, the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced at fixed points of modular symmetries on $T^2$ on which we analyze the vacuum structure of eight-dimensional tachyon-free vacua.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum energy inequality (QEI) for quantum field theories formulated in non-commutative spacetimes, extending fundamental energy constraints to this generalized geometric framework. By leveraging operator-theoretic methods inspired by the positivity map of Waldmann et al. \cite{waldmannpos}, we construct linear combinations of deformed operators that generalize the commutative spacetime techniques of Fewster et al., \cite{Few98}. These non-commutative analogs enable us the derivation of a lower bound on the deformed averaged energy density, ensuring the stability of the underlying quantum field theory. Our result establishes rigorous constraints on the expectation values of the deformed (non-commutative) energy density, reinforcing the physical consistency of non-commutative models while preserving core principles of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the basic theory of mimetic gravity by extending its purview to the general metric-compatible geometries that admit torsion, in addition to curvature. This essentially implies reinstating the mimetic principle of isolating the conformal degree of freedom of gravity in presence of torsion, by parametrizing both the physical metric and torsion in terms of the scalar `mimetic' field and the metric and torsion of a fiducial space. We assert the requisite torsion parametrization from an inspection of the fiducial space Cartan transformation which, together with the conformal transformation of the fiducial metric, preserve the physical metric and torsion. In formulating the scalar-tensor equivalent Lagrangian, we consider an explicit contact coupling of the mimetic field with torsion, so that the former can manifest itself geometrically as the source of a torsion mode, and most importantly, give rise to a viable `dark universe' picture from a mimicry of an evolving dust-like cosmological fluid with a non-zero pressure. A further consideration of higher derivatives of the mimetic field in the Lagrangian leads to physical bounds on the mimetic-torsion coupling strength, which we determine explicitly.</description>

      <title>Mimetic-Metric-Torsion with induced Axial mode and Phantom barrier crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the basic formalism of mimetic-metric-torsion gravity theory, in a way that the mimetic scalar field can manifest itself geometrically as the source of not only the trace mode of torsion, but also its axial (or, pseudo-trace) mode. Specifically, we consider the mimetic field to be (i) coupled explicitly to the well-known Holst extension of the Riemann-Cartan action, and (ii) identified with the square of the associated Barbero-Immirzi field, which is presumed to be a pseudo-scalar. The conformal symmetry originally prevalent in the theory would still hold, as the associated Cartan transformations do not affect the torsion pseudo-trace, and hence the Holst term. Demanding the theory to preserve the spatial parity symmetry as well, we focus on a geometric unification of the cosmological dark sector, and show that a super-accelerating regime in the course of evolution of the universe is always feasible. From the observational perspective, assuming the cosmological evolution profile to be very close to that for $\L$CDM, we further show that there could be a smooth crossing of the so-called phantom barrier at a low red-shift, however for a very restricted parametric domain. The extent of the super-acceleration have subsequently been ascertained by examining the evolution of the relevant torsion parameters.</description>

For these tau-functions we construct the canonical Kac--Schwarz operators, quantum spectral curves, and $W^{(3)}$-constraints. For the simplest representative we construct the cut-and-join operators, which describe the algebraic version of the topological recursion. We also investigate a one-parametric generalization of the higher Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of any vacuum extremal horizon must admit a Killing vector field. If the cross-sections are two-dimensional spheres, this implies that the most general solution is the extremal Kerr horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant. Furthermore, we also deduce that any non-trivial vacuum near-horizon geometry, with a non-positive cosmological constant, must have a Lie algebra of Killing vector fields that contains $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\times \mathfrak{u}(1)$ in all dimensions under no symmetry assumptions. We also show that, if the cross-sections are two-dimensional, the horizon Einstein equation is equivalent to a single fourth order PDE for the K\"ahler potential, and that this equation is explicitly solvable on the sphere if the corresponding metric admits a Killing vector.</description>

      <title>EFT matching from analyticity and unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new on-shell method for the matching of ultraviolet models featuring massive states onto their massless effective field theory. We employ a dispersion relation in the space of complex momentum dilations to capture, in a single variable, the relevant analytic structure of scattering amplitudes at any multiplicity. Multi-variate complex analysis and crossing considerations are therefore avoided. Remarkably, no knowledge about the infrared effective field theory is required in dimensional regularisation. All matching information is extracted from the residues and discontinuities of the ultraviolet scattering amplitudes, which unitarity expresses in terms of lower-point and lower-loop results, respectively. This decomposition into simpler building blocks could deliver new insights in the structure of the effective field theories obtained from classes of ultraviolet scenarios and facilitate computations at higher loop orders.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors by Squeezed Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive-Operator-Valued-Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, 0 = 0, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories and their classical interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we postulate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities, identifying those quantization prescriptions for which this holds true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GWs due to the density fluctuation in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering of massive scalar field due to magnetically charged rotating black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are well known to amplify the perturbing bosonic fields in certain parameter spaces. This phenomenon is popularly known as superradiance. In addition to rotation in the spacetime, charge plays a crucial role in the amplification process. In the present study, we have considered the spacetime of a magnetically charged rotating black hole emerging from the coupling of nonlinear electromagnetic field configuration to gravity. Due to this black hole spacetime, we have studied the scattering states of a massive scalar field and investigated the superradiant amplification process. We find that the magnetic charge of the spacetime affects the magnitude of the amplification and also significantly enlarges the allowed frequency ranges for which superradiance happens. In comparison, our analysis reveals that some of the behaviours are quite similar to what has been found in the case of the Kerr-Newmann black hole. Moreover, in specific parameter spaces, we observe exact similarities, which could imply a probable correspondence between the magnetically charged black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole in certain scenarios. In addition to this, we have investigated the superradiant instability regime due to the massive potential barrier and also compared our results with that of the Kerr-Newmann black hole.</description>

      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Low-curvature quantum corrections from unitary evolution of de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel manifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a two-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the metric as effective couplings are obtained in a one-loop approximation. Normal coordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of the metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed point common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the general case, or its absence in the case of an Abelian structure group, is established. For the tetracritical point, the critical exponents are evaluated and compared with those known earlier for a simpler particular case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime, but rather as the finite-dimensional configuration space of a single "atom" of geometry). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a field-theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear and $n$th power of momentum along $d_L$ and $d_M$ mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space, respectively, with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a ``small" parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number) when in conjunction $d_L=1$. When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading-order RG analysis suggests the Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field-theoretic RG analysis yields the same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the modification of open charm hadrons and thereby implying the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover, which hints at the sequential melting of charmed hadrons. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

      <title>Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semimetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.</description>

It supports exact diagonalisation (ED) and density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculations. FuzzifiED can also apply to generic fermionic and bosonic models. This documentation provides a review of the fuzzy sphere regularisation and an instruction for using FuzzifiED for numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational corrections to Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole thermodynamics and their implications for the weak gravity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we investigate the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within the framework of effective field theory. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at the one-loop level. We perform a complete thermodynamic analysis for both non-extremal and extremal black holes. For non-extremal black holes, we identify a relationship between the shift in the charge-to-mass ratio and the thermodynamic stability of the black holes. For extremal black holes, we show that quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes, which aligns with known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>
