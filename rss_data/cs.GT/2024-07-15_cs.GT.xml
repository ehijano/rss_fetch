      <title>Popular Maximum-Utility Matchings with Matroid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate weighted settings of popular matching problems with matroid constraints. The concept of popularity was originally defined for matchings in bipartite graphs, where vertices have preferences over the incident edges. There are two standard models depending on whether vertices on one or both sides have preferences. A matching $M$ is popular if it does not lose a head-to-head election against any other matching. In our generalized models, one or both sides have matroid constraints, and a weight function is defined on the ground set. Our objective is to find a popular optimal matching, i.e., a maximum-weight matching that is popular among all maximum-weight matchings satisfying the matroid constraints. For both one- and two-sided preferences models, we provide efficient algorithms to find such solutions, combining algorithms for unweighted models with fundamental techniques from combinatorial optimization. The algorithm for the one-sided preferences model is further extended to a model where the weight function is generalized to an M$^\natural$-concave utility function. Finally, we complement these tractability results by providing hardness results for the problems of finding a popular near-optimal matching. These hardness results hold even without matroid constraints and with very restricted weight functions.</description>

      <title>Identity Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of cryptocurrencies introduced revolutionary concepts, yet faced challenges in privacy and regulatory compliance. While subsequent cryptocurrencies aimed to address privacy concerns (like Zcash and Monero), they often conflicted with regulatory frameworks, hindering broader adoption. In response, inspired by recent researches about privacy and accountability and incentive techniques in Blockchain, we propose IdentityChain as a novel framework that integrates privacy and accountability principles, leading to a robust system equipped with adaptable rules.
  IdentityChain is a KYC (Know Your Customer) service on top of a public Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Ton, Polygon). The goal is to maintain privacy while ensuring compliance with existing regulations. Privacy is one of the key characteristics of IdentityChain, it's crucial for preventing conflicts of interests further discussed how. Accountability is also one of the main characteristics of IdentityChain and prevents from misbehave of users. Privacy and accountability together wouldn't be possible unless advancements in cryptography.</description>

      <title>A pragmatic policy learning approach to account for users' fatigue in repeated auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising banners are sold in real-time through auctions.Typically, the more banners a user is shown, the smaller the marginalvalue of the next banner for this user is. This fact can be detected bybasic ML models, that can be used to predict how previously won auctionsdecrease the current opportunity value. However, learning is not enough toproduce a bid that correctly accounts for how winning the current auctionimpacts the future values. Indeed, a policy that uses this prediction tomaximize the expected payoff of the current auction could be dubbedimpatient because such policy does not fully account for the repeatednature of the auctions. Under this perspective, it seems that most biddersin the literature are impatient. Unsurprisingly, impatience induces a cost.We provide two empirical arguments for the importance of this cost ofimpatience. First, an offline counterfactual analysis and, second, a notablebusiness metrics improvement by mitigating the cost of impatience withpolicy learning</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dynamics of Employee Behavior Through Wolframs Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding employee behavior in a workplace is critical for enhancing overall organizational performance. Despite numerous efforts to improve work environments, many organizations still need help with challenges primarily rooted in unaddressed issues or poorly understood behavioral patterns. In this paper, we have focused on recognizing this pattern and the dynamics of complex systems in organizational behavior and studying how factors influence the systems overall behavior using Wolframs Cellular Automata theory. Over the cycle, we observe how leadership influences team dynamics, influences the organization, and drives employee behavior to foster a positive environment. Keywords: Cellular Automata, Employee Behavior, team dynamics, Leadership Influence.</description>

      <title>AlphaDou: High-Performance End-to-End Doudizhu AI Integrating Bidding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence for card games has long been a popular topic in AI research. In recent years, complex card games like Mahjong and Texas Hold'em have been solved, with corresponding AI programs reaching the level of human experts. However, the game of Dou Di Zhu presents significant challenges due to its vast state/action space and unique characteristics involving reasoning about competition and cooperation, making the game extremely difficult to solve.The RL model DouZero, trained using the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework, has shown excellent performance in DouDiZhu. However, there are differences between its simplified game environment and the actual Dou Di Zhu environment, and its performance is still a considerable distance from that of human experts. This paper modifies the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework by using reinforcement learning to obtain a neural network that simultaneously estimates win rates and expectations. The action space is pruned using expectations, and strategies are generated based on win rates. This RL model is trained in a realistic DouDiZhu environment and achieves a state-of-the-art level among publicly available models.</description>

      <title>Online Matroid Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of an online matroid embedding, which is an algorithm for mapping an unknown matroid that is revealed in an online fashion to a larger-but-known matroid. The existence of such embedding enables a reduction from the version of the matroid secretary problem where the matroid is unknown to the version where the matroid is known in advance. We show that online matroid embeddings exist for binary (and hence graphic) and laminar matroids. We also show a negative result showing that no online matroid embedding exists for the class of all matroids. Finally, we define the notion of an approximate matroid embedding, generalizing the notion of {\alpha}-partition property, and provide an upper bound on the approximability of binary matroids by a partition matroid, matching the lower bound of Dughmi et al.</description>

      <title>The Average-Value Allocation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of centralized algorithms for welfare-maximizing allocation of goods to buyers subject to average-value constraints. We show that this problem is NP-hard to approximate beyond a factor of $\frac{e}{e-1}$, and provide a $\frac{4e}{e-1}$-approximate offline algorithm. For the online setting, we show that no non-trivial approximations are achievable under adversarial arrivals. Under i.i.d. arrivals, we present a polytime online algorithm that provides a constant approximation of the optimal (computationally-unbounded) online algorithm. In contrast, we show that no constant approximation of the ex-post optimum is achievable by an online algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability: Applications to prophet inequalities &amp; transaction fee mechanism design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fundamental limits of availability and throughput for independent and heterogeneous demands of a limited resource. Availability is the probability that the demands are below the capacity of the resource. Throughput is the expected fraction of the resource that is utilized by the demands. We offer a concentration inequality generator that gives lower bounds on feasible availability and throughput pairs with a given capacity and independent but not necessarily identical distributions of up-to-unit demands. We show that availability and throughput cannot both be poor. These bounds are analogous to tail inequalities on sums of independent random variables, but hold throughout the support of the demand distribution. This analysis gives analytically tractable bounds supporting the unit-demand characterization of Chawla, Devanur, and Lykouris (2023) and generalizes to up-to-unit demands. Our bounds also provide an approach towards improved multi-unit prophet inequalities (Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, and Sandholm, 2007). They have applications to transaction fee mechanism design (for blockchains) where high availability limits the probability of profitable user-miner coalitions (Chung and Shi, 2023).</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for LLM Fine-tuning with Multiple Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) through the aggregation of multiple preferences has attracted considerable attention. However, the existing literature predominantly focuses on the empirical performance of aggregation algorithms, while neglecting the underlying motivation for agents to misreport their preferences. In this paper, we formalize this as a multi-parameter mechanism design problem, where an LLM provider designs both training and payment rules to achieve specific objectives and promote the truthful reporting of preferences. Firstly, we claim the necessity of a payment scheme by demonstrating that without payments, truth-telling is a strictly dominated strategy under a wide range of training rules. Then, we introduce the affine maximizer payment scheme for the social welfare maximizing training rules that are widely used in practice, which ensures both dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR). Furthermore, we prove that under mild conditions, any other payment rule that also implements these training rules in DSIC can be converted to the affine maximizer payment by adding a factor irrelevant to the agents' own reports. We also show that this mechanism satisfies approximate DSIC when the input of the mechanism is a biased version of the reported preferences, showcasing its robustness in real-world applications.</description>
