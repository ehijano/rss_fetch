      <title>Clustering with Potential Multidimensionality: Inference and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how clustering standard errors in one or more dimensions can be justified in M-estimation when there is sampling or assignment uncertainty. Since existing procedures for variance estimation are either conservative or invalid, we propose a variance estimator that refines a conservative procedure and remains valid. We then interpret environments where clustering is frequently employed in empirical work from our design-based perspective and provide insights on their estimands and inference procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analyst observes the frequency with which a decision maker (DM) takes actions, but does not observe the frequency of actions conditional on the payoff-relevant state. We ask when can the analyst rationalize the DM's choices as if the DM first learns something about the state before taking action. We provide a support function characterization of the triples of utility functions, prior beliefs, and (marginal) distributions over actions such that the DM's action distribution is consistent with information given the agent's prior and utility function. Assumptions on the cardinality of the state space and the utility function allow us to refine this characterization, obtaining a sharp system of finitely many inequalities the utility function, prior, and action distribution must satisfy. We apply our characterization to study comparative statics and ring-network games, and to identify conditions under which a data set is consistent with a public information structure in first-order Bayesian persuasion games. We characterize the set of distributions over posterior beliefs that are consistent with the DM's choices. Assuming the first-order approach applies, we extend our results to settings with a continuum of actions and/or states.%</description>

      <title>Adjustment with Many Regressors Under Covariate-Adaptive Randomizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper discovers a new trade-off of using regression adjustments (RAs) in causal inference under covariate-adaptive randomizations (CARs). On one hand, RAs can improve the efficiency of causal estimators by incorporating information from covariates that are not used in the randomization. On the other hand, RAs can degrade estimation efficiency due to their estimation errors, which are not asymptotically negligible when the number of regressors is of the same order as the sample size. Ignoring the estimation errors of RAs may result in serious over-rejection of causal inference under the null hypothesis. To address the issue, we construct a new ATE estimator by optimally linearly combining the estimators with and without RAs. We then develop a unified inference theory for this estimator under CARs. It has two features: (1) the Wald test based on it achieves the exact asymptotic size under the null hypothesis, regardless of whether the number of covariates is fixed or diverges no faster than the sample size; and (2) it guarantees weak efficiency improvement over estimators both with and without RAs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility in Mean: Efficient Analysis by a Generalized Mixture Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the simulation-based Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models. Extending the highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixture sampler for the SV model proposed in Kim et al. (1998) and Omori et al. (2007), we develop an accurate approximation of the non-central chi-squared distribution as a mixture of thirty normal distributions. Under this mixture representation, we sample the parameters and latent volatilities in one block. We also detail a correction of the small approximation error by using additional Metropolis-Hastings steps. The proposed method is extended to the SVM model with leverage. The methodology and models are applied to excess holding yields and S&amp;P500 returns in empirical studies, and the SVM models are shown to outperform other volatility models based on marginal likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Two-way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences Estimators in Heterogeneous Adoption Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation under a parallel trends assumption, in designs where no unit is treated at period one, all units receive a strictly positive dose at period two, and the dose varies across units. There are therefore no true control groups in such cases. First, we develop a test of the assumption that the treatment effect is mean independent of the treatment, under which the commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects estimator is consistent. When this test is rejected or lacks power, we propose alternative estimators, robust to heterogeneous effects. If there are units with a period-two treatment arbitrarily close to zero, the robust estimator is a difference-in-difference using units with a period-two treatment below a bandwidth as controls. Without such units, we propose non-parametric bounds, and an estimator relying on a parametric specification of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We use our results to revisit Pierce and Schott (2016) and Enikolopov et al. (2011).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Dynamic Factor Models for High-dimensional Matrix-valued Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional matrix-valued time series are of significant interest in economics and finance, with prominent examples including cross region macroeconomic panels and firms' financial data panels. We introduce a class of Bayesian matrix dynamic factor models that utilize matrix structures to identify more interpretable factor patterns and factor impacts. Our model accommodates time-varying volatility, adjusts for outliers, and allows cross-sectional correlations in the idiosyncratic components. To determine the dimension of the factor matrix, we employ an importance-sampling estimator based on the cross-entropy method to estimate marginal likelihoods. Through a series of Monte Carlo experiments, we show the properties of the factor estimators and the performance of the marginal likelihood estimator in correctly identifying the true dimensions of the factor matrices. Applying our model to a macroeconomic dataset and a financial dataset, we demonstrate its ability in unveiling interesting features within matrix-valued time series.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public policies and medical interventions often involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where individuals receive a series of interventions over multiple stages. We study the statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's evolving history. We propose a doubly robust, classification-based approach to learning the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. This approach learns the optimal DTR through backward induction. At each step, it constructs an augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the policy value function and maximizes it to learn the optimal policy for the corresponding stage. We show that the resulting DTR can achieve an optimal convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for welfare regret under mild convergence conditions on estimators of the nuisance components.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of bootstrap for matching estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a landmark paper, Abadie and Imbens (2008) showed that the naive bootstrap is inconsistent when applied to nearest neighbor matching estimators of the average treatment effect with a fixed number of matches. Since then, this finding has inspired numerous efforts to address the inconsistency issue, typically by employing alternative bootstrap methods. In contrast, this paper shows that the naive bootstrap is provably consistent for the original matching estimator, provided that the number of matches, $M$, diverges. The bootstrap inconsistency identified by Abadie and Imbens (2008) thus arises solely from the use of a fixed $M$.</description>
