      <title>Convergence Rates for Learning Pseudo-Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes convergence rates for learning elliptic pseudo-differential operators, a fundamental operator class in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Inference for concave distribution functions under measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an estimator of a concave cumulative distribution function under the measurement error model, where the non-negative variables of interest are perturbed by additive independent random noise. The estimator is defined as the least concave majorant on the positive half-line of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function. We show its uniform consistency and its square root convergence in law in $\ell_\infty(\mathbb R)$. To assess the validity of the concavity assumption, we construct a test for the nonparametric null hypothesis that the distribution function is concave on the positive half-line, against the alternative that it is not. We calibrate the test using bootstrap methods. The theoretical justification for calibration led us to establish a bootstrap version of Theorem 1 in S\"ohl and Trabs (2012), a Donsker-type result from which we obtain, as a special case, the limiting behavior of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function in a bootstrap setting with measurement error. Combining this Donsker-type theorem with the functional delta method, we show that the test statistic and its bootstrap version have the same limiting distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas under the alternative, the bootstrap statistic is stochastically smaller. Consequently, the power of the test tends to one, for any fixed alternative, as the sample size tends to infinity. In addition to the theoretical results for the estimator and the test, we investigate their finite-sample performance in simulation studies.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of testable hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a fundamental question in hypothesis testing: given two sets of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, when does a nontrivial (i.e.\ strictly unbiased) test for $\mathcal{P}$ against $\mathcal{Q}$ exist? Le~Cam showed that, when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ have a common dominating measure, a test that has power exceeding its level by more than $\varepsilon$ exists if and only if the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are separated in total variation distance by more than $\varepsilon$. The requirement of a dominating measure is frequently violated in nonparametric statistics. In a passing remark, Le~Cam described an approach to address more general scenarios, but he stopped short of stating a formal theorem. This work completes Le~Cam's program, by presenting a matching necessary and sufficient condition for testability: for the aforementioned theorem to hold without assumptions, one must take the closures of the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ in the space of bounded finitely additive measures. We provide simple elucidating examples, and elaborate on various subtle measure theoretic and topological points regarding compactness and achievability.</description>

      <title>Learning Multinomial Logits in $O(n \log n)$ time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is composed of a finite universe of items $[n]=\{1,..., n\}$, each assigned a positive weight. A query specifies an admissible subset -- called a slate -- and the model chooses one item from that slate with probability proportional to its weight. This query model is also known as the Plackett-Luce model or conditional sampling oracle in the literature. Although MNLs have been studied extensively, a basic computational question remains open: given query access to slates, how efficiently can we learn weights so that, for every slate, the induced choice distribution is within total variation distance $\varepsilon$ of the ground truth? This question is central to MNL learning and has direct implications for modern recommender system interfaces.
  We provide two algorithms for this task, one with adaptive queries and one with non-adaptive queries. Each algorithm outputs an MNL $M'$ that induces, for each slate $S$, a distribution $M'_S$ on $S$ that is within $\varepsilon$ total variation distance of the true distribution. Our adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n\right)$ queries, while our non-adaptive algorithm makes $O\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{3}}\log n \log\frac{n}{\varepsilon}\right)$ queries. Both algorithms query only slates of size two and run in time proportional to their query complexity.
  We complement these upper bounds with lower bounds of $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for adaptive queries and $\Omega\left(\frac{n^{2}}{\varepsilon^{2}}\log n\right)$ for non-adaptive queries, thus proving that our adaptive algorithm is optimal in its dependence on the support size $n$, while the non-adaptive one is tight within a $\log n$ factor.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Adaptive Joint Learning Framework for High-Dimensional Time-Varying Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern biomedical and econometric studies, longitudinal processes are often characterized by complex time-varying associations and abrupt regime shifts that are shared across correlated outcomes. Standard functional data analysis (FDA) methods, which prioritize smoothness, often fail to capture these dynamic structural features, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This article introduces Adaptive Joint Learning (AJL), a regularization framework designed to simultaneously perform functional variable selection and structural changepoint detection in multivariate time-varying coefficient models. We propose a convex optimization procedure that synergizes adaptive group-wise penalization with fused regularization, effectively borrowing strength across multiple outcomes to enhance estimation efficiency. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the estimator in the ultra-high-dimensional regime (p &gt;&gt; n), establishing non-asymptotic error bounds and proving that AJL achieves the oracle property--performing as well as if the true active set and changepoint locations were known a priori. A key theoretical contribution is the explicit handling of approximation bias via undersmoothing conditions to ensure valid asymptotic inference. The proposed method is validated through comprehensive simulations and an application to Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) data. The analysis uncovers synchronized phase transitions in disease progression and identifies a parsimonious set of time-varying prognostic markers.</description>

      <title>Distributional Limits for Eigenvalues of Graphon Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of individual eigenvalues of kernel matrices arising from dense graphon-based random graphs. Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. We show that a sharp dichotomy governs the asymptotic behavior. In the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime, the leading fluctuations vanish and the centered eigenvalue converges to an explicit weighted chi-square limit determined by the operator spectrum. Our analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz-type assumptions on the graphon. While earlier work under comparable integrability conditions established operator convergence and eigenspace consistency, the present results characterize the full fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues, thereby extending eigenvalue fluctuation theory beyond regimes accessible through operator convergence alone.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Deep Learning: A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling Uncertainty in Structured Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an It\^o SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-time modeling of uncertainty while preserving a principled mathematical foundation. The drift and diffusion terms of the SDE are parameterized by neural networks, enabling data-driven inference and generalizing classical time series models to handle irregular sampling and complex dynamic structure.
  A central theoretical contribution is the co-parameterization of the adjoint state with a dedicated neural network, forming a coupled forward-backward system that captures not only latent evolution but also gradient dynamics. I introduce a pathwise-regularized adjoint loss and analyze variance-reduced gradient flows through the lens of stochastic calculus, offering new tools for improving training stability in deep latent SDEs. My paper unifies and extends variational inference, continuous-time generative modeling, and control-theoretic optimization, providing a rigorous foundation for future developments in stochastic probabilistic machine learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2025) up to logarithmic factors and exceeds the $O(T^{2/3-\varepsilon})$ upper bound for marginal calibration (Dagan et al., 2025), thereby separating the two problems.
  We then turn to lower bounds for the more difficult case of group functions that may depend on context but not on the learner's predictions. In this case, we establish an $\widetilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ lower bound for online multicalibration via a $\Theta(T)$-sized group family constructed using orthogonal function systems, again matching upper bounds up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a widely used stratified sampling method in computer experiments. In this work, we extend the existing convergence results for the sample mean under LHS to the broader class of $Z$-estimators, estimators defined as the zeros of a sample mean function. We derive the asymptotic variance of these estimators and demonstrate that it is smaller when using LHS compared to traditional independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling. Furthermore, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for $Z$-estimators under LHS, providing a theoretical foundation for its improved efficiency.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Model with unknown diagonal covariances via continuous sparse regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the statistical estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with unknown diagonal covariances from independent and identically distributed samples. We employ the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO), a convex optimization framework that promotes sparsity in the space of measures, to simultaneously estimate the number of components and their parameters. Our main contribution extends the BLASSO methodology to multivariate GMMs with component-specific unknown diagonal covariance matrices. This setting is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, which required known and identical covariances. We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees with nearly parametric convergence rates for component means, diagonal covariances, and weights, as well as for density prediction. A key theoretical contribution is the identification of an explicit separation condition on mixture components that enables the construction of non-degenerate dual certificates-essential tools for establishing statistical guarantees for the BLASSO. Our analysis leverages the Fisher-Rao geometry of the statistical model and introduces a novel semi-distance adapted to our framework, providing new insights into the interplay between component separation, parameter space geometry, and achievable statistical recovery.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Cross-Validation Error: Stability, Covariance, and Minimax Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite ongoing theoretical research on cross-validation (CV), many theoretical questions remain widely open. This motivates our investigation into how properties of algorithm-distribution pairs can affect the choice for the number of folds in $k$-fold CV.
  Our results consist of a novel decomposition of the mean-squared error of cross-validation for risk estimation, which explicitly captures the correlations of error estimates across overlapping folds and includes a novel algorithmic stability notion, squared loss stability, that is considerably weaker than the typically required hypothesis stability in other comparable works.
  Furthermore, we prove:
  1. For any learning algorithm that minimizes empirical risk, the mean-squared error of the $k$-fold cross-validation estimator $\widehat{L}_{\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)}$ of the population risk $L_{D}$ satisfies the following minimax lower bound: \[ \min_{k \mid n} \max_{D} \mathbb{E}\left[\big(\widehat{L}_{\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} - L_{D}\big)^{2}\right]=\Omega\big(\sqrt{k^*}/n\big), \] where $n$ is the sample size, $k$ the number of folds, and $k^*$ denotes the number of folds attaining the minimax optimum. This shows that even under idealized conditions, for large values of $k$, CV cannot attain the optimum of order $1/n$ achievable by a validation set of size $n$, reflecting an inherent penalty caused by dependence between folds.
  2. Complementing this, we exhibit learning rules for which \[ \max_{D}\mathbb{E}\!\left[\big(\widehat{L}_{\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} - L_{D}\big)^{2}\right]=\Omega(k/n), \] matching (up to constants) the accuracy of a hold-out estimator of a single fold of size $n/k$.
  Together these results delineate the fundamental trade-off in resampling-based risk estimation: CV cannot fully exploit all $n$ samples for unbiased risk evaluation, and its minimax performance is pinned between the $k/n$ and $\sqrt{k}/n$ regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two main contributions to the expected star discrepancy theory. First, we derive a sharper expected upper bound for jittered sampling, improving the leading constants and logarithmic terms compared to the state-of-the-art [Doerr, 2022]. Second, we prove the strong partition principle for star discrepancy, showing that any equal-measure stratified sampling yields a strictly smaller expected discrepancy than simple random sampling, thereby resolving an open question in [Kiderlen and Pausinger, 2022]. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical advances and illustrate the superiority of stratified sampling in low to moderate dimensions.</description>

      <title>Minimum Variance Designs With Constrained Maximum Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designs which are minimax in the presence of model misspecifications have been constructed so as to minimize the maximum, over classes of alternate response models, of the integrated mean squared error of the predicted values. This mean squared error decomposes into a term arising solely from variation, and a bias term arising from the model errors. Here we consider of designing so as to minimize the variance of the predictors, subject to a bound on the maximum (over model misspecifications) bias. We consider as well designing so as to minimize the maximum bias, subject to a bound on the variance. We show that solutions to both problems are given by the minimax designs, with appropriately chosen values of their tuning constants. Conversely, any minimax design solves each problem for an appropriate choice of the bound on the maximum bias or variance.</description>

      <title>Sharp Non-Asymptotic Bounds for the Star Discrepancy of Double-Infinite Random Matrices via Optimal Covering Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sharp non-asymptotic probabilistic bounds for the star discrepancy of double-infinite random matrices -- a canonical model for sequences of random point sets in high dimensions. By integrating the recently proved \textbf{optimal covering numbers for axis-parallel boxes} (Gnewuch, 2024) into the dyadic chaining framework, we achieve \textbf{explicitly computable constants} that improve upon all previously known bounds.
  For dimension $d \ge 3$, we prove that with high probability, \[ D_N^d \le \sqrt{\alpha A_d + \beta B \frac{\ln \log_2 N}{d}} \sqrt{\frac{d}{N}}, \] where $A_d$ is given by an explicit series and satisfies $A_3 \le 745$, a \textbf{14\% improvement} over the previous best constant of 868 (Fiedler et al., 2023). For $d=2$, we obtain the currently smallest known constant $A_2 \le 915$.
  Our analysis reveals a \textbf{precise trade-off} between the dimensional dependence and the logarithmic factor in $N$, highlighting how optimal covering estimates directly translate to tighter discrepancy bounds. These results immediately yield improved error guarantees for \textbf{quasi-Monte Carlo integration, uncertainty quantification, and high-dimensional sampling}, and provide a new benchmark for the probabilistic analysis of geometric discrepancy.

      <title>Explainable Binary Classification of Separable Shape Ensembles</title>

Abstract: Scientists, engineers, biologists, and technology specialists universally leverage image segmentation to extract shape ensembles containing many thousands of curves representing patterns in observations and measurements. These large curve ensembles facilitate inferences about important changes when comparing and contrasting images. We introduce novel pattern recognition formalisms combined with inference methods over large ensembles of segmented curves. Our formalism involves accurately approximating eigenspaces of composite integral operators to motivate discrete, dual representations of curves collocated at quadrature nodes. Approximations are projected onto underlying matrix manifolds and the resulting separable shape tensors constitute rigid-invariant decompositions of curves into generalized (linear) scale variations and complementary (nonlinear) undulations. With thousands of curves segmented from pairs of images, we demonstrate how data-driven features of separable shape tensors inform explainable binary classification utilizing a product maximum mean discrepancy; absent labeled data, building interpretable feature spaces in seconds without high performance computation, and detecting discrepancies below cursory visual inspections.</description>

      <title>Breaking AR's Sampling Bottleneck: Provable Acceleration via Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models allow for parallel sampling, offering a promising path to accelerate generation and eliminate the left-to-right generation constraints. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understandings of diffusion language models remain underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence. Crucially, our theory covers the regime $T&lt;L$, where $L$ is the text sequence length. This justifies that high-quality samples can be generated with fewer iterations than $L$, thereby breaking the fundamental sampling bottleneck of $L$ steps required by AR models. We further establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, that shows the tightness of our convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.</description>

      <title>Avoiding the Price of Adaptivity: Inference in Linear Contextual Bandits via Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is challenging due to the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work shows that classical least-squares inference can fail under adaptive sampling, and that valid confidence intervals for linear functionals typically require an inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often termed the price of adaptivity -- reflects the intrinsic difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies. A key structural condition that overcomes this limitation is the stability condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to converge to a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals remain asymptotically valid under adaptation, without incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a regularized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. We additionally provide quantitative rates of convergence in the associated central limit theorem. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. As an application of our theory, we show how it can be used to construct confidence intervals for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under adaptively collected data. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.</description>
