      <title>Anomalous energy correlations and spectral form factor in the nonergodic phase of the $\beta$-ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping. Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$: correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R} \equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$. We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window $t_\mathrm{R} &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system. We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to the Anderson model.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic Dissipation as a Mechanism for Steady-State Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum systems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However, recent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to facilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase transitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for inducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic potential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase correlations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter, which enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically comparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and incommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most efficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on coherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link between eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that dissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing decoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable approach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially enabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven phases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Diagram of the REM under independent spin-flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape of the Random Energy model (REM) integrated along trajectories of the simple random walk on the hypercube. We show that the quenched cumulant generating function of the time integral of the REM energy undergoes phase transitions in the large $N$ limit for trajectories of any time extent, and identify phases distinguished by the activity and value of the time integral. This is achieved by relating the dynamical behavior to the spectral properties of Hamiltonians associated with the Quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). Of independent interest are deterministic $ \ell^p $-properties of the resolvents of such Hamiltonians, which we establish.</description>

      <title>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Ground State Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains. We derive the Master equations for the distribution function of pair distances $\tilde{r}$.
  First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, keeping only interactions for adjacent spins. We confirm that it is solved by the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. Then, we solve the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins for any anisotropy ranging from the XX-limit to the isotropic Heisenberg limit, corresponding to a tight binding chain of disordered long range interacting Fermions with long range hopping. We thereby show that the distribution function of couplings $J$ at renormalization scale $\Omega$ flows to the strong disorder fixed point distribution with small corrections at $\tilde{r} &gt; \rho,$ which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility diverges with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths $l$ is found to decay as $l^{-2}$. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ increases in the ground state logarithmically for all $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. After a global quantum quench the entanglement entropy increases with time logarithmically as $S(t) \sim \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic neuron approach to deep neural networks: Decoupling neurons for renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce an approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similarly to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation-a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain. Notably, such a topological correlation function is characterized by critical exponents that appear universal across disorder types, yet they can resolve different topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving landscape of quantum algorithm software specifically tailored for condensed matter physics. It examines fundamental quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as applied to key condensed matter problems including strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum magnetism. This review details leading software development kits (SDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and Q\#, and profiles key academic, commercial, and governmental initiatives driving innovation in this domain. Furthermore, it assesses current challenges, including hardware limitations, algorithmic scalability, and error mitigation, and explores future trajectories, anticipating new algorithmic breakthroughs, software enhancements, and the impact of next-generation quantum hardware. The central theme emphasizes the critical role of a co-design approach, where algorithms, software, and hardware evolve in tandem, and highlights the necessity of standardized benchmarks to accelerate progress towards leveraging quantum computation for transformative discoveries in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.</description>
