      <title>Statistical field theory of equilibrium amorphous solids and the intrinsic heterogeneity distributions that characterize them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich variety of amorphous solids are found in nature and technology, including ones formed via the vulcanization of long, flexible molecules. A special class -- those featuring a wide gap between the long timescales over which constraints in them release and the much shorter timescales over which their unconstrained freedoms relax -- exhibit states of thermodynamic equilibrium and are thus amenable to the framework of equilibrium statistical physics. The approach reviewed here is the least specific -- and thus the most general -- approach to the statistical mechanics of equilibrium amorphous solid-formers: statistical field theory. An overview is given of the key elements and results of this theory. The field of the theory is constructed to detect and diagnose the amorphous solid state. Its form turns out to be unusual, in ways that are essential for its application, so it is examined in detail, as is the form of the field theory controlling the field. What this theory can predict for the equilibrium properties of amorphous solids is then discussed, including: the transition to the amorphous solid state and the heterogeneity of the resulting solid; the impact of fluctuations on the transition and connections with percolation theory; the pattern of symmetry-breaking and the nature of the resulting elasticity; and field correlations and the information they provide. Emphasis is placed on the idea, peculiar to amorphous solids, that their equilibrium states are naturally characterized in terms of distributions that capture the intrinsic spatial heterogeneity of the thermal motions of their constituents. The theory's field has an internal structure that subtly encodes this information, via the wave-vector dependencies of the average field and its correlations. Reflections are made on the applicability of theses ideas and results to a range of amorphous solids and related systems.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed holographic molecular binding assays with internal calibration standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic molecular binding assays detect macromolecules binding to colloidal probe beads by monitoring nanometer-scale changes in the beads' diameters with holographic microscopy. Measured changes are interpreted with Maxwell Garnett effective-medium theory to infer the surface coverage of analyte molecules and therefore to measure the analyte concentration in solution. The precision and accuracy of those measurements can be degraded by run-to-run instrumental variations, which introduce systematic errors in the holographic characterization measurements. We detect and mitigate these errors by introducing a class of inert reference beads whose polymer brush coating resists macromolecular binding. The holographically measured diameter and refractive index of those beads serve as internal standards for THC measurements. To characterize the reference beads, we introduce a general all-optical method to measure the grafting density of the polymer brush that combines holographic characterization of the bead diameter with a refractometry measurement of the polymer's specific volume. The latter technique shows the specific volume of poly(ethylene oxide) to be 1.308(4) cubic nanometers per kilodalton. We use this suite of techniques to demonstrate a multiplexed immunoassay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) whose success validates the effective-medium analysis of holographic characterization measurements. Internal negative controls provided by the reference beads are validated by negative control measurements on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which has a similar molecular weight to IgG but does not bind to the probe beads' binding sites.</description>

      <title>Density modulations in active colloidal systems through orthogonal propulsion control and sensory delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in active colloidal systems aim to mimic key characteristics of biological microswimmers, particularly their adaptive motility in response to environmental changes. While many approaches rely on externally imposing a propulsive force, achieving true autonomous and self-regulating adaptation to the environment remains limited. In this study, we develop and analyze Janus microswimmers driven by electrohydrodynamic flows that autonomously adjust their propulsion dynamics in response to varying illumination conditions. Our Janus particles are silica colloids partially coated with titania, which self-propel via induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP) under uniform AC electric fields. Since titania is photoconductive, it increases its conductivity under UV illumination, which thereby regulates the propulsion velocity independently of and orthogonally to the applied electric field. Crucially, the velocity adaptation requires a finite time. This sensory delay, which we systematically characterize, leads to enhanced microswimmer localization in response to spatiotemporal light modulations compared to the typical case of instantaneous response considered for synthetic microswimmers. By harnessing these dynamics, akin to those of biological microswimmers, we exert precise control over both local and global particle behavior, presenting novel opportunities for adaptive active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Splay Stiffening and Twist Softening in a Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematics-genuine 3D ferroelectric fluids-has underscored the importance of electrostatic interactions in shaping the physical behaviour of soft matter systems. In this paper, we investigate the mechanical properties of ferroelectric nematics by directly comparing the splay and twist elastic constants in a liquid crystal system that exhibits both nonpolar and ferroelectric nematic phases. Our results reveal that polar ordering results in increased splay rigidity and a concomitant reduction in twist elasticity.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). However, the interpretation of vesicle deformation under flow has been hindered by the absence of a suitable theoretical or computational framework. Here, we present a simulation-based model that describes GUV deformation in RT-DC, taking into account the surface dilational elastic modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area.
  Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the surface dilational modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously in resonance with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that underlies a range of phenomena previously regarded as disparate -- including in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections -- and places them within a unified mechanistic framework resulting from generic wave superposition principles.</description>
