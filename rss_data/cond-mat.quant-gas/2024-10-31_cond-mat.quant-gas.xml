      <title>Geometry Dynamics in Chiral Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric response of chiral superfluids when coupled to a dynamic background geometry. We find that geometry fluctuations, represented by the flexural mode, interact with the superfluid phase fluctuations (the Goldstone mode). Starting from a minimally coupled theory, we derive the equilibrium conditions for a static background defined by supercurrent, curvature, and tension, and then obtain linearized equations for the propagation of the Goldstone and flexural modes. The equations reveal distinctive chirality-dependent effects in the propagation of the flexural mode. Specifically, a background supercurrent induces a chiral drag effect, localizing flexural waves at the superfluid boundary, while background curvature introduces anisotropic corrections to the superfluid phase and group velocities, as well as a tension in the flexural mode dispersion. Furthermore, curvature couples flexural and phase modes into dressed excitations, with tilted Dirac cones along the principal curvature directions. These effects provide dynamical signatures of the formation of a chiral condensate, and can be tuned by manipulating the background geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical probing of high-order spin coherence in one-dimensional mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional SU(2) ultracold fermions near the Tonks-Girardeau limit, confined in a box potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium by initially preparing the two spin components in a fully separated configuration, and its evolution is described by the Hamiltonian in the presence of strong repulsive interactions. Building on the results of [Phys.Rev. A, 107, L061301 (2023)], we extend the analysis to out-of-equilibrium dynamics, uncovering the emergence of time-dependent oscillating high-momentum tails in the momentum distribution. These oscillations, due to the finite size of the system, are governed by a nonlocal, high-order spin coherence term, whose amplitude and phase evolve over time. We show that this term initially grows as time to the power N/2 and subsequently follows the spin-mixing dynamics of the system. Notably, when the spin components are fully mixed, the amplitude of this border-to-border spin coherence reaches its maximum value.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced transport of quantum vortices in joined atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>Analytical form of the density of states of a Fermi gas in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of a Fermi gas across various dimensions has already been extensively explored. However, existing formulations often lack clarity or exhibit inconsistencies. In this work, we present a streamlined approach for deriving the density of states (DOS) for a $d$-dimensional Fermi gas for semiconductors. We provide explicit general expressions for key Fermi quantities, including the wavevector, energy, temperature, momentum, wavelength, and velocity. Moreover, we apply these expressions to calculate for the carrier concentration and thermodynamic properties such as the internal energy, chemical potential, specific heat, electron degeneracy pressure, and bulk modulus. From the degeneracy pressure, we attribute a purely quantum mechanical explanation for the enhancement of carrier concentration in lower dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions. Our observations are reproduced in numerical calculations within the Hartree-Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>From explicit to spontaneous charge order and the fate of antiferromagnetic quantum Hall state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic quantum Hall insulator (AFQHI) where one of the spin components is in the quantum Hall state and the other in the trivial state is an established phase emerging as a result of the Hubbard repulsion in spinful quantum Hall systems. The stabilization of the AFQHI requires a charge order preventing the effect of the spin-flip transformation on the electronic state to be compensated by a space group operation, and is often induced via an ionic potential. While one would naively expect the nearest-neighbor (NN) density-density interaction favoring spontaneous charge order to result in qualitatively similar phenomena an analysis of the Haldane-Hubbard model extended by the NN interaction finds no AFQHI. Here, by considering an extended version of the Harper-Hofstadter-Hubbard model we go beyond the honeycomb structure and show that the realization of the AFQHI generically requires an explicit charge order and cannot be emerged through a spontaneous charge order. We unveil how the AFQHI disappears upon approaching from the explicit to the spontaneous charge ordering limit. Our findings shine more light on the stabilization conditions of the AFQHI which can guide the future optical lattice experiments searching for this intriguing magnetic topological insulator phase.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. We visualize the Bell-cat states by plotting their Wigner function and also show their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>2D magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the 33rd/35th International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP, Group33/35) held in Cotonou, Benin, July 15-19, 2024. The stability of matter is an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum statistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting almost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show that there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher values of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the former case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer quantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of explicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized Liouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels. The reported work is joint with Alireza Ataei and Dinh-Thi Nguyen and makes an earlier analysis of self-dual abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory by Jackiw and Pi, Hagen, and others, mathematically rigorous.</description>

      <title>Universality and two-body losses: lessons from the effective non-Hermitian dynamics of two particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the late-time dynamics of two particles confined in one spatial dimension and subject to two-body losses. The dynamics is exactly described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that can be analytically studied both in the continuum and on a lattice. The asymptotic decay rate and the universal power-law form of the decay of the number of particles are exactly computed in the whole parameter space of the problem. When in the initial state the two particles are far apart, the average number of particles in the setup decays with time $t$ as $t^{-1/2}$; a different power law, $t^{-3/2}$, is found when the two particles overlap in the initial state. These results are valid both in the continuum and on a lattice, but in the latter case a logarithmic correction appears.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping in a driven-dissipative Kerr resonator array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear effects in the number-conserving analogue gravity of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the unitary quantum dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensates at absolute zero, and demonstrate that an analogue gravity model in such a setting must take into account the backreaction of quasiparticle excitations onto the condensate background. This in turn requires that one expands to second order in perturbations, and takes the nonlinearity of the theory into account. It is shown that this leads to significant modifications of the standard linearized analogue gravity paradigm \`a la Unruh. In particular, to obtain a fully Lorentz-covariant equation in curved spacetime for second-order perturbations, we demonstrate that it is necessary to introduce, to leading order in powers of the formal expansion parameter $N^{-1/2}$ (where $N$ is total particle number), a quantum-fluctuation-renormalized spacetime metric which substantially differs from the Unruh metric and, to subleading order, two emergent vector fields. Both the renormalized metric and the vector fields then keep track of the backreaction of the quasiparticles onto the condensate up to the order in powers of $N^{-1/2}$ considered. Finally, we apply our formalism to an analogue-cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and establish its renormalized form due to the quantum many-body backreaction exerted by the excitation cloud.</description>
