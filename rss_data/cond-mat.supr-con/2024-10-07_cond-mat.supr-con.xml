      <title>End superconductivity and three critical temperatures in Fibonacci quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a Fibonacci chain under superconducting proximity, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left end ($T_{cL}$) and right end ($T_{cR}$), governing the superconducting condensate at the chain ends. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, characteristic of quasicrystals. Due to the geometric configuration of Fibonacci chain approximants, $T_{cL}$ and $T_{cb}$ are independent of the Fibonacci sequence number $n$, while $T_{cR}$ significantly depends on the parity of $n$. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ occurs for even $n$, reaching up to $50\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $23\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for discovering materials with higher superconducting critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Implementing Josephson Junction spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junction spectroscopy is a powerful local microwave spectroscopy technique that has promising potential as a diagnostic tool to probe the microscopic origins of noise in superconducting qubits. We present advancements toward realizing Josephson junction spectroscopy in a scanning geometry, where the Josephson junction is formed between a superconducting sample and a high capacitance superconducting STM tip. Data from planar Nb-based Josephson junction devices first demonstrate the benefits of including a high capacitance shunt across the junction, which decreases linewidth and improves performance at elevated temperatures. We show how an equivalent circuit can be implemented by utilizing a planarized STM tip with local prominences, which are fabricated via electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching, followed by coating with a superconducting layer. Differential conductance measurements on a superconducting NbN surface demonstrate the ability of these high capacitance tips to decrease both thermal noise and P(E)-broadening in comparison to typical wire tips.</description>

      <title>The phases of three-dimensional $d$-wave superconductors with two attractive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave phase of the system below critical temperature depends on the ratio of two interactions in such a way that all three of the cyclic, ferromagnetic, and real phases are realized when a weak inversion-breaking term is included.</description>

      <title>Ordering of Interstitial Iron Atoms and Local Structural Distortion Induced by Iron Polycomplex in Fe1+yTe1-xSex as Seen via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we meticulously investigated the intrinsic chemical heterogeneity of Fe1+yTe, Fe1+yTe0.8Se0.2, and Fe1+yTe0.5Se0.5. Comprehensive analysis reveals the presence of interstitial iron atoms (Feint) across all samples, pre-dominantly occupying the 2c site of the P4/nmm space group. Moreover, a superstructure phase characterized by a wave vector q = 2/5a + 1/2c, originating from the ordering of Feint, is distinctly observable in the parent compound Fe1+yTe. In this scenario, the Feint atoms interact with adjacent Fe atoms, forming iron polycomplex and leading to an evident distortion of the FeTe4 tetrahedral. Experimental results further demonstrate effective suppression of Feint concentration and ordering through appropriate Se substitution; notably, Fe1+yTe0.5Se0.5 manifests the lowest concentration of Feint atoms. Our findings additionally indicate that Se substitution is random, and nanoscale phase separation induced by Te/Se chemical heterogeneity is commonly observed within Fe1+yTe1-xSex crystals.</description>

      <title>Tunable diode effect in a superconducting tunnel junction with biharmonic drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode is a superconducting circuit element that enables non-reciprocal transport, allowing a dissipationless supercurrent to preferentially flow in a single direction. Existing methods for achieving the required symmetry breaking mostly rely on specifically-designed materials or carefully-engineered circuits composed of multiple Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate that applying a biharmonic drive to a conventional superconducting tunnel-junction induces a diode effect through harmonic mixing processes that shift the supercurrent region. We show that, in a conventional tunnel junction, unity efficiency is achievable while maintaining a large supercurrent. Moreover, the relative phase between the two driving tones determines the directionality of the diode, which can be tuned in situ.</description>

      <title>Coincidence detection probability of $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of strongly correlated electrons, one of the challenging core tasks is to develop the potential techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons. The $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique has been developed to investigate the two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons. In this article, we will focus on this technique for the correlated electrons near the Fermi energy in condensed matter. The coincidence detection probability of the two emitted electrons in the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission measurement is shown to be relevant to a two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function, which describes the dynamical two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons near the Fermi energy. As the coincidence detection probability involves an electron-electron interaction matrix element, the arbitrary momentum and/or energy transfer due to this electron-electron interaction makes the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique fail to reveal the inner-pair structures of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function. However, the center-of-mass momentum and energy of the two-body Bethe-Salpeter wave function can be distinctly resolved. Thus, the $(\gamma, 2e)$ photoemission technique can provide the center-of-mass physics of the two-body correlations of the target correlated electrons. It will be one potential technique to study the center-of-mass physics of the Cooper pairs in superconductor.</description>

      <title>$\varphi$ Josephson junction induced by altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters, e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the chemical doping of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>

      <title>Possible pairing states in the superconducting bilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine various possibilities for the pairing mechanisms in the recently discovered bilayer-nickelate superconductor within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework. Unlike earlier studies, where only a pure $d$-wave or sign-changing $s$-wave superconductivity instability was investigated, our study explores the possibilities of mixed-state superconducting instability such as the one involving both $d$- and sign-changing $s$-waves. While assuming that the superconductivity arises because of the magnetic correlations, we examine the nature of the superconducting gap function associated density of states with various possible magnetic correlation wavevectors arising out as a result of multiple pockets owing to the multiple orbitals and bilayer splitting. We also explore the effect of differences in the nature of Fermi surfaces suggested by various studies.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>
