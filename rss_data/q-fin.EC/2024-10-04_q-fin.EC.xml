      <title>Food Without Fire: Nutritional and Environmental Impacts from a Solar Stove Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population pressure is speeding the rate of deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa, increasing the cost of biomass cooking fuel, which over 80 percent of the population relies upon. Higher energy input costs for meal preparation command a larger portion of household spending which in turn induces families to focus their diet on quick cooking staples. We use a field experiment in Zambia to investigate the impact of solar cook stoves on meal preparation choices and expenditures on biomass fuel. Participants kept a detailed food diary recording every ingredient and fuel source used in preparing every dish at every meal for every day during the six weeks of the experiment. This produces a data set of 93,606 ingredients used in the preparation of 30,314 dishes. While treated households used the solar stoves to prepare around 40 percent of their dishes, the solar stove treatment did not significantly increase measures of nutritional diversity nor did treated households increase the number of dishes per meal or reduce the number of meals they skipped. However, treated households significantly reduced the amount of time and money spent on obtaining fuel for cooking. These results suggest that solar stoves, while not changing a household's dietary composition, does relax cooking fuel constraints, allowing households to prepare more meals by reducing the share of household expenditure that goes to meal preparation.</description>

      <title>Populist Constitutional Backsliding and Judicial Independence: Evidence from Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic control method has emerged as a widely utilized empirical tool for estimating the causal effects of public policies, natural disasters, and other interventions on various economic, social, institutional, and political outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate the potential application of this method in empirical comparative law by estimating the impact of the 2010 constitutional referendum in Turkiye on the trajectory of judicial independence. By comparing Turkiye with a salient Mediterranean donor pool of countries that did not experience similar interventions during the period from 1987 to 2021, we provide evidence of a severe breakdown and erosion of judicial independence. This deterioration appears to be a direct response to the populist constitutional backsliding initiated by the government-orchestrated assault on the judiciary, which was carried out under the guise of judicial modernization in 2010, before the additional constitutional reforms in 2017.</description>

      <title>The Mortgage Cash-Flow Channel: How Rising Interest Rates Impact Household Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of increased debt servicing costs on household consumption resulting from monetary policy tightening. It utilizes observational panel microdata on all mortgage holders in Israel and leverages quasi-exogenous variation in exposure to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) due to a regulatory shift. Our analysis indicates that when monetary policy became more restrictive, consumers with a higher ratio of ARMs experienced a more marked reduction in their consumption patterns. This effect is predominantly observed in mid- to lower-income households and those with a higher ratio of mortgage payments to total spending. These findings highlight the substantial role of the mortgage cash-flow channel in monetary policy transmission, emphasizing its implications for economic stability and inequality.</description>

      <title>Auction-Based Regulation for Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of "moving fast and breaking things", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal pieces left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. Since AI models, such as large language models, are able to push misinformation and stoke division within our society, it is imperative for regulators to employ a framework that mitigates these dangers and ensures user safety. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI safety is lacking. We take on this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes model-building agents (i) to deploy safer models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We provably guarantee, via derived Nash Equilibria, that each participating agent's best strategy is to submit a model safer than a prescribed minimum-safety threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts safety and participation rates by 20% and 15% respectively, outperforming simple regulatory frameworks that merely enforce minimum safety standards.</description>

      <title>Risk Alignment in Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AIs $-$ AIs that are capable and permitted to undertake complex actions with little supervision $-$ mark a new frontier in AI capabilities and raise new questions about how to safely create and align such systems with users, developers, and society. Because agents' actions are influenced by their attitudes toward risk, one key aspect of alignment concerns the risk profiles of agentic AIs. Risk alignment will matter for user satisfaction and trust, but it will also have important ramifications for society more broadly, especially as agentic AIs become more autonomous and are allowed to control key aspects of our lives. AIs with reckless attitudes toward risk (either because they are calibrated to reckless human users or are poorly designed) may pose significant threats. They might also open 'responsibility gaps' in which there is no agent who can be held accountable for harmful actions. What risk attitudes should guide an agentic AI's decision-making? How might we design AI systems that are calibrated to the risk attitudes of their users? What guardrails, if any, should be placed on the range of permissible risk attitudes? What are the ethical considerations involved when designing systems that make risky decisions on behalf of others? We present three papers that bear on key normative and technical aspects of these questions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative AI on Collaborative Open-Source Software Development: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened the possibility of automated content production, including coding in software development, which can significantly influence the participation and performance of software developers. To explore this impact, we investigate the role of GitHub Copilot, a generative AI pair programmer, on software development in open-source community, where multiple developers voluntarily collaborate on software projects. Using GitHub's dataset for open-source repositories and a generalized synthetic control method, we find that Copilot significantly enhances project-level productivity by 6.5%. Delving deeper, we dissect the key mechanisms driving this improvement. Our findings reveal a 5.5% increase in individual productivity and a 5.4% increase in participation. However, this is accompanied with a 41.6% increase in integration time, potentially due to higher coordination costs. Interestingly, we also observe the differential effects among developers. We discover that core developers achieve greater project-level productivity gains from using Copilot, benefiting more in terms of individual productivity and participation compared to peripheral developers, plausibly due to their deeper familiarity with software projects. We also find that the increase in project-level productivity is accompanied with no change in code quality. We conclude that AI pair programmers bring benefits to developers to automate and augment their code, but human developers' knowledge of software projects can enhance the benefits. In summary, our research underscores the role of AI pair programmers in impacting project-level productivity within the open-source community and suggests potential implications for the structure of open-source software projects.</description>

      <title>Modeling Migration-Induced Unemployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immigration is often blamed for increasing unemployment among local workers. However, standard models, such as the neoclassical model and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model, inherently assume that immigrants are absorbed into the labor market without affecting local unemployment. This paper presents a more general model of migration that allows for the possibility that not only the wages but also the unemployment rate of local workers may be affected by the arrival of newcomers. This extension is essential to capture the full range of potential impacts of labor migration on labor markets. The model blends a matching framework with job rationing. In it, the arrival of new workers can raise the unemployment rate among local workers, particularly in a depressed labor market where job opportunities are limited. On the positive side, in-migration helps firms fill vacancies more easily, boosting their profits. The overall impact of in-migration on local welfare varies with labor market conditions: in-migration reduces welfare when the labor market is inefficiently slack, but it enhances welfare when the labor market is inefficiently tight.</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions between Large Language Models-based Agents in Beauty Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) presents potential for deeper understanding of human behaviours within game theory frameworks. Addressing research gap on multi-player competitive games, this paper examines the strategic interactions among multiple types of LLM-based agents in a classical beauty contest game. LLM-based agents demonstrate varying depth of reasoning that fall within a range of level-0 to 1, which are lower than experimental results conducted with human subjects, but they do display similar convergence pattern towards Nash Equilibrium (NE) choice in repeated setting. Further, through variation in group composition of agent types, I found environment with lower strategic uncertainty enhances convergence for LLM-based agents, and having a mixed environment comprises of LLM-based agents of differing strategic levels accelerates convergence for all. Higher average payoffs for the more intelligent agents are usually observed, albeit at the expense of less intelligent agents. The results from game play with simulated agents not only convey insights on potential human behaviours under specified experimental set-ups, they also offer valuable understanding of strategic interactions among algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identification of fiscal SVAR-IVs in small open economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify fiscal SVAR-IVs by utilizing unexpected variation in the output of trading partner economies, measured by professional forecast errors, to account for the systematic component of fiscal policy. Our identification builds on the small open economy assumption that these forecast errors correlate with output but are exogenous to domestic fiscal policy. In applying our approach to Canada and euro area small open economies we show that the instrument is relevant and find suggestive evidence for its exogeneity. Our baseline estimates for the two-year cumulative spending multiplier are around 1 for Canada and 0.5 for euro area small open economies.</description>
