      <title>Role of correlations in the maximum distribution of multiscale stationary Markovian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in investigating the statistical properties of extreme values for strongly correlated variables. The starting motivation is to understand how the strong-correlation properties of power-law distributed processes affect the possibility of exploring the whole domain of a stochastic process (the real axis in most cases) when performing time-average numerical simulations and how this relates to the numerical evaluation of the autocorrelation function.
  We show that correlations decrease the heterogeneity of the maximum values. Specifically, through numerical simulations we observe that for strongly correlated variables whose probability distribution function decays like a power-law $1/x^\alpha$, the maximum distribution has a tail compatible with a $1/x^{\alpha+2}$ decay, while for i.i.d. variables we expect a $1/x^\alpha$ decay. As a consequence, we also show that the numerically estimated autocorrelation function converges to the theoretical prediction according to a factor that depends on the length of the simulated time-series $n$ according to a power-law: $1/n^{\alpha^\delta}$ with $\delta&lt;1$, This accounts for a very slow convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Geant4: a Game Changer in High Energy Physics and Related Applicative Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geant4 is an object-oriented toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. Its development was initially motivated by the requirements of physics experiments at high energy hadron colliders under construction in the last decade of the 20th century. Since its release in 1998, it has been exploited in many different applicative fields, including space science, nuclear physics, medical physics and archaeology. Its valuable support to scientific discovery is demonstrated by more than 16000 citations received in the past 25 years, including notable citations for main discoveries in different fields. This accomplishment shows that well designed software plays a key role in enabling scientific advancement. In this paper we discuss the key principles and the innovative decisions at the basis of Geant4, which made it a game changer in high energy physics and related fields, and outline some considerations regarding future directions.</description>

      <title>How big is Big Data?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big data has ushered in a new wave of predictive power using machine learning models. In this work, we assess what {\it big} means in the context of typical materials-science machine-learning problems. This concerns not only data volume, but also data quality and veracity as much as infrastructure issues. With selected examples, we ask (i) how models generalize to similar datasets, (ii) how high-quality datasets can be gathered from heterogenous sources, (iii) how the feature set and complexity of a model can affect expressivity, and (iv) what infrastructure requirements are needed to create larger datasets and train models on them. In sum, we find that big data present unique challenges along very different aspects that should serve to motivate further work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal synthesis of material distributions in obstacles for maximal extinction, scattering, or absorption. The material synthesis is based on an explicit construction utilizing the current distribution derived from physical bounds excited from the far-field. The bounds are expressed in radiation modes for materials restricted by their resistivity and characteristic modes for materials restricted by the contrast. The results are valid for arbitrary shapes, and analytical expressions are provided for spherical shapes.</description>

      <title>CTGNN: Crystal Transformer Graph Neural Network for Crystal Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of deep learning algorithm and materials science has made significant progress in predicting novel materials and understanding various behaviours of materials. Here, we introduced a new model called as the Crystal Transformer Graph Neural Network (CTGNN), which combines the advantages of Transformer model and graph neural networks to address the complexity of structure-properties relation of material data. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, CTGNN incorporates the graph network structure for capturing local atomic interactions and the dual-Transformer structures to model intra-crystal and inter-atomic relationships comprehensively. The benchmark carried on by the proposed CTGNN indicates that CTGNN significantly outperforms existing models like CGCNN and MEGNET in the prediction of formation energy and bandgap properties. Our work highlights the potential of CTGNN to enhance the performance of properties prediction and accelerates the discovery of new materials, particularly for perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Towards realistic magneto-optical matter: Modeling dynamics of magneto-optical dimers with arbitrary collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical matter, a rapidly growing field, aims to develop novel methods for controlling and assembling mesoscale systems through fascinating light-matter interactions. Its traditional approaches often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups. These methods require strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. This work introduces an alternative approach using magneto-optical particles and straightforward illumination to effectively create magneto-optical matter. Our numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. To illustrate the capabilities of the developed method, we examine the impact of thermal noise, collision types, geometric variations, and resonance excitation on a dimer system, generating multiple scenarios for favorable dimer formation and subsequent manipulation. It is found that anisotropic dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. We believe our method and subsequent findings provide essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of electromagnetically interacting components.</description>

Abstract: The projection method is the standard approach for numerically integrating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation initial-boundary-value problem. Typical boundary conditions specify either the velocity or the gradient velocity on the boundary.

      <title>Unraveling the Spin Coulomb Drag Effect and Its Impact on Spin Transport in the Three-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems. This effect leads to the emergence of a spin mass and the finite lifetime of spin currents, posing challenges for the accurate description of spin dynamics. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we investigate the spin-resolved exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the three-dimensional uniform electron gas. Our analysis reveals a distinct nature in the spin response, characterized by a $1/q^2$ divergence in the spin XC kernel at finite frequencies. This so-called ultranonlocal behavior, stemming from the spin Coulomb drag effect, is absent in the charge channel. By extracting precise values for the spin mass enhancement factor, we observe a trend of increasing enhancement with decreasing electron density. Furthermore, we find compelling evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures, characterized by vanishing inverse relaxation times. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate relation between the Coulomb interaction and the spin transport, providing valuable insights for the development of accurate density functional approximations and the advancement of spintronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of two spinodal decomposition criteria with a case study of Fe${}_{15}$Co${}_{15}$Ni${}_{35}$Cu${}_{35}$ multicomponent alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys has attracted increasing attention due to its beneficial effect on their mechanical and functional properties and potential applications. Both based on the Cahn-Hillard equation, the reference element method (REM) and the projection matrix method (PMM) are the two main methods to predict the occurrence of spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys. In this work, it is mathematically proven that the two methods are equivalent, and therefore the advanced results based on one method can be applied to the other. Based on these methods, the $Fe{}_{15}$Co${}_{15}$Ni${}_{35}$Cu${}_{35}$ multicomponent alloy is designed as a case study. Experimental results confirm the spinodal decomposition in the heat-treated alloy, and its strength and ductility are simultaneously enhanced. This work can be the pavement for further theoretical and experimental studies on the spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Shallow Recurrent Decoder for Reduced Order Modeling of Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced order models are becoming increasingly important for rendering complex and multiscale spatio-temporal dynamics computationally tractable. The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.</description>

      <title>QuanEstimation.jl: An open-source Julia framework for quantum parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source tensor network Python library for quantum many-body simulations. At its core is an abelian-symmetric tensor, implemented as a sparse block structure managed by logical layer on top of dense multi-dimensional array backend. This serves as the basis for higher-level tensor networks algorithms, operating on matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, implemented here. Using appropriate backend, such as PyTorch, gives direct access to automatic differentiation (AD) for cost-function gradient calculations and execution on GPUs or other supported accelerators. We show the library performance in simulations with infinite projected entangled-pair states, such as finding the ground states with AD, or simulating thermal states of the Hubbard model via imaginary time evolution. We quantify sources of performance gains in those challenging examples allowed by utilizing symmetries.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Computation of Morphological Complexity in the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reductions of the self-consistent mean field theory model of amphiphilic molecules in solvent can lead to a singular family of functionalized Cahn-Hilliard energies. We modify these energies, mollifying the singularities to stabilize the computation of the gradient flows and develop a series of benchmark problems that emulate the "morphological complexity" observed in experiments. These benchmarks investigate the delicate balance between the rate of absorption of amphiphilic material onto an interface and a least energy mechanism to disperse the arriving mass. The result is a trichotomy of responses in which two-dimensional interfaces either lengthen by a regularized motion against curvature, undergo pearling bifurcations, or split directly into networks of interfaces. We evaluate a number of schemes that use second order BDF2-type time stepping coupled with Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization. The BDF2-type schemes are either based on a fully implicit time discretization with a PSD nonlinear solver, or upon IMEX, SAV, ETD approaches. All schemes use a fixed local truncation error target with adaptive time-stepping to achieve the error target. Each scheme requires proper "preconditioning" to achieve robust performance that can enhance efficiency by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many areas of science and engineering encounter data defined on spherical manifolds. Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms. Provided access to sufficiently many GPUs our transforms thus exhibit an unprecedented effective linear time complexity.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

Abstract: We study the electronic excitation spectra in solid molecular hydrogen (phase I) at ambient temperature and 5-90 GPa pressures using Quantum Monte Carlo methods and Many-Body Perturbation Theory. In this range, the system changes from a wide gap molecular insulator to a semiconductor, altering the nature of the excitations from localized to delocalized. Computed gaps and spectra agree with experiments, proving the ability to predict accurately band gaps of many-body systems in presence of nuclear quantum and thermal effects.</description>

Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

      <title>Control of the damage threshold of Si via a SiO2 coating upon irradiation with Mid-IR femtosecond laser pulses</title>

Abstract: A key issue in the use of high-power mid-infrared (Mid-IR) laser sources for a plethora of applications is the investigation of the exciting laser driven physical phenomena taking place in materials coated with dielectric films. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast processes and thermal response upon excitation of two-layered complexes consisting of fused silica thin films placed on silicon substrates with ultrashort pulsed lasers in the Mid-IR spectral regime. Through the development of a theoretical model, we demonstrate that the control of the underlying ultrafast phenomena and the damage threshold (DT) of the substrate are achieved via an appropriate modulation of the thickness of the SiO2 film. It is shown that a decrease of DT by up to 27% compared to the absence of coating is feasible emphasising the impact of coatings of a lower refractive index than the substrate. Besides this, it is demonstrated that no absorption of energy occurs within the SiO2 layer, therefore the dynamics of the reflectivity of the two-layered complex is directly associated with the electron excitation in the substrate. These remarkable predictions can be employed for the development of new optical coatings and components for nonlinear optics and photonics for a large range of Mid-IR laser-based applications.</description>

      <title>Universality conditions of unified classical and quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15067</link>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm in computational neuroscience and machine learning, that exploits the non-linear dynamics of a dynamical system - the reservoir - to efficiently process time-dependent information. Since its introduction, it has exhibited remarkable capabilities in various applications. As widely known, classes of reservoir computers serve as universal approximators of functionals with fading memory. The construction of such universal classes often appears context-specific, but in fact, they follow the same principles. Here we present a unified theoretical framework and we propose a ready-made setting to secure universality. We test the result in the arising context of quantum reservoir computing.The analysis sheds light on a unified view of classical and quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>
