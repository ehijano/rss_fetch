      <title>Continuous Risk Factor Models: Analyzing Asset Correlations through Energy Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to financial risk analysis that does not rely on traditional price and market data, instead using market news to model assets as distributions over a metric space of risk factors. By representing asset returns as integrals over the scalar field of these risk factors, we derive the covariance structure between asset returns. Utilizing encoder-only language models to embed this news data, we explore the relationships between asset return distributions through the concept of Energy Distance, establishing connections between distributional differences and excess returns co-movements. This data-agnostic approach provides new insights into portfolio diversification, risk management, and the construction of hedging strategies. Our findings have significant implications for both theoretical finance and practical risk management, offering a more robust framework for modelling complex financial systems without depending on conventional market data.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Risk-Aversion and Size-dependent fees in FX Trading with Fitted Natural Actor-Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the popularity of artificial intelligence has surged due to its widespread application in various fields. The financial sector has harnessed its advantages for multiple purposes, including the development of automated trading systems designed to interact autonomously with markets to pursue different aims. In this work, we focus on the possibility of recognizing and leveraging intraday price patterns in the Foreign Exchange market, known for its extensive liquidity and flexibility. Our approach involves the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Fitted Natural Actor-Critic. This algorithm allows the training of an agent capable of effectively trading by means of continuous actions, which enable the possibility of executing orders with variable trading sizes. This feature is instrumental to realistically model transaction costs, as they typically depend on the order size. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of risk-averse approaches to induce the agent to adopt more conservative behavior. The proposed approaches have been empirically validated on EUR-USD historical data.</description>

      <title>On Cost-Sensitive Distributionally Robust Log-Optimal Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a novel \emph{cost-sensitive} distributionally robust log-optimal portfolio problem, where the investor faces \emph{ambiguous} return distributions, and a general convex transaction cost model is incorporated. The uncertainty in the return distribution is quantified using the \emph{Wasserstein} metric, which captures distributional ambiguity. We establish conditions that ensure robustly survivable trades for all distributions in the Wasserstein ball under convex transaction costs. By leveraging duality theory, we approximate the infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem with a finite convex program, enabling computational tractability for mid-sized portfolios. Empirical studies using S\&amp;P 500 data validate our theoretical framework: without transaction costs, the optimal portfolio converges to an equal-weighted allocation, while with transaction costs, the portfolio shifts slightly towards the risk-free asset, reflecting the trade-off between cost considerations and optimal allocation.</description>

      <title>Fractional Moments by the Moment-Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a random variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive new expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both central and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively simple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We label the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and can be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three applications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding densities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very difficult to obtain.</description>
