      <title>Entanglement as a resource for naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach to understanding the hierarchy problem is presented making use of topological aspects of the renormalisation group and the ER-EPR interpretation of entanglement. A common discussion of the renormalisation group, the black hole horizon and the expected entanglement between outgoing Hawking radiation and the interior, the cosmic censorship mechanism and the cosmological constant problem is envisaged.</description>

      <title>Energy relaxation in a vacuum capacitor-resistor circuit: measurement of multiple decays with divergent time constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05660v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the electrical energy in a resistor-vacuum capacitor circuit is shown to involve multiple relaxation processes, with dramatically different time constants. This is measured using a vacuum capacitor to eliminate the effect of a dielectric between the plates (polypropylene capacitors are shown to exhibit similar behavior). A simple phenomenological model accounts for this behavior in spite of the difficulty in applying Maxwell's equations to such a circuit. These results will lead to a revision of our understanding of the physics of circuits, having particular impact on applications that use capacitors as sensors in collecting precision data (such as found in quantum measurements and dielectric spectroscopy).</description>

      <title>Derivation of generalized Einstein's equations of gravitation in some non-inertial reference frames based on the theory of vacuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving the Einstein's equations for an isolated system of masses, V. Fock introduces harmonic reference frame and obtains an unambiguous solution. Further, he concludes that there exists a harmonic reference frame which is determined uniquely apart from a Lorentz transformation if suitable supplementary conditions are imposed. It is known that wave equations keep the same form under Lorentz transformations. Thus, we speculate that Fock's special harmonic reference frames may have provided us a clue to derive the Einstein's equations in some special class of non-inertial reference frames. Following this clue, generalized Einstein's equations in some special non-inertial reference frames are derived based on the theory of vacuum mechanics. If the field is weak and the reference frame is quasi-inertial, these generalized Einstein's equations reduce to Einstein's equations. Thus, this theory may also explain all the experiments which support the theory of general relativity. There exist some differences between this theory and the theory of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Collapse of wave functions in Schroedinger's wave mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that inelastic scattering leads to a collapse of the wave function within standard evolution through the Schroedinger equation, whereas elastic scattering will not collapse the wave function. Specifically, we find that the initial width of the emerging wave function in inelastic scattering is primarily determined by the size of the participating scattering center, but not by the width of the incoming wave function. This implies that dynamical collapse of the wave function through inelastic scattering, together with energy quantization in bound quantum systems, can explain the emergence of particle-like signals without the need to invoke the Born rule.</description>

      <title>Gravitation and Electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0106051</link>
      <description>arXiv:physics/0106051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently some hidden inconsistencies in high energy physics and cosmology have been articulated by several scholars. If we follow the usual description we get an unacceptably high cosmological constant as was noticed by Weinberg and others some decades ago. In this paper we point out that this is because of our continued description in terms of the Planck scale. While this works for gravitation, we have to consider a phase transition from the earlier Quantum Foam to the Compton scale that describes electromagnetism, and resolves the various problems. A consequence would be that in a total vacuum there would be no gravitation.</description>
