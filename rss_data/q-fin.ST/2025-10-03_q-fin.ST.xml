      <title>Mamba Outpaces Reformer in Stock Prediction with Sentiments from Top Ten LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stock market is extremely difficult to predict in the short term due to high market volatility, changes caused by news, and the non-linear nature of the financial time series. This research proposes a novel framework for improving minute-level prediction accuracy using semantic sentiment scores from top ten different large language models (LLMs) combined with minute interval intraday stock price data. We systematically constructed a time-aligned dataset of AAPL news articles and 1-minute Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices for the dates of April 4 to May 2, 2025. The sentiment analysis was achieved using the DeepSeek-V3, GPT variants, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and Mistral models through their APIs. Each article obtained sentiment scores from all ten LLMs, which were scaled to a [0, 1] range and combined with prices and technical indicators like RSI, ROC, and Bollinger Band Width. Two state-of-the-art such as Reformer and Mamba were trained separately on the dataset using the sentiment scores produced by each LLM as input. Hyper parameters were optimized by means of Optuna and were evaluated through a 3-day evaluation period. Reformer had mean squared error (MSE) or the evaluation metrics, and it should be noted that Mamba performed not only faster but also better than Reformer for every LLM across the 10 LLMs tested. Mamba performed best with LLaMA 3.3--70B, with the lowest error of 0.137. While Reformer could capture broader trends within the data, the model appeared to over smooth sudden changes by the LLMs. This study highlights the potential of integrating LLM-based semantic analysis paired with efficient temporal modeling to enhance real-time financial forecasting.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is vital for short-term electricity markets, yet the multivariate nature of day-ahead prices - spanning 24 consecutive hours - remains underexplored. At the same time, real-time decision-making requires methods that are both accurate and fast. We introduce an online algorithm for multivariate distributional regression models, allowing an efficient modelling of the conditional means, variances, and dependence structures of electricity prices. The approach combines multivariate distributional regression with online coordinate descent and LASSO-type regularization, enabling scalable estimation in high-dimensional covariate spaces. Additionally, we propose a regularized estimation path over increasingly complex dependence structures, allowing for early stopping and avoiding overfitting. In a case study of the German day-ahead market, our method outperforms a wide range of benchmarks, showing that modeling dependence improves both calibration and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we analyse the trade-off between predictive accuracy and computational costs for batch and online estimation and provide an high-performing open-source Python implementation in the ondil package.</description>
