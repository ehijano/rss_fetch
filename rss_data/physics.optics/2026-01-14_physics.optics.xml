      <title>Disorder-Induced Coherence Enables Control of Wave Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illuminating disordered samples with waveforms matched to transmission-matrix eigenchannels produces transmission ranging from complete to vanishing with strong variations in internal energy density, enabling the control of wave propagation for applications in imaging and communications. The origin of these departures from diffusive transport has remained a puzzle since phase coherence is rapidly lost due to scattering. We show here that coherence among waveguide modes grows with sample depth, shaping flux, energy density, and velocity in transmission eigenchannels throughout the sample.</description>

      <title>Canonical Clocks and Hidden Geometric Freedom in Self-Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-imaging represents a core hallmark of paraxial (quadratic)-wave evolution; yet, across its many realizations and generalizations over the past two centuries, the uniformity of recurrence planes along the propagation axis has been considered fundamental. However, by reframing the general phenomenon of self-imaging within its natural symplectic framework, we show that all self-imaging effects are necessarily tied to uniformly periodic recurrences in the canonical evolution coordinate -- metaplectic time -- and that the correspondence of that coordinate to the physical propagation axis represents an unexplored degree of freedom, which can be engineered arbitrarily by the initial transverse phase structure. Using a single programmable spatial light modulator, we demonstrate the construction of Talbot carpets characterized by recurrence spacings that accelerate and decelerate along the propagation axis, as well as those that follow polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal axial trajectories, all of which preserve exact reconstruction in the canonical metaplectic time. These results establish metaplectic time as the fundamental invariant of self-imaging and reveal a regime of controllable axial dynamics previously thought to be fixed.</description>

      <title>Vacuum-dressed superconductivity in NbN observed in a high-$Q$ terahertz cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Communications Using Effective-Medium-Slot Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-dielectric effective-medium-clad waveguides have been widely exploited in terahertz communications owing to their extremely low loss, low dispersion, and broad bandwidth. In this work, we propose a substrateless effective-medium-slot waveguide. Additionally, we introduce a taper-free interface that allows terahertz waves to directly couple from a metallic hollow waveguide without requiring dielectric insertion. By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems.</description>

      <title>Correlations of the phase gradients of the light wave propagating in a turbulent medium in the regime of weak scintillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically correlation functions of the phase of light waves that propagate through turbulent media. Special attention is paid to the off-diagonal component of the correlation function of the phase gradients which is insensitive to the outer scale of turbulence. The results of our simulations are in a good agreement with the analytical expressions obtained in Ref. \cite{KLS25}. Thus, we numerically confirm expectations based on uniformity of the perturbation theory for the logarithm of the envelope.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for phase correlations of a light wave propagating in a turbulent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlation functions of the phase of a light wave propagating through a turbulent medium. We use an equation for the logarithm of a wave packet envelope, which includes a second-order nonlinear term. Based on this equation, we develop a diagrammatic technique to calculate corrections to the correlation function obtained in the linear approximation. We calculate the first corrections determined by one-loop diagrams and find its asymptotic behaviors. Some non-perturbative conclusions are made using the symmetry properties of the equation. These results allow us to conclude that the applicability condition for the perturbation theory is the smallness of the Rytov dispersion, $\sigma_R^2$, and this condition holds uniformly over the distances between observation points.</description>

      <title>Measuring Nanoscale Torques with Cylindrical-Polarization-based Interferometric Scattering Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to observe rotational dynamics and measure underlying torques is a crucial component in understanding the function and mechanics of nanoscale systems. Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm. Relying on elastic scattering, cypiSCAT combines ultrafast temporal resolution with long observation times, making it well-suited for capturing rapid and rare rotational events and reaction steps in nanoscale biomolecular systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable, high pulse energy and narrow linewidth gas-filled fiber laser across near- and mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavelength widely tunable infrared fiber lasers that simultaneously deliver high pulse energies with narrow linewidths are critical for applications ranging from spectroscopy to nonlinear optics, yet achieving this combination has remained a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate that gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber Raman laser offers tunability across a broad spectral range from the near-infrared (~1.4 {\mu}m) to the mid-infrared (~4.6 {\mu}m), with near microjoule level high pulse energy and a narrow linewidth of few gigahertz or less. This performance arises from a unique pump laser design together with an optimized selection of gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fibers, opening a promising pathway toward compact, high-performance tunable infrared fiber-based sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power single-frequency fiber amplifiers are increasingly dominant in technologies that require high optical power, stability, and coherence simultaneously. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of their key characteristics, applications, architectures, and components. We then review the nonlinear acousto- and thermo-optical instabilities that limit power scaling and summarize the primary mitigation techniques. Finally, we discuss multimode excitation with wavefront shaping and anti-Stokes fluorescence cooling as two emerging strategies to circumvent the limitations of current approaches.</description>

      <title>Geometry Driven Spin Polarization Effects in Waveguiding Plasmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the modulation in the polarization-dependent optical behaviour of the waveguiding plasmonic crystal by varying the illumination and detection geometry. We employed the finite element method-based COMSOL simulation and Jones-Mueller formalisms to probe the variations in optical parameters by systematically varying the angle of incidence and azimuthal angle of the incident plane wave source, thereby quantifying the variations in the polarization anisotropy parameters. The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation. Its implications in the spin-orbit interaction of light in the plasmonic crystal system are discussed.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Landscape of Monolayer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: Experimental Discrepancies, Theoretical Advances, and Strain Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention because of their large binding energies due to weakly screened Coulomb interaction, and direct bandgap at the K/K$^\prime$ point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone featuring spin-polarised bands due to spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Experiment in Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA) Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometers provide high resolution and fast acquisition in a compact design, but their performance as dispersive instruments is sensitive to fabrication tolerances, component dimensions, and alignment. Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast quantum optics with attosecond control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Broadband wide-view all-dielectric handedness-preserving mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the theoretical design and experimental realization of a wideband, all-dielectric mirror that preserves the handedness of incident light upon reflection in the near-infrared range. The mirror consists of a high-contrast, near-subwavelength, one-dimensional dielectric grating on a Bragg mirror. We optimized this structure using a genetic algorithm and demonstrated its robustness against geometric imperfections and oblique incidence. Experimental reflection spectra measured under normal incidence in a circular polarization basis demonstrate a more than 100-nm-wide reflection band in which more than 98% of the reflected light preserves its handedness. The total reflection coefficient reached 80%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fabricated mirror maintains high performance even under oblique incidence for angles up to $\pm 15^\circ$. Owing to these unique characteristics, this mirror can serve as a reflective phase plate, making it an excellent candidate for the creation of a Fabry-P\'erot resonator for chiral light.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Path Qubits in Strong-Field Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective introduces attosecond path qubits: measurement-defined two-level subsystems that arise naturally in strong-field physics from the coherent interference of distinguishable quantum pathways. These effective qubits are dynamical superposition states formed during laser-driven sub-cycle electron motion and appear in diverse settings, including short-long trajectories in high-harmonic generation (HHG), early-late ionization bursts in multicolor fields, polarization-selective recombination channels, and momentum or energy-bin interference in above-threshold ionization (ATI). Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization. The attosecond qubits framework identifies new opportunities for ultrafast coherence metrology and for probing open quantum dynamics in strongly driven, time-dependent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Verification of continuous variable entanglement with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify transverse spatial entanglement of photon-pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down conversion using a nonlinear interferometric technique without relying on any coincidence detection. We experimentally demonstrate the violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion and of the Mancini-Giovannetti-Vitali-Tombesi criterion using single photon interference of one of the photons of the pairs. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The experimental results that we have obtained show good agreement with the theoretical values. Our method performs well under experimental losses and can be applied to highly non-degenerate sources, where there are no suitable detectors for one of the photons in the quantum state and our method could also be extended to the discrete degrees of freedom to certify high-dimensional (OAM) entanglement.</description>

      <title>Forbidden second harmonics in centrosymmetric bilayer crystals</title>

Abstract: Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moir\'e materials and twisted epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Integrated Quantum Photonic Logic Via Robust Directional Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing with integrated photonics requires quantum logic operations with high fidelity and robustness. Directional couplers, the fundamental elements enabling quantum interference and logic operations, are inherently sensitive to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations, leading to reduced gate fidelities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a passive design strategy that mitigates these errors by exploiting a stationary geometrical configuration in uniform directional couplers, where first-order variations in the coupling coefficient are intrinsically suppressed. The robust geometry is implemented in a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip hosting two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gates and its performance is directly compared to a non-optimized design. Measurements indicate a mean gate fidelity of $93.30 \pm 0.11\%$, representing a clear improvement over the non-robust implementation mean fidelity of $91.93 \pm 0.17\%$, without any active tuning or footprint increase. This performance approaches the theoretical limit of $93.78\%$, imposed by the imperfect source. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic fabrication noise confirm the observed enhancement and reveal consistent suppression of gate-level error rates. These results demonstrate a compact, fabrication-tolerant building block for scalable, fault-tolerant photonic quantum circuits and highlight the power of passive geometric error mitigation in quantum hardware design.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Bend-Resolved Modal Basis in Deformed Multimode Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mode mixing in optical fibers caused by mechanical bending induces perturbations that distort the spatial field profile of coherent beams as they propagate through few-mode or multimode fibers. The observed output from a bent fiber commonly appears as complex speckle, which is challenging to relate directly to the underlying deformation, particularly in continuously varying systems such as aerially deployed fibers or fiber-integrated sensors in mechanical structures. We introduce a novel method for constructing a complete deformation-resolved orthonormal modal basis that captures the optical response of a multimode fiber across a range of controlled mechanical deformations. The basis is derived via a two-stage singular value decomposition framework that initially constructs deformation-specific orthonormal mode sets from speckle pattern correlation matrices and subsequently decomposes the aggregated sets to produce a unified functional basis that comprehensively spans the deformation-induced modal subspace supported by the fiber. This hierarchical framework yields an energy-balanced representation that isolates statistically dominant field components across all deformation states, approximates superpositions of the fiber's propagation-invariant modes, systematically encodes deformation-induced perturbations, and supports robust decomposition of output fields across varying mechanical conditions. Such a basis enables tracking of mechanically induced modal evolution in deployed fibers, supporting distributed sensing, network resilience, and predictive fault diagnostics, with potential for integration into mode-division multiplexing systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Exceptional Points Induced by Non-Markovian Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are central to non-Hermitian physics because of their unique properties and broad application prospects. While extensively studied in parity-time ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$)-symmetric systems and under Markovian dynamics, their exploration in broader pseudo-Hermitian settings, particularly in those involving non-Markovian environments, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate a pseudo-Hermitian system consisting of three coupled optical cavities interacting with non-Markovian environments. Compared to the Markovian baseline, we demonstrate that the emergence of non-Markovian memory effects enlarges the dimensionality of the parameter space of the system, thereby giving rise to higher-order EPs. Moreover, we observe that the pseudo-Hermitian system with an effective gain induced by coherent perfect absorption enables the higher-order EPs to be directly read out from the output spectrum. We also find that breaking the symmetry of the parameter space of the system reduces the order of the EPs. Furthermore, we note that the non-Markovian mechanism for generating higher-order EPs extends beyond pseudo-Hermitian systems to generic non-Hermitian quantum systems. Additionally, possible experimental implementations based on a superconducting circuit are also discussed. Our findings reveal how non-Markovianity enhances the sensitivity of the system and provide a theoretical insight into the experimental observation of higher-order EPs.</description>

Abstract: Topological photonics was embarked from realizing the first-order chiral state in gyromagnetic media, but its higher-order states were mostly studied in dielectric lattice instead. In this paper we theoretically unveil a hierarchy of topological phases under broken time-reversal symmetry, which include the first-order Chern, and the second-order dipole, quadrupole phases. Concretely, by relaxing a certain spatial symmetry of unit cell, versatile topological phases including both edge and corner states can be established to transit around, with bandgap closures marking the phase boundaries. Our results on gyromagnetic photonic crystals may broaden the scope of sublattice engineering design for topological phase manipulation, potentially enabling multifunctional disorder-resistant waveguides and integrated photonic circuits for information communication.</description>

      <title>Layer-Wise Anomaly Detection in Directed Energy Deposition using High-Fidelity Fringe Projection Profilometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Bifurcations in Kerr Ring and Fabry-Perot Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear phenomena such as optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking play a central role in Kerr resonators, and are increasingly exploited in photonic integrated circuits for all-optical information processing. In this work, we present an analytical framework allowing to find the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators, which can be generalized to other nonlinear systems. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system's full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations follow directly from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. Together, these results unify optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking within a single analytical framework, and offer a route toward improved control of nonlinear optical systems, and the design of photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Topological Pumping in Photonic Waveguides Based on Global Adiabatic Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic topological pumping enables robust transport of energy and information, yet its operational speed is fundamentally constrained by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which necessitates prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here, we propose a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC) that establishes an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square nonadiabaticity. Building on this framework, we introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion to minimize spatial inhomogeneity, allowing for a safe increase in mean nonadiabaticity without compromising fidelity. We experimentally demonstrate this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves a fidelity of &gt;0.95 with a fivefold reduction in device length compared to conventional schemes, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with system size, and maintains robust performance across a bandwidth exceeding 400 nm. This GAC framework provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across both quantum and classical topological platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.</description>

      <title>Many body effects in the line radiative transfer equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation for spectral lines from an extended gas is derived from first principles, treating the gas as a system of many atoms/molecules rather than isolated ones. Line broadening effects are assumed to be dominated by particle motions (Doppler effect), but collisional broadening effects are included in the impact approximation. We retrieve the canonical radiative transfer equation under the condition that the optical depth over a coherence length, defined as the transition-levels lifetime times the speed of light, is much lower than unity. For other cases, the line radiative transfer equation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends exponentially on a quantity that we call the coherent optical depth. We compute that many-body effects affect line radiative transfer of strongly emitting and astronomically ubiquitous radio- and submillimeter lines, such as the HI 21 cm line, and rotational transitions of the main isotopologue of CO. These results imply that care must be taken when interpreting observations relying on these lines, as many-body effects can significantly alter emergent line profiles and bias inferred physical conditions of the emitting gas. Finally, we propose a simple laboratory experiment that would reveal many-body effects in the transfer of radiation, which could furthermore offer a cost-effective means of constraining fundamental molecular parameters.</description>

We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussian envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>

      <title>Response regimes in on-chip THz spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.</description>
