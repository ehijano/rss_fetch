      <title>Incentivizing Knowledge Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal design of relational contracts that incentivize an expert to share specialized knowledge with a novice. While the expert fears that a more knowledgeable novice may later erode his future rents, a third-party principal is willing to allocate her resources to facilitate knowledge transfer. In the unique profit-maximizing contract between the principal and the expert, the expert is asked to train the novice as much as possible, for free, in the initial period; knowledge transfers then proceed gradually and perpetually, with the principal always compensating the expert for his future losses immediately upon verifying the training he provided; even in the long run, a complete knowledge transfer might not be attainable. We further extend our analysis to an overlapping-generation model, accounting for the retirement of experts and the career progression of novices.</description>

      <title>Value of History in Social Learning: Applications to Markets for History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social learning environments, agents acquire information from both private signals and the observed actions of predecessors, referred to as history. We define the value of history as the gain in expected payoff from accessing both the private signal and history, compared to relying on the signal alone. We first characterize the information structures that maximize this value, showing that it is highest under a mixture of full information and no information. We then apply these insights to a model of markets for history, where a monopolistic data seller collects and sells access to history. In equilibrium, the seller's dynamic pricing becomes the value of history for each agent. This gives the seller incentives to increase the value of history by designing the information structure. The seller optimal information discloses less information than the socially optimal level.</description>

      <title>Dynamic SINR-Guided Iterative Interference Cancellation for ODDM Systems in Doubly Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has recently gained significant attention as a promising candidate to promote the communication reliability in high-mobility environments. Low complexity signal detection is one of the most significant challenges for ODDM over general physical channels, due to the large channel spreading caused by the fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity data detection for ODDM system by utilizing iterative interference cancellation. Based on the theoretical analysis of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) during the iteration, a dynamic SINR-guided approach is proposed to provide a better initialization result. Specifically, we analyze the SINR of each time domain sample before initial estimate with consideration of off-grid delay and Doppler shifts. The iteration is then started from the multi-carrier symbol index which has the best SINR. The corresponding interference is then eliminated for other time domain samples while the SINR for symbol awaiting detection is also updated. Based on the updated SINR, the next multi-carrier symbol index is selected for the same processing until all data symbols have been initialized. Finally, we update the SINR synchronously until the end of the initialization. Simulation experiments indicate that our proposed algorithms demonstrate satisfying convergence and error performance while avoiding the huge complexity introduced by full linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) initialization.</description>

      <title>Assignment Markets with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies markets where a set of indivisible items is sold to bidders with quasilinear, unit-demand valuations, subject to a hard budget constraint. Without financial constraints the well-known assignment market model of Shapley and Shubik (1971) allows for a simple ascending auction format that is incentive-compatible, and strongly Pareto-optimal. However, this auction model does not capture the possibility that bidders face hard budget constraints. We design an iterative auction that depends on demand queries and an easily verifiable additional condition to maintain the properties in the presence of budget constraints. If instead this additional condition does not hold, incentive compatibility and core stability are at odds, and we cannot hope to achieve strong Pareto optimality in a simple ascending auction even with truthful bidding. Moreover, even in a complete information model where the auctioneer has access to valuations and budget constraints, the problem is NP-hard.</description>
