      <title>Photonic Millimeter-wave Generation Beyond the Cavity Thermal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation communications, radar and navigation systems will extend and exploit the higher bandwidth of the millimeter-wave domain for increased communication data rates as well as radar with higher sensitivity and increased spatial resolution. However, realizing these advantages will require the generation of millimeter-wave signals with low phase noise in simple and compact form-factors. The rapidly developing field of photonic integration addresses this challenge and provides a path toward simplified and portable, low-noise mm-wave generation for these applications. We leverage these advances by heterodyning two silicon photonic chip lasers, phase-locked to the same miniature Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity to demonstrate a simple framework for generating low-noise millimeter-waves with phase noise below the thermal limit of the F-P cavity. Specifically, we generate 94.5 GHz and 118.1 GHz millimeter-wave signals with phase noise of -117 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset, decreasing to -120 dBc/Hz at 40 kHz offset, a record low value for such photonic devices. We achieve this with existing technologies that can be integrated into a platform less than $\approx$ 10 mL in volume. Our work illustrates the significant potential and advantages of low size, weight, and power (SWaP) photonic-sourced mm-waves for communications and sensing.</description>

      <title>Tunable linear-optical phase amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine lossless, phase-only transformations with fully-transmitting linear-optical scatterers to define the principle of linear-optical phase amplification. This enables a physical phase shift $\phi$ to be nonlinearly mapped to a new space $\gamma(\phi)$ using linear optics, resulting in a completely general and enhanced phase shifter that can replace any standard one. A particular phase amplifier is experimentally realized, allowing the phase enhancement parameter $d\gamma/d\phi$ to be continuously tuned. Placing this enhanced phase shifter in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer led to an intensity-phase slope more than twenty times steeper than what can be obtained with its unamplified counterpart.</description>

      <title>A Thin Film Lithium Niobate Near-Infrared Platform for Multiplexing Quantum Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical quantum networks will require quantum nodes consisting of many memory qubits. This in turn will increase the complexity of the photonic circuits needed to control each qubit and will require strategies to multiplex memories and overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of their transition frequencies. Integrated photonics operating at visible to near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range, compatible with the transition frequencies of leading quantum memory systems, can provide solutions to these needs. In this work, we realize a VNIR thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) integrated photonics platform with the key components to meet these requirements. These include low-loss couplers ($&lt;$ 1 dB/facet), switches ($&gt;$ 20 dB extinction), and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators ($&gt;$ 50 GHz). With these devices we demonstrate high-efficiency and CW-compatible frequency shifting ($&gt;$ 50 $\%$ efficiency at 15 GHz), as well as simultaneous laser amplitude and frequency control through a nested modulator structure. Finally, we highlight an architecture for multiplexing quantum memories using the demonstrated TFLN components, and outline how this platform can enable a 2-order of magnitude improvement in entanglement rates over single memory nodes. Our results demonstrate that TFLN can meet the necessary performance and scalability benchmarks to enable large-scale quantum nodes.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization for high efficiency metasurfaces: theory and implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex non-local behavior makes designing high efficiency and multifunctional metasurfaces a significant challenge. While using libraries of meta-atoms provide a simple and fast implementation methodology, pillar to pillar interaction often imposes performance limitations. On the other extreme, inverse design based on topology optimization leverages non-local coupling to achieve high efficiency, but leads to complex and difficult to fabricate structures. In this paper, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally a shape optimization method that enables high efficiency metasurfaces while providing direct control of the structure complexity. The proposed method provides a path towards manufacturability of inverse-designed high efficiency metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoders for the design of Plasmonic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning has been a critical part of designing inverse design methods that are computationally efficient and accurate. An example of this is the design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network in order to solve this problem, but in many cases the solution is unable to generate structures that provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to the target spectrum, the Bidirectional Adversarial Autoencoder is able to generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a result the proposed model represents an important advance towards the generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced metasurface design.</description>

      <title>Solving Maxwell's Equations Using Polarimetry Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxwell's equations are solved when the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field are determined at all points in space. Generally, the Stokes parameters can only capture the amplitude and polarization state of the electromagnetic field in the radiation (far) zone. Therefore, the measurement of the Stokes parameters is, in general, insufficient to solve Maxwell's equations. In this Letter, we solve Maxwell's equations for a set of objects widely used in Nanophotonics using the Stokes parameters alone. Our method for solving Maxwell's equations endows the Stokes parameters an even more fundamental role in the electromagnetic scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional cascaded superfluorescent lasing in air enabled by resonant third harmonic photon exchange from nitrogen to argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-free lasing in atmospheric air has stimulated intense research towards fundamental understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. In this Letter, we identify a new mechanism -- third harmonic photon mediated resonant energy transfer pathway leading to population inversion in argon via initial three-photon excitation of nitrogen molecules irradiated by intense 261 nm pulses -- that enables bidirectional two-color cascaded lasing in atmospheric air. By making pump-probe measurements, we conclusively show that such cascaded lasing results from superfluorescence (SF) rather than amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Such cascaded lasing with the capability of producing bidirectional multicolor coherent pulses opens additional possibilities for remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>The multi-mode Bessel-Gaussian beams OAM holographic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, We prepare a multi-mode Bessel Gaussian (MBG) selective hologram by stacking different mode combinations of Bessel-Gaussian phases on a multi-mode Bessel-Gaussian saved hologram in stages. Using a multi-mode BG beam with opposite combination parameters to illuminate the MBG-OAM hologram, the target image can be reconstructed after Fourier transform, and the sampling constant of this scheme is flexible and controllable. The encoding of holograms includes multiple BG mode combination parameters. When decoding incident light, the corresponding mode combination parameters must be met in order to reconstruct the image. This can effectively improve the security of OAM holography and the number of multiplexing channels.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic representation and design of depolarizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternions have been used to represent polarization states and polarization operators. But so far, only polarizers, dichroic or non-depolarizing devices have been represented in that way. We propose a quaternionic representation of perfect as well as partial depolarizers. It leads us to design actual setups for producing natural (unpolarized) light from an arbitrary partially or completely polarized wave or for reducing the degree of polarization of a wave. We conclude by making the link with Azzam's polarization orthogonalization problem.</description>

      <title>Resonant structure for improved directionality and extraction of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent atomic defects, especially in dielectric materials, such as diamond are quite promising for several emerging quantum applications. However, efficient light extraction, directional emission, and narrow spectral emission are key challenges. We have designed dielectric metasurface exploiting Mie-resonance and the Kerker condition to address these issues. Our designed diamond metasurface, tailored for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers in diamond, predicts up to 500x improvement in the collection of 637 nm (zero phonon line) photons over that from the bare diamond. Our design achieves highly directional emission, predominantly emitting in a 20 degree lobe in the forward direction. This makes light collection more efficient, including for fiber-based collection. The predicted results are stable against the position of the emitter placed in the metaelement, thus alleviating the challenging fabrication requirement of precise positioning of the defect center. Equally importantly, our design approach can be applied to enhance single photon emission also from other defects such as SiV, other materials such as hBN, and other sources such as quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Statistical estimation theory detection limits for label-free imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of label-free microscopy techniques has significantly improved our ability to precisely characterize biochemical targets, enabling non-invasive visualization of cellular organelles and tissue organization. Each label-free method has specific benefits, drawbacks, and varied varied sensitivity under measurement conditions across different types of specimens. To link all these disparate label-free optical interactions together and to compare detection sensitivity of these modalities, we investigate their sensitivity within the framework of statistical estimation theory. This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for evaluating the bounds for signal detection with label-free microscopy methods, including second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS), stimulated Raman loss (SRL), stimulated Raman gain (SRG), stimulated emission (SE), impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), transient absorption (TA), and photothermal effect (PTE). A general model for signal generation induced by optical scattering is developed. Based on this model, the information obtained is quantitatively analyzed using Fisher information, and the fundamental constraints on estimation precision are evaluated through the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).</description>

      <title>Backaction suppression in levitated optomechanics using reflective boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show theoretically that the noise due to laser induced backaction acting on a small nanosphere levitated in a standing-wave trap can be considerably reduced by utilising a suitable reflective boundary. We examine the spherical mirror geometry as a case study of this backaction suppression effect, discussing the theoretical and experimental constraints. We study the effects of laser recoil directly, by analysing optical force fluctuations acting on a dipolar particle trapped at the centre of a spherical mirror. We also compute the corresponding measurement imprecision in an interferometric, shot-noise-limited position measurement, using the formalism of Fisher information flow. Our results show that the standing-wave trapping field is necessary for backaction suppression in three dimensions, and they satisfy the Heisenberg limit of detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study of laser pulse duration influence on the terahertz emission during single-color filamentation is carried out. It is shown that for each terahertz frequency there is an optimal laser pulse duration providing maximal generation at constant pulse energy. It is demonstrated that longer pulses are required for stronger low-frequency terahertz emission, thus despite considerable laser peak power decreasing the terahertz radiation yield can be increased by more than 3 times.</description>

      <title>Three-Wave Mixing between Continuous-Wave and Ultrafast Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical frequency combs allow for both high spectral and temporal resolution in molecular spectroscopy and have become a powerful tool in many areas of chemistry and physics. Ultrafast lasers and frequency combs generated from ultrafast mode-locked lasers often need to be converted to other wavelengths. Commonly used wavelength conversions are optical parametric oscillators, which require an external optical cavity, and supercontinuum generation combined with optical parametric amplifiers. Whether commercial or home-built, these systems are complex and costly. Here we propose an alternative, simple, and easy-to-implement approach to tunable frequency comb ultrafast lasers enabled by new continuous-wave laser technology. Sum-frequency generation between a Nd:YAG continuous-wave laser and a Yb:fiber femtosecond frequency comb in a beta-barium borate (BBO) crystal is explored. The resulting sum-frequency beam is a pulsed frequency comb with the same repetition rate as the Yb:fiber source. SNLO simulation software was used to simulate the results and provide benchmarks for designing future system to achieve wavelength conversion and tunability in difficult spectral regions.</description>

      <title>Computational ghost imaging with hybrid transforms by integrating Hadamard, discrete cosine, and Haar matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scenario of ghost imaging with hybrid transform approach is proposed by integrating Hadamard, discrete cosine, and Haar matrices. The measurement matrix is formed by the Kronecker product of the two different transform matrices. The image information can be conveniently reconstructed by the corresponding inverse matrices. In experiment, six hybridization sets are performed in computational ghost imaging. For an object of staggered stripes, only one bucket signal survives in the Hadamard-cosine, Haar-Hadamard, and Haar-cosine hybridization sets, demonstrating flexible image compression. For a handmade windmill object, the quality factors of the reconstructed images vary with the hybridization sets. Sub-Nyquist sampling can be applied to either or both of the different transform matrices in each hybridization set in experiment. The hybridization method can be extended to apply more transforms at once. Ghost imaging with hybrid transforms may find flexible applications in image processing, such as image compression and image encryption.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk skin modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum steganography is a powerful method for information security where communications between a sender and receiver are disguised as naturally occurring noise in a channel. We encoded the phase and amplitude of weak coherent laser states such that a third party monitoring the communications channel, measuring the flow of optical states through the channel, would see an amalgamation of states indistinguishable from thermal noise light. Using quantum state tomography, we experimentally reconstructed the density matrices for artificially engineered thermal states and spontaneous emission from an optical amplifier and verified a state fidelity F&gt;0.98 when compared with theoretical thermal states.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach to perform the simulation of a single qubit quantum algorithm using laser beams. Leveraging the polarization states of photonic qubits, and inspired by variational quantum eigensolvers, we develop a variational quantum algorithm implementing a clustering procedure following the approach proposed by some of us in SciRep 13, 13284 (2023). A key aspect of our research involves the utilization of non-orthogonal states within the photonic domain, harnessing the potential of polarization schemes to reproduce unitary circuits. By mapping these non-orthogonal states into polarization states, we achieve an efficient and versatile quantum information processing unit which serves as a clustering device for a diverse set of datasets.</description>

      <title>Strong broadband intensity noise squeezing from near-infrared to terahertz frequencies in semiconductor lasers with nonlinear dissipation</title>

Abstract: The generation and application of squeezed light have long been central goals of quantum optics, enabling sensing below the standard quantum limit, optical quantum computing platforms, and more. Intensity noise squeezing of bright (coherent) states, in contrast to squeezed vacuum, is relatively underdeveloped. Bright squeezing has been generated directly through nonlinear optical processes or ``quietly pumped'' semiconductor lasers. However, these methods suffer from weak squeezing limits, narrow operating wavelength ranges, and have not been explored at large bandwidths. Here, we show how semiconductor lasers with sharp intensity-dependent dissipation can support highly broadband intensity noise squeezing from infrared (IR) to terahertz (THz) wavelengths, the latter of which has remained unexplored in quantum noise studies. Our protocol realizes strongly ($&gt;10$ dB) intensity noise-squeezed intracavity quantum states, which could create a new regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments, as well as strong output squeezing surpassing gigahertz bandwidths. Furthermore, we show how the same systems also create self-pulsing and bistable mean field behavior, enabling control of light in both the temporal and noise domains. The existence of these multiple functionalities in both the classical and quantum mechanical domains in a single semiconductor laser platform, from IR to THz wavelengths, could enable advances in on-chip quantum optical communication, computing, and sensing across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>GaSb-based Interband Cascade Laser with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an interband cascade laser (ICL) emitting at 5.2 {\mu}m consisting of an 8-stage active region and a hybrid cladding composed of outer plasmon-enhanced InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 and inner InAs/AlSb superlattice claddings. The hybrid cladding architecture shows an increase in mode-confinement in the active region by 11.2 % according to the simulation. This is a consequence of a significantly lower refractive index of plasmon-enhanced claddings. The threshold current density is 242 A/cm^2 in pulsed operation at room temperature. This is the lowest value reported to date for ICLs emitting at wavelengths longer than 5 {\mu}m. We also report close to record value threshold power density of 840 W/cm^2 for ICLs at such wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Hermitian stochastic methodology for X-ray superfluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally study the synchronization of chaos generated by semiconductor lasers in a cascade injection configuration, i.e., a tunable master laser is used to generate chaos by optical injection in a transmitter laser that injects light into a receiver laser. Chaos synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver lasers is achieved with a correlation coefficient of 90 % for a measurement bandwidth up to 35 GHz. Two parameter regions of good synchronization are found, corresponding to the alignment of the oscillation frequencies of the receiver laser with either the transmitter laser or the master laser.</description>

Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>

      <title>Cavity Moir\'e Materials: Controlling Magnetic Frustration with Quantum Light-Matter Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum spin liquid.</description>

Abstract: Conventional heterodyne readout schemes are now under reconsideration due to the realization of techniques to evade its inherent 3 dB signal-to-noise penalty. The application of high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed states can further improve the readout sensitivity of audio-band signals. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate quantum-enhanced heterodyne readout of two spatially distinct interferometers with direct optical signal combination, circumventing the 3 dB heterodyne signal-to-noise penalty. Applying a high-frequency, spectrally entangled, two-mode squeezed state, we show further signal-to-noise improvement of an injected audio band signal of 3.5 dB. This technique is applicable for quantum-limited high-precision experiments, with application to searches for quantum gravity, gravitational wave detection and wavelength-multiplexed quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking can occur in systems periodically driven at a certain period. We predict a spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry in an atom-cavity system without external driving, in which a time scale is determined by the time of light bypass of the resonator. We demonstrate that there is a parameter range, in which a system state returns to its initial state only after two bypasses of the resonator. We believe that the predicted phenomenon opens a way to a new direction in the time crystal field.</description>

      <title>High-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator in a portable storage container</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Interface Modes in Honeycomb Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>
