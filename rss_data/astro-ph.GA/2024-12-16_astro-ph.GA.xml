      <title>Milky Way dark matter distribution or MOND test from vertical stellar kinematics with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical stellar kinematics+density can be used to trace the dark matter distribution [or the equivalent phantom mass in a Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) scenario] through Jeans equations. In this paper, we want to improve this type of analysis by making use of the recent data of the 6D information from the Gaia-DR3 survey in the anticenter and the Galactic poles to obtain the dynamical mass distribution near plane regions, including extended kinematics over a wide region of 8 kpc$&lt;R&lt;$22 kpc, $|z|&lt;3$ kpc.
  Our conclusions are as follows: (i) the model of the spherical dark matter halos and the MOND model are compatible with the data; (ii) the model of the disky dark matter (with density proportional to the gas density) is excluded; (iii) the total lack of dark matter (there is only visible matter) within Newtonian gravity is compatible with the data; for instance, at solar Galactocentric radius, we obtained $\Sigma=39\pm 18$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for $z=1.05$ kpc, compatible with the expected value for visible matter alone of 44 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, thus allowing zero dark matter. Similarly, for $R&gt;R_\odot$, $z=1.05$ kpc: $\Sigma=28.7\pm 9.6$, $23.0\pm 5.7$, $16.9\pm 5.8$, $11.4\pm 6.6$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, respectively, for $R=10,13,16,19$ kpc, compatible with visible matter alone. Larger error bars in comparison with previous works are not due to worse data or a more awkward technique but to a stricter modeling of the stellar distribution.</description>

      <title>Jetted Seyfert Galaxies at z = 0: Simulating Feedback Effects on Galactic Morphology and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model feedback from Seyfert-type supermassive black hole (SMBH) jets onto galaxies with identical dark matter (DM) halos of log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11.8. The low mass, ~10$^6$ M$_\odot$, seed SMBHs, have been introduced when the parent DM halos have reached log(M/M$_\odot$) ~ 11, at z ~ 3.7. In a controlled experiment, we vary only the efficiency of the SMBH accretion and focus on galaxies and their immediate environment properties. Our results show that the AGN jet feedback has a substantial effect on the basic properties of Seyfert-type galaxies, such as morphology, gas fraction and distribution, star formation rate and distribution, bulge-to-disk ratio, DM halo baryon fraction, and properties of circumgalactic medium (CGM) and beyond. These have been compared to a galaxy with supernovae only feedback. We focus on the energy deposition by the jet in the ISM and IGM, and follow the expansion of the multiple jet cocoons to 2 Mpc. We find that the jet-ISM interaction gradually pushes the star formation to larger radii with increasing accretion efficiency, which results in increased mass of the outer stellar disk, which is best fit as a double-exponential disk. Furthermore, we compare our galaxies and their properties with the observed nearby Seyfert galaxies, including the scaling relations, and find a close agreement, although statistical analysis of observed Seyferts is currently missing. In a forthcoming paper, we focus on evolution of these objects at z&lt;10 and study the effect of the SMBH seeding redshift on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey: Properties of X-ray- and SED-selected AGNs in Bright Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with $S_{\mathrm{870}\, \mu \mathrm{m}}=0.7\text{--}19.2\,\mathrm{mJy}$ at $z=0\text{--}6$. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify $25^{+6}_{-5}$\% of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at $z\sim2$, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify $47^{+16}_{-15}$\% of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat V: Helium Enrichment in $\omega$ Centauri as a Function of Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the helium enhancement in stars is critical for understanding the formation mechanisms of multiple populations in star clusters. However, measuring helium variations for many stars within a cluster remains observationally challenging. We use Hubble Space Telescope photometry combined with MUSE spectroscopic data for over 7,200 red-giant branch stars in \omc\ to measure helium differences between distinct groups of stars as a function of metallicity separating the impact of helium enhancements from other abundance variations on the pseudo-color (chromosome) diagrams. Our results show that stars at all metallicities have subpopulations with significant helium enhancement ($\Delta Y_{min} \gtrsim$ 0.11). We find a rapid increase in helium enhancement from low metallicities ($\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.05}$ to $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.92})$, with this enhancement leveling out at \deltay\ $= 0.154$ at higher metallicities. The fraction of helium-enhanced stars steadily increases with metallicity ranging from 10\% at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.04}$ to over $90\%$ at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.04}$. This study is the first to examine helium enhancement across the full range of metallicities in \omc{}, providing new insight into its formation history and additional constraints on enrichment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Radio Galaxies in SIMBA: A MIGHTEE Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a qualitative comparison between the host and black hole properties of radio galaxies in the MeerKAT GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration~(MIGHTEE) survey with the radio galaxy population in the SIMBA suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The MIGHTEE data includes a $\sim$1deg$^{2}$ pointing of the COSMOS field observed at 1.28GHz with the MeerKAT radio telescope and cross-matched with multi-wavelength counterparts to provide classifications of high and low excitation radio galaxies (HERGs and LERGs) along with their corresponding host properties. We compare the properties of the MIGHTEE HERGs and LERGs with that predicted by the SIMBA simulations where HERGs and LERGs are defined as radio galaxies dominated by cold or hot mode accretion respectively. We consider stellar masses $\;{M}_{*}$, star formation rates SFR, AGN bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, and Eddington fraction $f_{\rm Edd}$, as a function of 1.4GHz radio luminosity and redshift. In both MIGHTEE and SIMBA, the properties of HERGs and LERGs are similar across all properties apart from SFRs due to differences in host cold gas content in SIMBA. We predict a population of HERGs with low $f_{\rm Edd}$ in SIMBA that are confirmed in the MIGHTEE observations and tied to the faint population at low $z$. The predictions from SIMBA with the MIGHTEE observations describe a regime where our understanding of the radio galaxy dichotomy breaks down, challenging our understanding of the role of AGN accretion and feedback in the faint population of radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>CO-CHANGES II: spatially resolved IRAM 30M CO line observations of 23 nearby edge-on spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular gas, as the fuel for star formation, and its relationship with atomic gas are crucial for understanding how galaxies regulate their star forming (SF) activities. We conducted IRAM 30m observations of 23 nearby spiral galaxies from the CHANG-ES project to investigatet the distribution of molecular gas and the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Combining these results with atomic gas masses from previous studies, we aim to investigate the scaling relations that connect the molecular and atomic gas masses with stellar masses and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Based on spatially resolved observations of the three CO lines, we calculated the total molecular gas masses, the ratios between different CO lines, and derived physical parameters such as temperature and optical depth. The median line ratios for nuclear/disk regions are 8.6/6.1 (^{12}\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\mathrm{CO}\ J=1{-}0) and 0.53/0.39 (^{12}\mathrm{CO}\ J=2{-}1/J=1{-}0). Molecular gas mass derived from ^{13}\mathrm{CO} is correlated but systematically lower than that from ^{12}\mathrm{CO}. Most galaxies follow the spatially resolved SF scaling relation with a median gas depletion timescale of approximately 1 Gyr, while a few exhibit shorter timescales of approximately 0.1 Gyr. The molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio correlates strongly with stellar mass, consistent with previous studies. Galaxies with lower stellar masses show an excess of atomic gas, indicating less efficient conversion to molecular gas. Most galaxies tightly follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but NGC 2992 and NGC 4594 deviate from the relation due to different physical factors. We find that the ratio of the cold gas (comprising molecular and atomic gas) to the total baryon mass decreases with the gravitational potential of the galaxy, as traced by rotation velocity, which could be due to gas consumption in SF or being heated to the hot phase.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Matter Disc Model in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from the LITTLE THINGS Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an analysis of the velocity field of dwarf galaxies in the LITTLE THINGS sample, focusing on deriving 2D velocity maps that encompass both the transverse and radial velocity fields. Within the range of radial distances where velocity anisotropies are sufficiently small for the disc to be considered rotationally supported, and where the warped geometry of the disc can be neglected, we reconstructed the rotation curve while taking into account the effect of the asymmetric drift. To fit the rotation curves, we employed the standard halo model and the dark matter disc (DMD) model, which assumes that dark matter is primarily confined to the galactic discs and can be traced by the distribution of \HI{}. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the fits from the DMD model are statistically comparable to those obtained using the standard halo model, but the inferred masses of the galaxies in the DMD model are approximately 10 to 100 times smaller than the masses inferred in the standard halo model. In the DMD model, the inner slope of the rotation curve is directly related to a linear combination of the surface density profiles of the stellar and gas components, which generally exhibit a flat core. Consequently, the observation of a linear relationship between the rotation curve and the radius in the disc central regions is consistent with the framework of the DMD model.</description>

      <title>Identification of ram pressure stripping features in galaxies using citizen science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ram pressure stripped galaxies are rare cases of environmental evolution in action. However, our ability to understand these galaxies is limited by the small number of identified galaxies experiencing ram pressure stripping (RPS). Our aim is to explore the efficacy of citizen science classifications in identifying ram pressure stripped galaxies, and use this to aid in motivating new samples of ram pressure stripped candidates. We compile a sample of over 200 known ram pressure stripped galaxies from existing literature, with morphological classifications obtained from Galaxy Zoo. We compare these galaxies with magnitude and redshift-matched comparison cluster and field galaxies. Additionally, we create a sample of SDSS cluster galaxies, with morphological classifications similar to known ram pressure stripped galaxies, and compare the fraction of potential new RPS candidates against control samples. We find that ram pressure stripped galaxies exhibit a higher proportion of odd and irregular morphological classifications compared to field and cluster comparison samples. This trend is particularly pronounced in galaxies displaying strong optical ram pressure stripping features, but absent from galaxies with only radio tails. We find that SDSS galaxies with Galaxy Zoo classifications consistent with the known RPS galaxies have a higher fraction of visible ram pressure stripping features ($19\%$) compared with other cluster galaxies ($12\%$) when classified by experts. We identify 101 new ram pressure stripping candidate galaxies through these expert classifications. We demonstrate that indirect morphological classifications from citizen science projects can increase the efficiency in which new stripping candidates are found. Projects such as Galaxy Zoo can aid in the identification of ram pressure stripped galaxies that are key to understanding galaxy evolution in clusters.</description>

      <title>Direct Images of the Cosmic Web of Intergalactic and Circumgalactic Gas in the Distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the baryonic matter of the Universe resides in a highly-ionized gaseous intergalactic medium. This gas flows along dark-matter filaments toward galaxy superclusters, clusters, and groups until it pools around the galaxies into a circumgalactic medium. Eventually, the gas settles into the interstellar medium of the galaxies, where it fuels the successive generations of star formation that ultimately produce the stars and heavy elements that make up galaxies today. The gas has been studied for decades using absorption lines produced by Hydrogen and various ions of heavy elements in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). But directly imaging the extremely faint glow of this "cosmic web" of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas has remained an elusive goal of observational cosmology. Some recent progress has been made by using imaging spectrographs to record high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emission, although over only very narrow fields of view. Here we report direct images of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas in the distant Universe obtained using the Condor Array Telescope that we purposely built to reach extremely low-surface-brightness sensitivities over very wide fields of view. We show that these images directly detect and characterize the imprint of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the cosmic web at an overwhelming statistical significance. By stacking portions of the images centered on tens of thousands of galaxies of known redshift, we show that they also reveal extremely faint emission from H$^0$, C$^{3+}$, and Mg$^+$ and absorption from cosmic dust in the tenuous outskirts of the galaxies. Our results demonstrate that sensitive imaging observations can now detect and characterize emission (and absorption) from the cosmic web of intergalactic and circumgalactic gas (and dust).</description>

      <title>3D projection analysis: characterizing the morphological stability of nearby open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The study of open cluster morphology is pivotal for exploring their formation and evolutionary processes. Aims. We manage to assess the morphological stability of 105 nearby open clusters within tidal radii on the X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes of the heliocentric Cartesian coordinate system, utilizing member catalogs from the literature. Meanwhile, we also delve into factors potentially impacting the clusters' morphological stability on these projection planes. Methods. We used the rose diagram method by constructing the 3D projected morphology of sample clusters to quantify the morphological stability of their 3D projected morphology. Results. Our analysis indicates there is a demonstrated linear positive correlation between the number of sample clusters' member stars within tidal radii and their morphological stability in different 3D projection planes. This may suggest that the more member stars there are within the tidal radius of a cluster, the stronger its own gravitational binding capacity is, resulting in strong morphological stability. We find a direct link between the clusters' morphological stabilities in the X-Z plane within tidal radii and their velocity dispersion in the same plane, suggesting that the morphological stabilities in the X-Z plane may be dependent on internal dynamics. Moreover, the morphological stability of the clusters' 3D projection is influenced by their spatial positions along the Y axis, but not linearly, indicating that the environmental changes at the clusters' location may affect their morphological stability. Likewise, specific external forces can have an effect on their morphological stability. Conclusions. This research introduces a novel perspective for understanding the morphological stability of open clusters, with a particular focus on their 3D projected morphologies.</description>

      <title>A catalogue of complex radio sources in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey created using a Self-Organising Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generations of radio surveys are expected to identify tens of millions of new sources, and identifying and classifying their morphologies will require novel and more efficient methods. Self-Organising Maps (SOMs), a type of unsupervised machine learning, can be used to address this problem. We map 251,259 multi-Gaussian sources from Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) onto a SOM with discrete neurons. Similarity metrics, such as Euclidean distances, can be used to identify the best-matching neuron or unit (BMU) for each input image. We establish a reliability threshold by visually inspecting a subset of input images and their corresponding BMU. We label the individual neurons based on observed morphologies and these labels are included in our value-added catalogue of RACS sources. Sources for which the Euclidean distance to their BMU is $\lesssim$ 5 (accounting for approximately 79$\%$ of sources) have an estimated $&gt;90\%$ reliability for their SOM-derived morphological labels. This reliability falls to less than 70$\%$ at Euclidean distances $\gtrsim$ 7. Beyond this threshold it is unlikely that the morphological label will accurately describe a given source. Our catalogue of complex radio sources from RACS with their SOM-derived morphological labels from this work will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scales of Galaxies from Self-interacting Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the characteristic scales for physical quantities of galaxies, such as mass, size, acceleration, and angular momentum, within the self-interacting ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model. Due to the small mass of ULDM, even minor self-interactions can drastically alter these scales in the Thomas-Fermi limit. Even in this limit, the characteristic mass can be determined by quantum pressure rather than by repulsive forces. We suggest that these characteristic scales are connected to certain mysteries of observed galaxies such as the universal acceleration scale or the constant surface density of galaxies. Oscillation of ULDM field can explain the current cosmological density of dark matter. Many cosmological constraints imply the energy scale $\tilde{m}$ of order of $10~eV$ and a GUT scale phase transition related to ULDM.</description>

      <title>Transient Blurring of the Scintillation Arc of Pulsar B1737+13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many pulsars, the scattering structures responsible for scintillation are typically dominated by a single, thin screen along the line of sight, which persists for years or decades. In recent years, an increasing number of doubly-lensed events have been observed, where a secondary lens crosses the line of sight. This causes additional or distorted scintillation arcs over time scales ranging from days to months. In this work we report such a transient event for pulsar B1737+13 and propose a possible lensing geometry including the distance to both lenses, and the orientation of the main screen. Using phase retrieval techniques to separate the two lenses in the wavefield, we report a curvature and rate of motion of features associated with the secondary lens as it passed through the line of sight. By fitting the annual variation of the curvature, we report a possible distance and orientation for the main screen. The distance of the secondary lens is found by mapping the secondary feature onto the sky and tracking its position over time for different distances. We validate this method using B0834+06, for which the screen solutions are known through VLBI, and successfully recover the correct solution for the secondary feature. With the identified lensing geometry, we are able to estimate the size of the secondary lens, 1 - 3 au. Although this an appropriate size for a structure that could cause an extreme scattering event, we do not have conclusive evidence for or against that possibility.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-1609Lb: Sub-jovian planet orbiting a low-mass stellar or brown dwarf host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.</description>

      <title>The Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha PlanetS (MISHAPS) I: Preliminary Constraints on the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first generation of transiting planet searches in globular clusters yielded no detections, and in hindsight, only placed occurrence rate limits slightly higher than the measured occurrence rate in the higher-metallicity Galactic thick disk. To improve these limits, we present the first results of a new wide field search for transiting hot Jupiters in the globular cluster 47~Tucanae. We have observed 47~Tuc as part of the Multiband Imaging Survey for High-Alpha Planets (MISHAPS). Using 24 partial and full nights of observations taken with the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO, we perform a search on 19,930 stars in the outer regions of the cluster. Though we find no clear planet detections, by combining our result with the upper limit enabled by Gilliland et al.'s 2000 Hubble search for planets around an independent sample of 34,091 stars in the inner cluster, we place the strongest limit to date on hot Jupiters with periods of $0.8 \leq P \leq 8.3$ days and $0.5~R_{\rm Jup} \leq R_{\rm P} \leq 2.0~R_{\rm Jup}$ of $f_{\rm HJ} &lt; 0.11\%$, a factor of ${\sim}$4 below the occurrence rate in the \textit{Kepler} field. Our search found 35 transiting planet candidates, though we are ultimately able to rule out each without follow-up observations. We also found 4 eclipsing binaries, including 3 previously-uncataloged detached eclipsing binary stars.</description>

      <title>3 mm Spectroscopic Observations of Massive Star-Forming Regions with IRAM 30-m</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband spectroscopic observations with high sensitivity provide an unbiased way to detect emissions of molecules in space. We present deep observations from ~ 105.8 GHz to 113.6 GHz toward 50 Galactic massive star-forming regions using IRAM 30-m millimeter telescope, with noise levels ranging from 6 to 29 at frequency channel spacing of 195 kHz, which corresponds to ~ 0.54 km/s at 110 GHz. Totally, 27 molecular species have been identified, of which 16 are complex organic molecules. The related parameters, such as peak temperature, integrated intensity, and line width of the identified molecular lines were obtained. The line widths of the chemically related molecules show strong positive correlations, suggesting they likely originate from similar gases within star-forming regions. This work highlights the fundamental properties of the detected molecular lines and offers a valuable dataset for further studies on the astrochemical evolution of molecules in massive star-forming cores.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Systematic Planetary Nebulae Detection with the Census of the Local Universe Narrowband Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of a systematic planetary nebula (PN) search in the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) narrowband (H$\alpha$) survey that covers a considerably larger sky region of above declination $-20^\circ$ than most previous surveys. Using PNe observed by the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (IPHAS) as validation, we are able to visually recover 432 out of 441 cataloged PNe (98\%) within the CLU dataset, with 5 sources having unusable CLU images and 4 missed due to limitations of imaging quality. Moreover, the reference PNe are conventionally divided into three PN classes in decreasing order of identification confidence given their spectra and morphologies. We record consistently high recovery rate across all classes: 95\% of True, 71\% of Likely, and 81\% of Possible sources are readily recovered. To further demonstrate the ability of CLU to find new PNe, we undertake a preliminary search of compact PNe within a sub-region of the validation catalog, mainly utilizing the significance of narrow-band colors ($\Sigma$) as a metric for identification. In a $200\,\rm deg^2$ region, we search the CLU source catalog and find 31 PN candidates after automated and visual scrutiny, of which 12 are new sources not appearing in previous studies. As a demonstration of our ongoing follow-up campaign, we present medium-resolution optical spectra of six candidates and notice that four of them show emission signatures characteristic of confirmed PNe. As we refine our selection methods, CLU promises to provide a systematic catalog of PNe spanning $2/3$ of the sky.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: The relationship between the shock and splashback radii of simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters reveal shocks associated with gas accretion from the cosmic web. Previous work based on non-radiative cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have defined the shock radius, $r_\text{shock}$, using the ICM entropy, $K \propto T/{n_\mathrm{e}}^{2/3}$, where $T$ and $n_\text{e}$ are the ICM temperature and electron density respectively; the $r_\text{shock}$ is identified with either the radius at which $K$ is a maximum or at which its logarithmic slope is a minimum. We investigate the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$, which is driven by gravitational hydrodynamics and shocks, and the splashback radius, $r_\text{splash}$, which is driven by the gravitational dynamics of cluster stars and dark matter and is measured from their mass profile. Using 324 clusters from {\small The Three Hundred} project of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, we quantify statistically how $r_\text{shock}$ relates to $r_\text{splash}$. Depending on our definition, we find that the median $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.38 r_\text{splash} (2.58 R_{200})$ when $K$ reaches its maximum and $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.91 r_\text{splash} (3.54 R_{200})$ when its logarithmic slope is a minimum; the best-fit linear relation increases as $r_\text{shock} \propto 0.65 r_\text{splash}$. We find that $r_\text{shock}/R_{200}$ and $r_\text{splash}/R_{200}$ anti-correlate with virial mass, $M_{200}$, and recent mass accretion history, and $r_\text{shock}/r_\text{splash}$ tends to be larger for clusters with higher recent accretion rates. We discuss prospects for measuring $r_\text{shock}$ observationally and how the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$ and $r_\text{splash}$ can be used to improve constraints from radio, X-ray, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys that target the interface between the cosmic web and clusters.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at https://github.com/calab-ntu/fdm-soliton-halo-relation.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.</description>

      <title>Recovering Pulsar Braking Index from a Population of Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The braking index, $n$, of a pulsar is a measure of its angular momentum loss and the value it takes corresponds to different spin-down mechanisms. For a pulsar spinning down due to gravitational wave emission from the principal mass quadrupole mode alone, the braking index would equal exactly 5. Unfortunately, for millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the extremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\ddot{f}$. This paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the distribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the values individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47 millisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian inference methods. We find that while possible, observation times of over 20 years and RMS noise of the order of $10^{-5}$ ms are needed, which can be compared to the mean noise value of $3\times10^{-4}$ ms for the recent wideband 12.5-year NANOGrav sample, which provided the pulsar timing data used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary discs around sun-like stars appear to live longer when the metallicity is low</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of a 282 $^{+34}_{-31}$ pc-sized core in the center of Milky Way dark matter halo at $68\%$ confidence level by using the micro-lensing event rate sky map data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We apply the spacial information of the microlensing sky map and model it with the detailed Milky Way dark matter halo Core/Cusp profile, and the fraction of dark matter in the form of Mini Dark Matter Structure (MDMS, $f_{\rm MDMS}=\Omega_{\rm MDMS}/\Omega_{\rm DM}$), e.g. primordial black hole, earth-mass subhalos, floating planets and so on. We find that this sky map can constrain both $f_{\rm MDMS}$ and the core size simultaneously without strong degeneracy while fully considering mass function of Milky Way stellar components from both the bulge and disk.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: A high number of dual AGN at z~3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Exploring faint white dwarfs and the luminosity function with Subaru HSC and SDSS in Stripe 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 5,080 white dwarf (WD) candidates selected from stars matching between the multi-band imaging datasets of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the Stripe82 region covering about 165~deg$^2$. We select WD candidates from the ``reduced proper motion'' diagram by combining the apparent magnitude in the range $i=19$ -- 24 and the proper motion measured from the datasets among a baseline of $\sim$ 14~years. We refine the WD candidates by fitting blackbody and template WD atmosphere models to HSC photometries for each candidate, enabling the estimation of distance and tangential velocity ($v_{\rm t}$). The deep HSC data allow us to identify low-temperature ($&lt;4000$~K) and faint WD candidates down to absolute magnitude, $M_{\rm bol}\simeq 17$. We evaluate the selection function of our WD candidates using a mock catalogue of spatial and kinematic distributions of WDs in the (thin and thick) disc and halo regions based on a Galactic model. We construct samples of disc and halo WD candidates by selecting WDs with tangential velocity, $40&lt;v_{\rm t}/[{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}]&lt;80$ and $200&lt;v_{\rm t}/[{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}]&lt;500$, respectively. The total number densities of the disc and halo WDs are $(9.33 \pm 0.89) \times 10^{-3}$~pc$^{-3}$ and $(6.34 \pm 2.90) \times 10^{-4}$~pc$^{-3}$. Our luminosity functions (LF) extend down to fainter absolute magnitudes compared with previous work. The faint WDs could represent the oldest generation of building blocks over the past $\sim$10 billion years of the assembly history of our Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Final results for mapping the Milky Way's stellar halo with blue horizontal-branch stars selected from the Subaru Hyper Supreme-Cam Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We select blue-horizontal branch stars (BHBs) from the internal data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program to reveal the global structure of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo. The data are distributed over $\sim 1,100$~deg$^2$ area in the range of $18.5&lt;g&lt;24.5$~mag, so that candidate BHBs are detectable over a Galactocentric radius of $r \simeq 36-575$~kpc. In order to select most likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars and other contaminants in a statistically significant manner, we develop and apply an extensive Bayesian method, as described in \citet{Fukushima2019}. Our sample can be fitted to either a single power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=4.11^{+0.18}_{-0.18}$ or a broken power-law profile with an index of $\alpha_{\rm in}=3.90^{+0.24}_{-0.30}$ at $r$ below a broken radius of $r_{\rm b}=184^{+118}_{-66}$ kpc and a very steep slope of $\alpha_{\rm out}=9.1^{+6.8}_{-3.6}$ at $r&gt;r_{\rm b}$; the statistical difference between these fitting profiles is small. Both profiles are found to show prolate shapes having axial ratios of $q=1.47^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$ and $1.56^{+0.34}_{-0.23}$, respectively. We also find a signature of the so-called "splashback radius" for the candidate BHBs, which can reach as large as $r \sim 575$~kpc, although it is still inconclusive owing to rather large distance errors in this faintest end of the sample. Our results suggest that the MW stellar halo consists of the two overlapping components: the {\it in situ} inner halo showing a relatively steep radial density profile and the {\it ex situ} outer halo with a shallower profile, being characteristic of a component formed from accretion of small stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry: Revisiting the Mass-Metallicity Relation with JWST/NIRSpec at 4 &lt; z &lt; 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present star formation rates (SFR), the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), and the SFR-dependent MZR across redshifts 4 to 10 using 81 star-forming galaxies observed by the JWST NIRSpec employing both low-resolution PRISM and medium-resolution gratings, including galaxies from the JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields, the JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey, and additional galaxies from the literature in Abell 2744, SMACS-0723, RXJ2129, BDF, COSMOS, and MACS1149 fields. These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of $10^7 &lt; M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{10}$, with an average SFR of $7.2 \pm 1.2 M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an average metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \pm 0.08$. Our findings align with previous observations up to $z=8$ for the MZR and indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond $z=8$, we observe a significant deviation $\sim 0.27$ dex) in FMR, consistent with recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47 galaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in a combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend with a slope of $0.067 \pm 0.013$, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but contradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical mass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-$z$ relation): $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237 \times{\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) - 0.06 \times (1+z)$, which accurately reproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar mass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the factors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow, outflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: Metallicity Gradients in Galaxies at $z\sim1$ with JWST/NIRSpec Slit-stepping Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radial gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a powerful probe of the chemical and structural evolution of star-forming galaxies, closely tied to disk formation and gas kinematics in the early universe. We present spatially resolved chemical and dynamical properties for a sample of 25 galaxies at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.7$ from the \msasd survey. These innovative observations provide 3D spectroscopy of galaxies at a spatial resolution approaching JWST's diffraction limit and a high spectral resolution of $R\simeq2700$. The metallicity gradients measured in our galaxy sample range from $-$0.03 to 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Most galaxies exhibit negative or flat radial gradients, indicating lower metallicity in the outskirts or uniform metallicity throughout the entire galaxy. We confirm a tight relationship between stellar mass and metallicity gradient at $z\sim1$ with small intrinsic scatter of 0.02 dex~kpc$^{-1}$. Our results indicate that metallicity gradients become increasingly negative as stellar mass increases, likely because the more massive galaxies tend to be more ``disky". This relationship is consistent with the predictions from cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with strong stellar feedback. This work presents the effort to harness the multiplexing capability of JWST NIRSpec/MSA in slit-stepping mode to map the chemical and kinematic profiles of high-redshift galaxies in large samples and at high spatial and spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>A grand-design spiral galaxy with an ordered magnetic field at redshift 2.6 as resolved with ALMA and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play an important role in the evolution of galaxies and in shaping the dynamics of their inter-stellar medium. However, the formation history of magnetic fields from initial seed-fields to well-ordered systems is not clear. Favoured scenarios include a turbulent dynamo that amplifies the field, and a mean-field dynamo that organizes it. Such a model can be tested through observing the magnetic-field structure of galaxies in the early Universe given the relative formation time-scales involved. Here, we combine the high angular resolution of the Atacama Large Milli-metre Array (ALMA) and gravitational lensing to resolve the magnetic field structure of a 4-kpc in extent grand-design spiral when the Universe was just 2.6 Gyr old. We find that the spiral arm structure, as traced by the heated dust emission, is coincident with the linearly polarized emission, which is consistent with a highly ordered magnetic field. The time-scale needed to produce such an ordered field is likely within at least several rotations of the disk. Our study highlights the importance of combining the long baselines of ALMA and gravitational lensing to resolve the structure of galaxies at cosmologically interesting epochs.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity effects on the supermassive black hole gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We developed a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity is relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We found that when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal preferred highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects were included, the initial eccentricity could be significantly lowered, yet the scenario with purely circular binaries was still mildly disfavored.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength picture of the misaligned BL Lac object 3C 371</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 is one of the targets that are regularly monitored by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration to study blazar variability on both short and long timescales. We aim to evaluate the long-term multiwavelength (MWL) behaviour of 3C 371, comparing it with the results derived for its optical emission in our previous study. For this, we make use of the multi-band campaigns organized by the WEBT Collaboration in optical and radio between January 2018 and December 2020, and of public data from Swift and Fermi satellites and the MOJAVE Very Large Interferometry programme. We evaluate the variability shown by the source in each band with the amplitude variability quantification, as well as possible interband correlation using the z-Discrete Correlation Function. We also present a deep analysis of the optical-UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral variability. With the MOJAVE data we perform a kinematics analysis, looking for components propagating along the jet, calculating its kinematics parameters. This set of parameters is later used for the interpretation of the source MWL behaviour, modelling the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with theoretical blazar emission scenarios.</description>
