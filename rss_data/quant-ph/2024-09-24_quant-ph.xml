      <title>Quantum states and quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical theory, the physical systems are elucidated through the concepts of particles and waves, which aim to describe the reality of the physical system with certainty. In this framework, particles are mathematically represented by position vectors as functions of time, $\vec{x}(t)$, while waves are modeled by tensor fields in space-time, $\Phi(t, \vec{x})$. These functions are embedded in, and evolve within space-time. All information about the physical system are coded in these mathematical functions, upon which the classical technologies are developed. In contrast, quantum theory models the physical system using a quantum state $\vert \alpha ,t\rangle$, situated in an evolving within Hilbert space, portraying the system's reality with inherent uncertainty. Despite the probabilistic nature of reality observation, the quantum state $\vert \alpha ,t\rangle$ can be precisely determined due to the unitary principle, provided we know the initial state. Therefore, it can serve as a foundation for developing quantum technologies, which we call quantum state-tronics similar to electronics. This discussion focuses on quantum computation, given its expansive scope. One of the paramount challenges in quantum computing is the scarcity of individuals equipped with the requisite knowledge of quantum field theory and the training necessary for this field. This article aims to elucidate the fundamental concepts of quantum field theory and their interconnections with quantum computing, striving to simplify them for those engaged in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Towards violations of Local Friendliness with quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local Friendliness (LF) inequalities follow from seemingly reasonable assumptions about reality: (i) ``absoluteness of observed events'' (e.g., every observed event happens for all observers) and (ii) ``local agency'' (e.g., free choices can be made uncorrelated with other events outside their future light cone). Extended Wigner's Friend Scenario (EWFS) thought experiments show that textbook quantum mechanics violates these inequalities. Thus, experimental evidence of these violations would make these two assumptions incompatible. In [Nature Physics 16, 1199 (2020)], the authors experimentally implemented an EWFS, using a photonic qubit to play the role of each of the ``friends'' and measured violations of LF. One may question whether a photonic qubit is a physical system that counts as an ``observer'' and thereby question whether the experiment's outcome is significant. Intending to measure increasingly meaningful violations, we propose using a statistical measure called the ``branch factor'' to quantify the ``observerness'' of the system. We then encode the EWFS as a quantum circuit such that the components of the circuit that define the friend are quantum systems of increasing branch factor. We run this circuit on quantum simulators and hardware devices, observing LF violations as the system sizes scale. As errors in quantum computers reduce the significance of the violations, better quantum computers can produce better violations. Our results extend the state of the art in proof-of-concept experimental violations from branch factor 0.0 to branch factor 16.0. This is an initial result in an experimental program for measuring LF violations at increasingly meaningful branch factors using increasingly more powerful quantum processors and networks. We introduce this program as a fundamental science application for near-term and developing quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Diagonalization of Mechanical Quantities and the EPR Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closure relation of quantum mechanical projection operators is not entirely true; it can be strictly falsified under unitary transformations in Fock states. The angular momentum $J_x$, $J_y$ and $J_z$ are simultaneously diagonalized under the orthonormal set $\{|\phi_n\rangle\}$ of continuous rotation transformations in Fock states. $\{|\phi_n\rangle\}$'s time reversal $\{ \mathcal{T} |\phi_n\rangle \}$ is the zero point of coordinates q and momentum p, and its arbitrary translation transformation $\{ \mathcal{D} \mathcal{T} |\phi_n\rangle \}$ diagonalizes both coordinates and momentum simultaneously. The abstract representation of the Dirac state vector implies the symmetry breaking of the non-Abelian group unit matrix $\{ \mathcal{U}^ \mathcal{H} \mathcal{U} \neq \mathcal{U} \mathcal{U} ^\mathcal{H} \}$. The EPR paradox is merely a fallacy under the reversible diagonalization of physical reality, it is resolved under irreversible diagonalization.</description>

      <title>FOCQS: Feedback Optimally Controlled Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization, both for classical and quantum functions, is one of the most well-studied applications of quantum computing, but recent trends have relied on hybrid methods that push much of the fine-tuning off onto costly classical algorithms. Feedback-based quantum algorithms, such as FALQON, avoid these fine-tuning problems but at the cost of additional circuit depth and a lack of convergence guarantees. In this work, we take the local greedy information collected by Lyapunov feedback control and develop an analytic framework to use it to perturbatively update previous control layers, similar to the global optimal control achievable using Pontryagin optimal control. This perturbative methodology, which we call Feedback Optimally Controlled Quantum States (FOCQS), can be used to improve the results of feedback-based algorithms, like FALQON. Furthermore, this perturbative method can be used to push smooth annealing-like control protocol closer to the control optimum, even providing and iterative approach, albeit with diminishing returns. In numerical testing, we show improvements in convergence and required depth due to these methods over existing quantum feedback control methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Optimization for Enhanced Adiabatic State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of non-trivial states is crucial to the study of quantum many-body physics. Such states can be prepared with adiabatic quantum algorithms, which are restricted by the minimum spectral gap along the path. In this letter, we propose an efficient method to adiabatically prepare tensor networks states (TNSs). We maximize the spectral gap leveraging degrees of freedom in the parent Hamiltonian construction. We demonstrate this efficient adiabatic algorithm for preparing TNS, through examples of random TNS in one dimension, AKLT, and GHZ states. The Hamiltonian optimization applies to both injective and non-injective tensors, in the latter case by exploiting symmetries present in the tensors.</description>

      <title>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Atom Arrays in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) enables the control of light-matter interactions at the single-photon level, rendering it a key component of many quantum technologies. Its practical realization, however, is complex since it involves placing individual quantum emitters close to mirror surfaces within a high-finesse cavity. In this work, we propose a cavity QED architecture fully based on atoms trapped in free space. In particular, we show that a pair of two-dimensional, ordered arrays of atoms can be described by conventional cavity QED parameters. Such an atom-array cavity exhibits the same cooperativity as a conventional counterpart with matching mirror specifications even though the cavity coupling strength and decay rate are modified by the narrow bandwidth of the atoms. We estimate that an array cavity composed of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in an optical lattice can reach a cooperativity of about $10$. This value can be increased suppressing atomic motion with larger trap depths and may exceed $10^4$ with an ideal placement of the atoms. To reduce the experimental complexity of our scheme, we propose a spatially dependent AC Stark shift as an alternative to curving the arrays, which may be of independent interest. In addition to presenting a promising platform for cavity QED, our work creates opportunities for exploring novel phenomena based on the intrinsic nonlinearity of atom arrays and the possibility to dynamically control them.</description>

      <title>Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Single Quadrature Measurement at Arbitrary Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simplified measurement scheme for a Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) protocol for continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), utilizing homodyne detection without quadrature switching. The reference frame of measurement is taken to be at an arbitrary angle, however, reconciliation converges the proposed scheme to GMCS with switching quadrature protocol (GG02). The arbitrary frame of measurement could also include the unknown random thermal drift within Bob's optical measurement setup. We found this scheme is advantageous for practical free-space and fibre-based GMCS protocol based CVQKD systems as it does not require a phase modulator for random measurement selection quadrature at Bob.</description>

      <title>Oracle problems as communication tasks and optimization of quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity mainly studies the number of queries needed to learn some property of a black box with high probability. A closely related question is how well an algorithm can succeed with this learning task using only a fixed number of queries. In this work, we propose measuring an algorithm's performance using the mutual information between the output and the actual value. A key observation is that if an algorithm is only allowed to make a single query and the goal is to optimize this mutual information, then we obtain a task which is similar to a basic task of quantum communication, where one attempts to maximize the mutual information of the sender and receiver. We make this analogy precise by formally considering the oracle as a separate subsystem, whose state records the unknown oracle identity. The oracle query prepares a state, which is then measured; and the target property of the oracle plays the role of a message that should be deduced from the measurement outcome. Thus we obtain a link between the optimal single-query algorithm and minimization of the extent of quantum correlations between the oracle and the computer subsystems. We also find a lower bound on this mutual information, which is related to quantum coherence. These results extend to multiple-query non-adaptive algorithms. As a result, we gain insight into the task of finding the optimal non-adaptive algorithm that uses at most a fixed number of queries, for any oracle problem.</description>

      <title>About the role of short and long trajectories on the quantum optical state after high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) involves the up-conversion of a high-intensity driving field into its harmonic orders. This process is intrinsically non-classical, requiring from quantum mechanics for a complete explanation as, under suitable conditions, involves phenomena such as particle tunneling through a potential barrier. When exposed to a high-intensity, low-frequency laser field, bound electrons ionize via tunneling, accelerate under the driving field, and recombine with the parent ion, emitting high-harmonic radiation. However, electrons can follow two distinct pathways -- short and long trajectories -- during these steps. In this work, we evaluate the signatures left by these trajectories on the quantum optical state after HHG, and observe that they lead to entanglement between the driving field and the generated harmonics. By leveraging these correlations, we use harmonic generation to herald the creation of optical Schr\"odinger cat-like states in the driving field. Additionally, using an ab-initio approach, we examine how propagation effects, which spatially separate the harmonic contributions from short and long trajectories, influence the non-classical characteristics of the emitted light.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transfer of a Rydberg W-state to a multi-mode photonic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust quantum protocol has been developed that achieves highly efficient entanglement transfer from a three-atom Rydberg system, initially in a W state (|rrg&gt;+|rgr&gt;+|grr&gt;)/3^0.5, to an equivalent photonic W state (|101&gt;+|110&gt;+|011&gt;)/3^0.5. The entanglement transfer is achieved by dynamically adjusting the cavity mode frequencies and modulating the coupling rates, simplifying the complex transfer process into a sequence of processes involving two-level avoided crossings. We demonstrate that entanglement transfer can be achieved using either a fully adiabatic protocol or one with controlled non-adiabatic transitions at avoided crossings, generated by continuously chirping the cavity modes. Our adiabatic protocol uses the fractional STIRAP method to facilitate the partial population transfer required for generation of the photonic W state. In comparison, the non-adiabatic protocol uses non-adiabatic transitions to achieve the required partial population transfer. Furthermore, we propose two strategies for experimental implementation of our protocols.</description>

      <title>Ultrabright fiber-coupled ploarization-entangled photon source with spectral brightness surpassing 2.0 MHz/mW/nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ultrabright polarization-entangled photon source that is optimally coupled into single-mode fibers (SMFs). This study theoretically and experimentally examines the characteristics of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photons, including their spectrum, bandwidth, emission angle, and intensity, as functions of crystal length, temperature and beam waist condition. Notably, we measure the collinear spatial modes of photon-pairs and collection optics under various beam waist conditions and analyze them using a collinear Gaussian approximation model. By employing a simple mode-matching optical setup, we optimize the SMF coupling and heralding efficiencies of the photon-pairs. Consequently, we achieve a spectral brightness exceeding 2.0 MHz/mW/nm from a fiber-coupled entangled photon source, utilizing a 30-mm ppKTP crystal inside a polarization Sagnac interferometer. This represents the highest spectral brightness of SPDC photons generated using a CW laser pumped bulk crystal to date. Polarization entanglement was verified by a quantum state tomography and a polarization-correlation measurement. The fidelity of the entangled state is measured to be 97.8 % and the Bell-CHSH value S = 2.782 +- 0.04. The results obtained here provide practical insights for designing high-performance SPDC sources for satellite-based communication and long-distance optical links with extremely high-photon loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Optimized Nonadiabatic Holonomic Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) is one of the promising approaches to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, due to the imperfect control in the experimental environments, the holonomic gate still needs to be further improved. Here, we propose a dynamically optimized NHQC (OPNHQC) scheme based on dynamically corrected gate technique. The scheme is implemented by carefully designing a sequence of elementary pulses to fulfill cyclic evolution, while the dynamical phase is not accumulated. In this way, the constructed holonomic gate is immune to the error. It is found that our scheme can correct the $X$ error up to fourth order. In addition, combining with the DFS encoding our scheme can be immune to both the $X$ and $Z$ errors. Therefore, our proposed scheme offers a prospective way to the realization of scalable fault-tolerant holonomic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Multiseed Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is an attractive measure for the rate at which quantum operators spread in the space of all possible operators under dynamical evolution. One expects that its late-time plateau would distinguish between integrable and chaotic dynamics, but its ability to do so depends precariously on the choice of the initial seed. We propose to apply such considerations not to a single operator, but simultaneously to a collection of initial seeds in the manner of the block Lanczos algorithm. We furthermore suggest that this collection should comprise all simple (few-body) operators in the theory, which echoes the applications of Nielsen complexity to dynamical evolution. The resulting construction, unlike the conventional Krylov complexity, reliably distinguishes integrable and chaotic Hamiltonians without any need for fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Quantum DeepONet: Neural operators accelerated by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of computational science and engineering, constructing models that reflect real-world phenomena requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with different conditions. Recent advancements in neural operators, such as deep operator network (DeepONet), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, promise efficient computation of PDE solutions for a new condition in a single forward pass. However, classical DeepONet entails quadratic complexity concerning input dimensions during evaluation. Given the progress in quantum algorithms and hardware, here we propose to utilize quantum computing to accelerate DeepONet evaluations, yielding complexity that is linear in input dimensions. Our proposed quantum DeepONet integrates unary encoding and orthogonal quantum layers. We benchmark our quantum DeepONet using a variety of PDEs, including the antiderivative operator, advection equation, and Burgers' equation. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in both ideal and noisy conditions. Furthermore, we show that our quantum DeepONet can also be informed by physics, minimizing its reliance on extensive data collection. Quantum DeepONet will be particularly advantageous in applications in outer loop problems which require to explore parameter space and solving the corresponding PDEs, such as uncertainty quantification and optimal experimental design.</description>

      <title>Optimization of partially isolated quantum harmonic oscillator memory systems by mean square decoherence time criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum harmonic oscillators with position-momentum system variables, whose internal dynamics and interaction with the environment are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. A recently proposed approach to such systems as Heisenberg picture quantum memories exploits their ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a decoherence horizon. Using the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values, we apply this approach to a partially isolated subsystem of the oscillator, which is not directly affected by the external fields. The partial isolation leads to an appropriate system decomposition and a qualitatively different short-horizon asymptotic behaviour of the deviation, which yields a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit. The resulting approximate decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters for improving the quantum memory performance is discussed for a coherent feedback interconnection of such systems.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Dynamical Decoupling for (Almost) Any Spin-Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a technique aimed at suppressing the interaction between a quantum system and its environment by applying frequent unitary operations on the system alone. In the present paper, we analytically study the dynamical decoupling of a two-level system coupled with a structured bosonic environment initially prepared in a thermal state. We find sufficient conditions under which dynamical decoupling works for such systems, and, most importantly, we find bounds for the convergence speed of the procedure. Our analysis is based on a new Trotter theorem for multiple Hamiltonians and involves a rigorous treatment of the evolution of mixed quantum states via unbounded Hamiltonians. A comparison with numerical experiments shows that our bounds reproduce the correct scaling in various relevant system parameters. Furthermore, our analytical treatment allows for quantifying the decoupling efficiency for boson baths with infinitely many modes, in which case a numerical treatment is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Curve-Fitted QPE: Extending Quantum Phase Estimation Results for a Higher Precision using Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation is a crucial component of several front-running quantum algorithms. Improving the efficiency and accuracy of QPE is currently a very active field of research. In this work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that consists of the standard QPE circuit and classical post-processing using curve-fitting, where special attention is given to the latter. We show that our approach achieves high precision with optimal Cram\'er-Rao lower bound performance and is comparable in error resolution with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Maximum Likelihood Amplitude Estimation algorithms. Our method could potentially be further extended to the case of estimating multiple phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum systems coupled to environments via mean field interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when a quantum system is coupled to an environment in a mean field way, then its effective dynamics is governed by a unitary group with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The time-dependent modification of the bare system Hamiltonian is given by an explicit term involving the reservoir state. We show that entanglement within the system state is not changed during the dynamics. Our results hold for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment coupling, and for finite or infinite dimensional systems. As an application we show that the qualitative dynamical features of an $N$-body system can be altered drastically by the contact with the environment. For instance, bound states can turn into scattering states and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>Solving Max-3SAT Using QUBO Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As contemporary quantum computers do not possess error correction, any calculation performed by these devices can be considered an involuntary approximation. To solve a problem on a quantum annealer, it has to be expressed as an instance of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). In this work, we thus study whether systematically approximating QUBO representations of the MAX-3SAT problem can improve the solution quality when solved on contemporary quantum hardware, compared to using exact, non-approximated QUBO representations. For a MAX-3SAT instance consisting of a 3SAT formula with n variables and m clauses, we propose a method of systematically creating approximate QUBO representations of dimension (n x n), which is significantly smaller than the QUBO matrices of any exact, non-approximated MAX-3SAT QUBO transformation. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that using our QUBO approximations for solving MAX-3SAT problems on D-Wave's quantum annealer Advantage_System6.4 can yield better results than using state-of-the-art exact QUBO transformations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using naive QUBO approximation methods, based on removing values from exact (n+m)x(n+m)-dimensional QUBO representations of MAX-3SAT instances is ineffective.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Quantum Annealing with Engineered Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the insight that engineered noise, specifically, engineered dephasing can enhance the adiabaticity of controlled quantum dynamics, we investigate how a dephasing-generating coupling to an auxiliary quantum system affects quantum annealing protocols. By calculating the exact reduced system dynamics, we show how this coupling enhances the system's adiabaticity solely through a coherent mechanism - an effective energy rescaling. We show that it can lead to an annealing speedup linearly proportional to the strength of the coupling. We discuss the experimental feasibility of the protocols, and investigate the trade-off between fidelity and implementability by examining two modified versions with fewer types of required physical couplings.</description>

      <title>Measuring Correlation and Entanglement between Molecular Orbitals on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying correlation and entanglement between molecular orbitals can elucidate the role of quantum effects in strongly correlated reaction processes. However, accurately storing the wavefunction for a classical computation of those quantities can be prohibitive. Here we use the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer to calculate von Neumann entropies which quantify the orbital correlation and entanglement in a strongly correlated molecular system relevant to lithium-ion batteries (vinylene carbonate interacting with an O$_2$ molecule). As shown in previous works, fermionic superselection rules decrease correlations and reduce measurement overheads for constructing orbital reduced density matrices. Taking into account superselection rules we further reduce the number of measurements by finding commuting sets of Pauli operators. Using low overhead noise reduction techniques we calculate von Neumann entropies in excellent agreement with noiseless benchmarks, indicating that correlations and entanglement between molecular orbitals can be accurately estimated from a quantum computation. Our results show that the one-orbital entanglement vanishes unless opposite-spin open shell configurations are present in the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>The Separability Problem in Quantum Mechanics: Insights from Research on Axiomatics and Human Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's article on the EPR paradox is the most cited of his works, but not many know that it was not fully representative of the way he thought about the incompleteness of the quantum formalism. Indeed, his main worry was not Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which he accepted, but the experimental non-separability of spatially separate systems. The same problem was also recognized, years later, by one of us, as part of an axiomatic analysis of the quantum formalism, which revealed an unexpected structural limitation of the quantum formalism in Hilbert space, preventing the description of separate systems. As we will explain, this limitation does not manifest at the level of the states, but of the projectors describing the properties, in the sense that there are not enough properties in the formalism to describe separate systems. The question remains whether separability is a possibility at the fundamental level and if a formalism should integrate it into its mathematical structure, as a possibility. To aid our intuition, we offer a reflection based on a powerful analogy between physical systems and human conceptual entities, as the question of separability also arises for the latter.</description>

      <title>Thermalization without detailed balance: population oscillations in the absence of coherences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that comply with detailed balance exponentially decay to thermal equilibrium. Beyond the weak coupling limit, systems that break microreversibility (e.g., in the presence of magnetic fields) violate detailed balance but still thermalize. We study the thermalization of these systems and show that a temperature rise produces novel exceptional points that indicate a sharp transition in the thermalization dynamics. A further temperature increase fuels oscillations of the energy level populations even without quantum coherences. Moreover, the violation of detailed balance introduces an energy scale that characterizes the oscillatory regime at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Comparing on-off detector and single photon detector in photon subtraction based continuous variable quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider here two distinct photon detectors namely, single photon detector and on-off detector, to implement photon subtraction on a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. The two distinct photon subtracted TMSV states generated are utilized individually as resource states in continuous variable quantum teleportation. Owing to the fact that the two generated states have different success probabilities (of photon subtraction) and fidelities (of quantum teleportation), we consider the product of the success probability and fidelity enhancement as a figure of merit for the comparison of the two detectors. The results show that the single photon detector should be preferred over the on-off detector for the maximization of the considered figure of merit.</description>

      <title>Effect of Etching Methods on Dielectric Losses in Transmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are considered as a promising platform for implementing a fault tolerant quantum computing. However, surface defects of superconductors and the substrate leading to qubit state decoherence and fluctuations in qubit parameters constitute a significant problem. The amount and type of defects depend both on the chip materials and fabrication procedure. In this work, transmons produced by two different methods of aluminum etching: wet etching in a solution of weak acids and dry etching using a chlorine-based plasma are experimentally studied. The relaxation and coherence times for dry-etched qubits are more than twice as long as those for wet-etched ones. Additionally, the analysis of time fluctuations of qubit frequencies and relaxation times, which is an effective method to identify the dominant dielectric loss mechanisms, indicates a significantly lower impact of two-level systems in the dry-etched qubits compared to the wet-etched ones.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we generalize the algebraic framework for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) in one-dimensional symmetry protected topological states recently developed in [Quantum 7, 1215 (2023)], such that in addition to half-odd-integer spins, the integer spin chains can also be incorporated in the framework. The computational order parameter characterizing the efficiency of MBQC is identified, which, for spin-$1$ chains in the Haldane phase, coincides with the conventional string order parameter in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Preparing Ground and Excited States Using Adiabatic CoVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoVarince Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced as a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches, such as variants of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, aim to optimise a non-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g., poor local minima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully exploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large number of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly scaling classical HPC compute resources. As a result, CoVaR has been demonstrated to be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main limitation has been that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We address this limitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target Hamiltonian and demonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR can successfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial warm start is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very small -- this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation algorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy gaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then adiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted specific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic CoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of a Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating thermal properties or in high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol that allows the estimation of any density matrix element for continuous-variable quantum states, without resorting to the complete reconstruction of the full density matrix. The algorithm adaptatively discretizes the state and then, by resorting to controlled squeezing and translation operations, which are the main requirements for this algorithm, measures the density matrix element value. Furthermore, we show how this method can be used to achieve full quantum state tomography for continuous-variable quantum systems, alongside numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Unique entanglement dynamics of two-qubit separable and Werner states in a discrete qubit environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how the entanglement dynamics of separable and Werner states differ in a finite Markovian N-qubit environment under two environmental conditions: homogeneous and white noise. We demonstrate that in a homogeneous environment, the entanglement dynamics of the separable state is influenced by interactions between subsystems $\omega_{S_1 S_2}$ and the environment $\Gamma$, while for Werner states it depends solely on $\Gamma$. Both states exhibit unique properties that enable us to distinguish the initial state through their entanglement dynamics and maximum concurrence. In contrast, in a white noise environment, the decay time of entanglement is determined only by the size of the environment and the randomness of interaction strengths, underscoring the significant role of environmental factors in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the BB84 protocol has provable security over a noiseless quantum channel, the security is not proven over current noisy technology. The level of tolerable error on such systems is still unclear, as is how much information about a raw key may be obtained by an eavesdropper. We develop a reproducible test to determine the security--or lack thereof--of the protocol in practice. This enables us to obtain an experimental estimate of the information that can be obtained using asymmetric phase-covariant cloning to eavesdrop on the BB84 protocol.</description>

Abstract: We develop an angular analysis based on the reconstruction of the helicity amplitudes from dedicated experimental data corresponding to the tripartite state composed by one qutrit and two qubits, which arises in the three-body decays of a spin zero particle into one vector and a fermion pair. Starting from the associated spin density matrix of the final state, entanglement quantifiers were investigated and the corresponding significances were determined up to second order in the error propagation of the uncertainties of the angular measurements. As an application of our analysis, we performed a full quantum tomography of the final state in the $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays using data recorded by LHCb collaboration. We found the presence of genuine quantum entanglement of the final state and also in both kaon-muon and di-muon subsystems. In recent years, $B$ meson decays received significant attention from both experimental and theoretical sides, and the proposed observables provide novel perspectives for studying them. Furthermore, this analysis could be also applied to other several processes if the complete experimental data were available for the helicity amplitudes reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Efficient excitation transfer in an LH2-inspired nanoscale stacked ring geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength ring-shaped structures of quantum emitters exhibit outstanding radiation properties and are useful for antennas, excitation transport, and storage. Taking inspiration from the oligomeric geometry of biological light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes, we study here generic examples and predict highly efficient excitation transfer in a three-dimensional (3D) subwavelength concentric stacked ring structure with a diameter of 400 \textit{nm}, formed by two-level atoms. Utilizing the quantum optical open system master equation approach for the collective dipole dynamics, we demonstrate that, depending on the system parameters, our bio-mimicked 3D ring enables efficient excitation transfer between two ring layers. Our findings open prospects for engineering other biomimetic light-matter platforms and emitter arrays to achieve efficient energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Quantum determinism and completeness restored by indistinguishability and long-time particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that measurement data in quantum physics can be rigorously interpreted only as a result of a statistical, macroscopic process, taking into account the indistinguishable character of identical particles. Quantum determinism is in principle possible on the condition that a fully-fledged quantum model is used to describe the measurement device in interaction with the studied object as one system. In contrast, any approach that relies on Born's rule discriminates the dynamics of a quantum system from that of the detector with which it interacts during measurement. In this work, we critically analyze the validity of this measurement postulate applied to single-event signals. In fact, the concept of ``individual'' particle becomes inadequate once both indistinguishability and a scattering approach allowing an unlimited interaction time for an effective detection, are considered as they should be, hence preventing the separability of two successive measurement events. In this context, measurement data should therefore be understood only as a result of statistics over many events. Accounting for the intrinsic noise of the sources and the detectors, we also show with the illustrative cases of the Schr\"odinger cat and the Bell experiment that once the Born rule is abandoned on the level of a single particle, realism, locality and causality are restored. We conclude that indiscernibility and long-time detection process make quantum physics not fundamentally probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Generalized conformal quantum mechanics as an ideal observer in two-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain an action for a generalized conformal mechanics (GCM) coupled to Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity from a double scaling limit of the motion of a charged massive particle in the near-horizon geometry of a near-extremal spherical black hole. When JT gravity is treated in the classical approximation, the backreaction of the particle's wavefunction on the time-reparametrization mode (and therefore the bulk metric) vanishes while the conformal symmetry in GCM is reparametrized in a state-dependent way. We also construct the semi-classical Hilbert space of the full theory by explicitly solving the general time-dependent normalizable solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for GCM, and show that the time-reparametrization mode can be inferred from the measurement of suitable observables. Since the full theory of the GCM coupled to JT gravity is amenable to quantization, it can lead to a solvable model for a detector coupled to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-interference-induced pairing in antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t$-$J$ model is investigated via large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations. In contrast to the competing orders in the fermionic $t$-$J$ model, we discover that a pair density wave (PDW) of tightly bound hole pairs coexists with the AFM order forming a ``supersolid'' at small doping in the bosonic model. The pairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson condensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order simultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum many-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry phase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this bosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern between spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped holes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM background. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes in an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the Bose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is inherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns caused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical mechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been recently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional pairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Entropic Fluctuations in Statistical Mechanics II. Quantum Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Evans-Searles, respectively Gallavotti-Cohen, fluctuation theorem concerns certain universal statistical features of the entropy production rate of a classical system in a transient, respectively steady, state. In this paper, we consider and compare several possible extensions of these fluctuation theorems to quantum systems. In addition to the direct two-time measurement approach whose discussion is based on (LMP 114:32 (2024)), we discuss a variant where measurements are performed indirectly on an auxiliary system called ancilla, and which allows to retrieve non-trivial statistical information using ancilla state tomography. We also show that modular theory provides a way to extend the classical notion of phase space contraction rate to the quantum domain, which leads to a third extension of the fluctuation theorems. We further discuss the quantum version of the principle of regular entropic fluctuations, introduced in the classical context in (Nonlinearity 24, 699 (2011)). Finally, we relate the statistical properties of these various notions of entropy production to spectral resonances of quantum transfer operators. The obtained results shed a new light on the nature of entropic fluctuations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation Solution with Generalized tanh-Shaped Hyperbolic Potential: Application to Charmonium and Bottomonium Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we advance the understanding of the fundamental interactions by using a generalized tanh shaped hyperbolic potential to investigate bound state solutions of the Dirac equation. Using the Nikiforov Uvarov method, we derive energy eigenvalues and radial wave functions in various quantum states, with the results expressed in terms of hypergeometric polynomials. The results of our analysis indicate that the energy eigenvalues are strongly correlated with the potential parameters and covered several fundamental potential models used to expose a nontrivial behaviour that occurred within quantum systems. Further, using this potential to model mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium, we show that results for the calculated quark mass spectra align closely with experimentally observed values, reflecting the veracity and accuracy of the approach. This close correspondence between calculated and experimental spectra highlights this potential model's efficacy in describing heavy quarkonium systems. The insights gained from this study reinforce the applicability of this potential model in quantum mechanics and particle physics and lay a foundation for its extension to other quantum systems, suggesting a feasible avenue for future research.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Subdiffusion from a Damped Bath Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A damped heat bath is a modification of the standard oscillator heat bath model, wherein each bath oscillator itself has a Markovian coupling to its own heat bath. We modify such a model as described in $\textit{Plyukhin (2019)}$ to one where the oscillators undergo linear rather than constant damping, and find that this generates a memory kernel which behaves like $k(t) \sim 1/t$ as $t\to \infty$ when the spectral density is Ohmic. This is a boundary case not considered in previous works. As the memory kernel does not have a finite integral, it is subdiffusive, and we numerically show the diffusion to go as $\langle\Delta Q^{2}(t)\rangle \sim t/\log(t)$ as $t\to \infty$. We also numerically calculate the velocity correlation function in the asymptotic regime and use it to confirm the aforementioned subdiffusion.</description>

Abstract: Erbium ions in crystals show considerable promise for the technologies that will form the backbone of future networked quantum information technology. Despite advances in leveraging erbium's fibre-compatible infrared transition for classical and quantum applications, the transitions are, in general, not well understood. We present detailed absorption and laser site-selective spectroscopy of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) centre in CaF$_2$:Er$^{3+}$ as an interesting erbium site case study. The $^{4}$I$_{15/2}$Z$_1 \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{13/2}$Y$_1$ transition has a low-temperature inhomogeneous linewidth of 1 GHz with hyperfine structure observable from the $^{167}$Er isotope. A parametrized crystal-field Hamiltonian is fitted to 34 energy levels and the two ground state magnetic splitting factors. The wavefunctions are used to perform a transition intensity analysis and electric-dipole parameters are fitted to absorption oscillator strengths. Simulated spectra for the $^{4}$I$_{11/2}\rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ and $^{4}$I$_{13/2} \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ inter-multiplet transitions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spectra. The $^{4}$I$_{13/2}$ excited state lifetime is 25.0\,ms and the intensity calculation is in excellent agreement with this value.</description>

Abstract: Laser site-selective spectroscopy and high-resolution absorption measurements have been used to determine 51 crystal-field energy levels for one of the Ho$^{3+}$ centres in Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$. This centre is denoted as Site 2 and has been tentatively assigned as the seven-fold coordinated centre.
  High resolution absorption measurements reveal complex hyperfine patterns that obey and approximate selection rule. The application of a magnetic field along the three optical axes reveals the presence of avoided crossings below 0.5 Tesla, in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K$_2$YF$_5$ crystals doped with lanthanide ions have a variety of possible optical applications. Owing to the low symmetry of the system, the crystal structure cannot be unambiguously determined by x-ray diffraction. However, electron-paramagnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that lanthanide ions substitute for yttrium in sites of C$_{\rm s}$ local symmetry. In this work, we use high-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy to determine electronic energy levels for Er$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 39 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 7 multiplets of the Er$^{3+}$ ion, have been assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Er$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Our model is fitted not only to the electronic energy levels, but also to the ground-state g-tensor. This magnetic-splitting data defines the axis system of the calculation, avoiding ambiguities associated with low-symmetry crystal-field fits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing x-Bohm theory and p-Bohm theory, we construct the position and momentum trajectories of single-mode and superposed-mode Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams. The dependence of divergence velocity and rotation velocity on the initial position and propagation distance is quantified, indicating that LG beams exhibit subluminal effects, even in free space. Additionally, we clarify the formation of the petal-shaped intensity distribution of the superposed-mode LG beam in terms of motion trajectory, where the particle-like trajectory and wave-like interference are ``simultaneously" observed. Our work provides an intuitive way to visualize the propagation characteristics of LG beams and deepen the comprehension of Bohm-like theory.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously enhancing brightness and purity of WSe$_2$ single photon emitter using high-aspect-ratio nanopillar array on metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer semiconductor transferred on nanopillar arrays provides site-controlled, on-chip single photon emission, which is a scalable light source platform for quantum technologies. However, the brightness of these emitters reported to date often falls short of the perceived requirement for such applications. Also, the single photon purity usually degrades as the brightness increases. Hence, there is a need for a design methodology to achieve enhanced emission rate while maintaining high single photon purity. Using WSe$_2$ on high-aspect-ratio ($\sim 3$ - at least two-fold higher than previous reports) nanopillar arrays, here we demonstrate $&gt;10$ MHz single photon emission rate in the 770-800 nm band that is compatible with quantum memory and repeater networks (Rb-87-D1/D2 lines), and satellite quantum communication. The emitters exhibit excellent purity (even at high emission rates) and improved out-coupling due to the use of a gold back reflector that quenches the emission away from the nanopillar.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Bistability of Fermionic Atoms Coupled to a Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady state phase diagram of fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the the mean-field approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor Networks (TNs) are a computational paradigm used for representing quantum many-body systems. Recent works have shown how TNs can also be applied to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yielding comparable results to standard supervised learning techniques.In this work, we study the use of Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) in high-frequency real-time applications by exploiting the low-latency hardware of the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We present different implementations of TTN classifiers, capable of performing inference on classical ML datasets as well as on complex physics data. A preparatory analysis of bond dimensions and weight quantization is realized in the training phase, together with entanglement entropy and correlation measurements, that help setting the choice of the TTN architecture. The generated TTNs are then deployed on a hardware accelerator; using an FPGA integrated into a server, the inference of the TTN is completely offloaded.

      <title>Many-body gap protection of motional dephasing of an optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation and metrology with atoms, ions, and molecules often rely on using light fields to manipulate their internal states. The absorbed momentum from the light fields can induce spin-orbit coupling and associated motional-induced (Doppler) dephasing, which may limit the coherence time available for metrology and simulation. We experimentally demonstrate the suppression of Doppler dephasing on a strontium optical clock transition by enabling atomic interactions through a shared mode in a high-finesse optical ring cavity. The interactions create a many-body energy gap that increases with atom number, suppressing motional dephasing when it surpasses the dephasing energy scale. This collective approach offers an alternative to traditional methods, like Lamb-Dicke confinement or M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, for advancing optical quantum sensors and simulations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Variational Quantum Compiling</title>

Abstract: Variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithms aim to approximate deep quantum circuits with shallow parameterized ansatzes, making them more suitable for NISQ hardware. In this article a variant of VQC named the recursive variational quantum compiling (RVQC) algorithm is proposed. Existing VQC algorithms typically require coherently executing the full circuit during compilation. Under the influence of noise, sufficiently deep target circuits make compiling unfeasible using ordinary VQC. Since the compiling is often accomplished using a gradient-based quantum-classical approach, the quantum noise manifest as a noisy gradient during optimization, making convergence hard to obtain. On the other hand, RVQC can compile a circuit by first dividing it into $N$ shorter sub-circuits, then evaluate one sub-circuit at a time. As a result, the circuit depth required to implement RVQC is not dependent on the depth of the target circuit, but on the depth of the sub-circuits. Choosing a high enough $N$ thus ensures sufficiently shallow sub-circuit which can be successfully compiled individually. RVQC was compared with VQC on a noise model of the IBM Santiago device with the goal of compiling several randomly generated five-qubit circuits of approximately depth 1000. It was shown that VQC was not able to converge within 500 iterations of optimization. On the other hand, RVQC was able to converge to a fidelity of $0.90 \pm 0.05$ within a total of 500 iterations when splitting the target circuits into $N = 5$ parts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement growth via splitting of a few thermal quanta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quanta splitting is an essential generator of Gaussian entanglement, exemplified by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states and apparently the most commonly occurring form of entanglement. In general, it results from the strong pumping of a nonlinear process with a highly coherent and low-noise external drive. In contrast, recent experiments involving efficient trilinear processes in trapped ions and superconducting circuits have opened the complementary possibility to test the splitting of a few thermal quanta. Stimulated by such small thermal energy, a strong degenerate trilinear coupling generates large amounts of nonclassicality, detectable by more than 3 dB of distillable quadrature squeezing. Substantial entanglement can be generated via frequent passive linear coupling to a third mode present in parallel with the trilinear coupling. This new form of entanglement, outside any Gaussian approximation, surprisingly grows with the mean number of split thermal quanta; a quality absent from Gaussian entanglement. Using distillable squeezing we shed light on this new entanglement mechanism for nonlinear bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the number of measurements for vibrational structure on quantum computers: coordinates and measurement schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges prohibiting demonstrations of practical quantum advantages for near-term devices amounts to excessive measurement overheads for estimating relevant physical quantities such as ground state energies. However, with major differences between the electronic and vibrational structure of molecules, the question of how the resource requirements of computing anharmonic, vibrational states can be reduced remains relatively unexplored compared to its electronic counterpart. Importantly, bosonic commutation relations, distinguishable Hilbert spaces and vibrational coordinates allow manipulations of the vibrational system that can be exploited to minimize resource requirements. In this work, we investigate the impact of different coordinate systems and measurement schemes on the number of measurements needed to estimate anharmonic, vibrational states for a variety of three-mode (six-mode) molecules. We demonstrate an average of 3-fold (1.5-fold), with up to 7-fold (2.5-fold), reduction in the number of measurements required by employing appropriate coordinate transformations, based on an automized construction of qubit Hamiltonians from a conventional vibrational structure program.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>A real-time, scalable, fast and highly resource efficient decoder for a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unleash the potential of quantum computers, noise effects on qubits' performance must be carefully managed. The decoders responsible for diagnosing noise-induced computational errors must use resources efficiently to enable scaling to large qubit counts and cryogenic operation. Additionally, they must operate at speed, to avoid an exponential slowdown in the logical clock rate of the quantum computer. To overcome such challenges, we introduce the Collision Clustering decoder and implement it on FPGA and ASIC hardware. We simulate logical memory experiments using the leading quantum error correction scheme, the surface code, and demonstrate MHz decoding speed - matching the requirements of fast-operating modalities such as superconducting qubits - up to an 881 and 1057 qubits surface code with the FPGA and ASIC, respectively. The ASIC design occupies 0.06 mm$^2$ and consumes only 8 mW of power. Our decoder is both highly performant and resource efficient, unlocking a viable path to practically realising fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Relating Wigner's Friend scenarios to Nonclassical Causal Compatibility, Monogamy Relations, and Fine Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical causal modeling was developed in order to explain violations of Bell inequalities while adhering to relativistic causal structure and faithfulness -- that is, avoiding fine-tuned causal explanations. Recently, a no-go theorem that can be viewed as being stronger than Bell's theorem has been derived, based on extensions of the Wigner's friend thought experiment: the Local Friendliness (LF) no-go theorem. Here we show that the LF no-go theorem poses formidable challenges for the field of causal modeling, even when nonclassical and/or cyclic causal explanations are considered. We first recast the LF inequalities, one of the key elements of the LF no-go theorem, as special cases of monogamy relations stemming from a statistical marginal problem. We then further recast LF inequalities as causal compatibility inequalities stemming from a nonclassical causal marginal problem, for a causal structure implied by well-motivated causal-metaphysical assumptions. We find that the LF inequalities emerge from this causal structure even when one allows the latent causes of observed events to admit post-quantum descriptions, such as in a generalized probabilistic theory or in an even more exotic theory. We further prove that no nonclassical causal model can explain violations of LF inequalities without violating the No Fine-Tuning principle. Finally, we note that these obstacles cannot be overcome even if one appeals to cyclic causal models, and we discuss potential directions for further extensions of the causal modeling framework.</description>

      <title>Concurrent spin squeezing and light squeezing in an atomic ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed spin states and squeezed light are both key resources for quantum metrology and quantum information science, but have been separately investigated in experiments so far. Simultaneous generation of these two types of quantum states in one experiment setup is intriguing but remains a challenging goal. Here we propose a novel protocol based on judiciously engineered symmetric atom-light interaction, and report proof-of-principle experimental results of concurrent spin squeezing of $0.61\pm0.09~\mathrm{dB}$ and light squeezing of $0.65^{+0.11}_{-0.10}~\mathrm{dB}$ in a hot atomic ensemble. The squeezing process is deterministic, yielding fixed squeezing directions for both the light field and the collective atomic spin. Furthermore, the squeezed light modes lie in the multiple frequency sidebands of a single spatial mode. This new type of dual squeezed state is applicable for quantum enhanced metrology and quantum networks. Our method can be extended to other quantum platforms such as optomechanics, cold atom and trapped ions.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear boolean equation systems play an important role in a wide range of applications. Grover's algorithm is one of the best-known quantum search algorithms in solving the nonlinear boolean equation system on quantum computers. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to improve the efficiency under Grover's algorithm framework. A W-cycle circuit construction introduces a recursive idea to increase the solvable number of boolean equations given a fixed number of qubits. Then, a greedy compression technique is proposed to reduce the oracle circuit depth. Finally, a randomized Grover's algorithm randomly chooses a subset of equations to form a random oracle every iteration, which further reduces the circuit depth and the number of ancilla qubits. Numerical results on boolean quadratic equations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between face nonsignaling correlations, full nonlocality, all-versus-nothing proofs, and pseudotelepathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a quantum correlation $p$ is in a face of the nonsignaling polytope with no local points if and only if $p$ has nonlocal content 1, if and only if $p$ allows for a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like proof, and if and only if $p$ provides a perfect strategy for a nonlocal game. That is, face nonsignaling (FNS) correlations, full nonlocality (FN), all-versus nothing (AVN) proofs, and pseudotelepathy (PT) are equivalent. This shows that different resources behind a wide variety of fundamental results are in fact the same resource. We demonstrate that quantum correlations with FNS=FN=AVN=PT do not need to maximally violate a tight Bell inequality. We introduce a method for identifying quantum FNS=FN=AVN=PT correlations and use it to prove quantum mechanics does not allow for FNS=FN=AVN=PT neither in the (3,3;3,2) nor in the (3,2;3,4) Bell scenarios. This solves an open problem that, due to the FNS=FN=AVN=PT equivalence, has implications in several fields.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel general-purpose algorithm for Pauli decomposition that employs matrix slicing and addition rather than expensive matrix multiplication, significantly accelerating the decomposition of multi-qubit matrices. In a detailed complexity analysis, we show that the algorithm admits the best known worst-case scaling and more favorable runtimes for many practical examples. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the asymptotic speed-up already for small instance sizes, underscoring the algorithm's potential significance in the realm of quantum computing and quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

Abstract: A bipartite perfect quantum strategy (BPQS) allows two players who cannot communicate with each other to always win a nonlocal game. BPQSs are rare but fundamental in light of some recent results in quantum information, computation, and foundations. A more than 40-year old open problem is how many inputs (measurement settings) a BPQS requires. A related problem is how many inputs are needed if, in addition, the quantum system has minimum dimension. A third, apparently unrelated, problem is what is the connection between BPQSs and state-independent contextuality, which inspired the first BPQSs. Here, we solve the third problem: We prove that {\em every} BPQS defines a Kochen-Specker (KS) set. We use this result to identify the BPQS with the smallest number of inputs, both in the general case and in the case of minimum dimension, and solve some related problems. We argue that either the BPQSs presented are the solutions to the first and second problems or, after more than 56 years of research, we have missed some important KS set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters such as quantum dots, defects in diamond or in silicon have emerged as efficient single photon sources that are progressively exploited in quantum technologies. In 2019, it was shown that the emitted single photon states often include coherence with the vacuum component. Here we investigate how such photon-number coherence alters quantum interference experiments that are routinely implemented both for characterising or exploiting the generated photons. We show that it strongly modifies intensity correlation measurements in a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment and leads to errors in indistinguishability estimations. It also results in additional entanglement when performing partial measurements. We illustrate the impact on quantum protocols by evidencing modifications in heralding efficiency and fidelity of two-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: We consider an interacting bipartite network through a Bayesian game-theoretic framework and demonstrate that weak measurements introduce an inherent asymmetry that is not present when using standard projective measurements. These asymmetries are revealed in the expected payoff for a Bayesian version of Prisoner's dilemma, demonstrating that certain advantages can be found for given subsystems depending on the measurements performed in the network. We demonstrate that this setup allows measurement-induced control for one of the respective parties.</description>

Abstract: Neural quantum state (NQS) ans\"atze have shown promise in variational Monte Carlo algorithms by their theoretical capability of representing any quantum state. However, the reason behind the practical improvement in their performance with an increase in the number of parameters is not fully understood. In this work, we systematically study the efficiency of a shallow neural network to represent the ground states in different phases of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain, as the number of parameters increases. We train our ansatz by a supervised learning procedure, minimizing the infidelity w.r.t. the exact ground state. We observe that the accuracy of our ansatz improves with the network width in most cases, and eventually saturates. We demonstrate that this can be explained by looking at the spectrum of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), particularly its rank. By introducing an appropriate indicator, we establish that the QGT rank provides a useful diagnostic for the practical representation power of an NQS ansatz.</description>

      <title>Single and entangled atomic systems in thermal bath and the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect in the context of two-level single and entangled atomic systems that are static in a thermal bath. We consider the interaction between the systems and a massless scalar field, covering the scenarios of free space as well as within a cavity. Through the calculation of atomic transition rates and comparing with the results of [\textcolor{blue}{\textit{Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 085018}}], it is found that in free space there is an equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates of a uniformly accelerated atom with respect to an observer with that of a single atom which is static with respect to the observer and immersed in a thermal bath, as long as the temperature of the thermal bath matches the Unruh temperature. This equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates breaks down in the presence of a cavity. For two-atom systems, considering the initial state to be in a general pure entangled form, we find that in this case the equivalence between the upward and downward transition rates of the accelerated and static thermal bath scenarios holds only under specific limiting conditions in free space, but breaks down completely in a cavity setup. Though the ratio of the upward and downward transition rates in the thermal bath matches exactly with those of the accelerated systems in free space as well as inside the cavity.</description>

Abstract: Dissipation engineering offers a powerful tool for quantum technologies. Recently, new superconducting devices have achieved an engineered two-photon dissipation rate exceeding all other relevant timescales. In particular, they have proven most useful in preventing transitions between the logical states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a cat qubit. Here, we present three key applications of strong two-photon dissipation for quantum measurement and control, beyond cat qubit stabilization. Firstly, we demonstrate its efficacy in overcoming limitations encountered in Wigner tomography at high photon numbers. Secondly, we showcase its potential for realizing universal gates on cat qubits, exploiting the coherent mapping between cat qubit states and superpositions of 0 and 1 photons. Finally, we harness the transient dynamics of a cat state under two-photon dissipation to prepare squeezed cat states with a squeezing factor exceeding 3.96$\pm$0.07 dB.</description>

      <title>Genuine non-Gaussian entanglement of light and quantum coherence for an atom from noisy multiphoton spin-boson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing entanglement and quantum coherence plays a central role in advancing quantum technologies. In quantum optical light-atom platforms, these two fundamental resources are often associated with a Jaynes-Cummings model description describing the coherent exchange of a photon between an optical resonator mode and a two-level spin. In a generic nonlinear spin-boson system, more photons and more modes will take part in the interactions. Here we consider such a generalization -- the two-mode multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) model. We demonstrate how entanglement and quantum coherence can be optimally generated and subsequently manipulated in experimentally accessible parameter regimes. A detailed comparative analysis of this model reveals that nonlinearities within the MPJC interactions produce genuinely non-Gaussian entanglement, devoid of Gaussian contributions, from noisy resources. More specifically, strong coherent sources may be replaced by weaker, incoherent ones, significantly reducing the resource overhead, though at the expense of reduced efficiency. At the same time, increasing the multiphoton order of the MPJC interactions expedites the entanglement generation process, thus rendering the whole generation scheme again more efficient and robust. We further explore the use of additional dispersive spin-boson interactions and Kerr nonlinearities in order to create spin coherence solely from incoherent sources and to enhance the quantum correlations, respectively. As for the latter, somewhat unexpectedly, there is not necessarily an increase in quantum correlations due to the augmented nonlinearity. Towards possible applications of the MPJC model, we show how, with appropriately chosen experimental parameters, we can engineer arbitrary NOON states as well as the tripartite W state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel algorithm that learns a Hamiltonian from local expectations of its Gibbs state using the free energy variational principle. The algorithm avoids the need to compute the free energy directly, instead using efficient estimates of the derivatives of the free energy with respect to perturbations of the state. These estimates are based on a new entropy bound for Lindblad evolutions, which is of independent interest. We benchmark the algorithm by performing black-box learning of a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 100-qubit spin chain. A implementation of the algorithm with a Python front-end is made available for use.</description>

      <title>Efficient and precise quantum simulation of ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and precise framework to quantum simulate the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering. This framework employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements a compact scheme for encoding this basis upon lattice discretization. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. Our framework simulates the scattering by the efficient and precise algorithm of the truncated Taylor series. The qubit cost of our framework scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our framework advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our framework with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found. Our framework can be generalized to simulate the dynamics of various scattering problems in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the $f$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>

      <title>Entanglement classification and \emph{non-k}-separability certification via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-class fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems can be characterised using the notions of \emph{k}-separability and entanglement depth. A quantum state is \emph{k}-separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of \emph{k} entangled subsystems, and its entanglement depth is given by the size of the largest entangled subsystem. In this paper we propose a multipartite entanglement measure that satisfies the following criteria: (i) it can be used with both pure and mixed states; (ii) it is encoded in a single element of the density matrix, so it does not require knowledge of the full spectrum of the density matrix; (iii) it can be applied to large systems; and (iv) it can be experimentally verified. The proposed method allows the certification of \emph{non-k}-separability of a given quantum state. We show that the proposed method successfully classifies three-qubit systems into known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) classes, namely bipartite, \mbox{W-,} and GHZ-type entanglement. Furthermore, we characterise the \emph{non-k}-separability in known nine SLOCC classes of four-qubit states, absolutely maximally entangled states for five and six qubits and for arbitrary size qubit Dicke states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State convertibility is fundamental in the study of resource theory of quantum coherence. It is aimed at identifying when it is possible to convert a given coherent state to another using only incoherent operations. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of state convertibility under genuinely incoherent operations. It is found that convexity of the robustness of coherence plays a central role. Based on this, the majorization condition of determining convertibility from pure states to mixed states under strictly incoherent operations is provided. Moreover, maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed diagonal elements are determined. It is somewhat surprising that convexity of the robustness of coherence can also decide conversion between off-diagonal parts of coherent states. This might be a big step to answer completely the question of state convertibility for mixed states under incoherent operations.</description>

      <title>Searching Weighted Barbell Graphs with Laplacian and Adjacency Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum particle evolving by Schr\"odinger's equation in discrete space constitutes a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph of vertices and edges. When a vertex is marked by an oracle, the quantum walk effects a quantum search algorithm. Previous investigations of this quantum search algorithm on graphs with cliques have shown that the edges between the cliques can be weighted to enhance the movement of probability between the cliques to reach the marked vertex. In this paper, we explore the most restrictive form of this by analyzing search on a weighted barbell graph that consists of two cliques of the same size joined by a single weighted edge/bridge. This graph is generally irregular, so quantum walks governed by the graph Laplacian or by the adjacency matrix can differ. We show that the Laplacian quantum walk's behavior does not change, no matter the weight of the bridge, and so the single bridge is too restrictive to affect the walk. Similarly, the adjacency quantum walk's behavior is unchanged for most weights, but when the weight equals the size of a clique, the probability does collect at the clique containing the marked vertex, and utilizing a two-stage algorithm with different weights for each stage, the success probability is boosted from 0.5 to 0.996, independent of the size of the barbell graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.</description>

Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Heisenberg Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic quantifies the non-Clifford operations required for preparing a state on quantum processors and sets bounds on the classical computational complexity of simulating quantum dynamics. We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions, while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower-bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. It is operationally well-defined as quantifying how well one can approximate an operator with one that has only few Pauli strings; analogous to the relation between entanglement entropy and tensor-network truncation. An immediate advantage is that the operator stabilizer entropies exhibit inherent locality through a Lieb-Robinson bound, making them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that random evolution typically has approximately maximal magic in the Heisenberg picture for all R\'enyi indices, and evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we compute the operator stabilizer entropy evolution for an interacting integrable XXZ circuit. In this case, magic quickly saturates to a constant. This monotone reveals structural properties of many-body magic generation, and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Scalable &amp; Noise-Robust Communication Advantage of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed computing, involving multiple servers collaborating on designated computations, faces a critical challenge in optimizing inter-server communication -- an issue central to the study of communication complexity. Quantum resources offer advantages over classical methods in addressing this challenge. In this work, we investigate a distributed computing scenario with multiple senders and a single receiver, establishing a scalable advantage of multipartite quantum entanglement in mitigating communication complexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the receiver and the senders share a multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state -- a quintessential form of genuine multipartite entanglement -- certain global functions of the distributed inputs can be computed with only one bit of classical communication from each sender. In contrast, without entanglement, two bits of communication are required from all but one sender. Consequently, quantum entanglement reduces communication overhead by (n-1) bits for n senders, allowing for arbitrary scaling with an increasing number of senders. We also show that the entanglement-based protocol exhibits significant robustness under white noise, thereby establishing the potential for experimental realization of this novel quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum heat engine based on a quantum Otto cycle, whose working substance reproduces the same outcomes of a SU(1,1) interference process at the end of each adiabatic transformation. This device takes advantage of the extraordinary quantum metrological features of the SU(1,1) interferometer to better discriminate the sources of uncertainty of relevant observables during each adiabatic stroke of the cycle. Applications to circuit QED platforms are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stronger Nonlocality in GHZ States: A Step Beyond the Conventional GHZ Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox, involving quantum systems with three or more subsystems, offers an 'all-vs-nothing' test of quantum nonlocality. Unlike Bell tests for bipartite systems, which reveal statistical contradictions, the GHZ paradox demonstrates a definitive (i.e. 100%) conflict between local hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics. Given this, how can the claim made in the title be justified? The key lies in recognising that GHZ games are typically played under a predefined promise condition for input distribution. By altering this promise, different GHZ games can be constructed. Here, we introduce a randomized variant of GHZ game, where the promise condition is randomly selected from multiple possibilities and revealed to only one of the parties chosen randomly. We demonstrate that this randomized GHZ paradox can also be perfectly resolved using a GHZ state, revealing a potentially stronger form of nonlocality than the original paradox. The claim of enhanced nonlocality is supported by its operational implications: correlations yielding perfect success in the randomized game offer a greater communication advantage than traditional GHZ correlations in a distributed multi-party communication complexity task.</description>

      <title>Nearly degenerate ground states of a checkerboard antiferromagnet and their bosonic interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ model system with antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings on a $J_1$-$J_2$ checkerboard lattice, known as the planar pyrochlore model, is strongly frustrated and associated with a two-to-one dimensional crossover. Using the Projected Entangled Simplex States tensor network ansatz, we identify a large number of nearly degenerate states in the frustrated region ($J_1&lt;J_2$). Specifically, we find the long-sought crossed-dimer valence bond solid (VBS) state to be the ground state at $J_1\lesssim J_2$, while various 1D AF correlated states take over the rest. We verify the stability of the VBS state against nematic perturbation. The corresponding bosonic picture provides an intuitive understanding of the low-energy physics. Particularly, it predicts weaker VBS states in the easy-plane limit, which we confirm numerically. Our results clarify the most essential ground state properties of this interesting system and demonstrate the usefulness of bosonic picture in dealing with frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Gapless Spin Liquid and Non-local Corner Excitation in the Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on Fractal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the mathematical beauty and the recent experimental realizations of fractal systems, we study the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Sierpi\'nski gasket. The fractal porous feature generates new kinds of frustration to exhibit exotic quantum states. Using advanced tensor network techniques, we identify a quantum gapless-spin-liquid ground state in fractional spatial dimension. This fractal spin system also demonstrates nontrivial non-local properties. While the extremely short-range correlation causes a highly degenerate spin form factor, the entanglement in this fractal system suggests a long-range scaling behavior. We also study the dynamic structure factor and clearly identify the gapless excitation with a stable corner excitation emerged from the ground-state entanglement. Our results unambiguously point out multiple essential properties of this fractal spin system, and open a new route to explore spin liquid and frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concepts of the complex partition functions and the Fisher zeros provide intrinsic statistical mechanisms for finite temperature and real time dynamical phase transitions. We extend the utility of these complexifications to quantum phase transitions. We exactly identify different Fisher zeros on lines or closed curves and elucidate their correspondence with domain-wall excitations or confined mesons for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. The crossover behavior of the Fisher zeros provides a fascinating picture for criticality near the quantum phase transition, where the excitation energy scales are quantitatively determined. We further confirm our results by tensor network calculations and demonstrate a clear signal of deconfined meson excitations from the disruption of the closed zero curves. Our results unambiguously show significant features of Fisher zeros for a quantum phase transition and open up a new route to explore quantum criticality.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the one-loop quantum entanglement entropy in ten-dimensional Type-II string theory using the orbifold method by analytically continuing in $N$ the genus-one partition function for string orbifolds on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ conical spaces known for all odd integers $N &gt; 1$. We show that the tachyonic contributions to the orbifold partition function can be appropriately summed and analytically continued to an expression that is finite in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ resulting in a finite and calculable answer for the entanglement entropy. We discuss the implications of the finiteness of the entanglement entropy for the information paradox, quantum gravity, and holography.</description>

      <title>Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters.
  We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points.
  Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
  Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Optomechanical Dark-matter INstrument (ODIN), based on a new method for the direct detection of low-mass dark matter. We consider dark matter interacting with superfluid helium in an optomechanical cavity. Using an effective field theory, we calculate the rate at which dark matter scatters off phonons in a highly populated, driven acoustic mode of the cavity. This scattering process deposits a phonon into a second acoustic mode in its ground state. The deposited phonon ($\mu$eV range) is then converted to a photon (eV range) via an optomechanical interaction with a pump laser. This photon can be efficiently detected, providing a means to sensitively probe keV scale dark matter. We provide realistic estimates of the backgrounds and discuss the technical challenges associated with such an experiment. We calculate projected limits on dark matter-nucleon interactions for dark matter masses ranging from 0.5 to 300 keV and estimate that a future device could probe cross-sections as low as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})$ cm$^2$.</description>

Abstract: Dual-unitary circuits are being vigorously studied as models of many-body quantum chaos that can be solved exactly for correlation functions and time evolution of states. Here we define their classical counterparts as dual-canonical transformations and associated dual-Koopman operators. Like their quantum counterparts, the correlations vanish everywhere except on the light cone, on which they decay with rates governed by a simple contractive map. Providing a large class of such dual-canonical transformations, we study in detail the example of a coupled standard map and show analytically that arbitrarily away from the integrable case, in the thermodynamic limit the system is mixing. We also define ``perfect" Koopman operators that lead to the correlation vanishing everywhere including on the light cone and provide an example of a cat-map lattice which would qualify to be a Bernoulli system at the apex of the ergodic hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Individually tunable tunnelling coefficients in optical lattices using local periodic driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have emerged as powerful quantum simulators of translationally invariant systems with many applications in e.g.\ strongly-correlated and topological systems. However, the ability to locally tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this provides full individual control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various example configurations realising interesting topological models such as extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realise by other means. Extending to two dimensions, we demonstrate that local periodic driving in a Lieb lattice engineers a 2D network with fully controllable tunnelling magnitudes. In a three-site plaquette, we show full simultaneous control over the relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone to building a fully programmable 2D tight-binding model. We also explicitly demonstrate how utilise our technique to generate a magnetic field gradient in 2D. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many different lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-interactive ZK (NIZK) proof enables verification of NP statements without revealing secrets about them. However, an adversary that obtains a NIZK proof may be able to clone this proof and distribute arbitrarily many copies of it to various entities: this is inevitable for any proof that takes the form of a classical string. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to rely on quantum information in order to build NIZK proof systems that are impossible to clone.
  We define and construct unclonable non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (of knowledge) for NP, addressing a question first posed by Aaronson (CCC 2009). Besides satisfying the zero-knowledge and argument of knowledge properties, these proofs additionally satisfy unclonability. Very roughly, this ensures that no adversary can split an honestly generated proof of membership of an instance $x$ in an NP language $\mathcal{L}$ and distribute copies to multiple entities that all obtain accepting proofs of membership of $x$ in $\mathcal{L}$. Our result has applications to unclonable signatures of knowledge, which we define and construct in this work; these non-interactively prevent replay attacks.</description>

Abstract: We consider $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Type-II compactifications to four and six dimensions on several Calabi-Yau manifolds in the orbifold limit with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy. The spectrum can contain tachyons in the doubly-twisted sectors which can lead to new infrared divergences for the partition function that are not present in the orbifolds of the uncompactified ten-dimensional theory. We show that all tachyonic contributions in these models admit a resummation and analytic continuation that yields finite entropy in the physical region $0 &lt; N \leq 1$ just as in ten dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study static superfluid properties of alkali-earth-like Fermi atomic systems in the presence of orbital Feshbach resonance. Using a two-band description of the ground state and excited state and a mean-field approximation of the intra-band atomic pairing, we investigate the phase transitions and crossover between BCS and Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) superfluidity. At zero temperature, we find exact BCS analytical solutions for the mean-field gap equations and number equations. Using these exact solutions, we calculate various static properties, such as superfluid order parameters, chemical potentials, density variations, density profiles, correlation and coherence lengths, ground-state energy, and Tan's contact density across the entire BCS-BEC crossover region. We anticipate that our closed-form analytical results can be used as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical investigations and will have an impact on the current understanding of two-band superconductors such as MgB$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement on Black Hole Horizons in String Theory and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact one-loop partition function of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifolds of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the aim to compute the entanglement entropy of the black hole horizon in string theory as a function of the mass and spin of the black hole and the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ radius. We analyze the tachyonic contribution to the modular integrand for the partition function known for odd integers $N&gt;1$ and show that it admits an analytic continuation resulting in a finite answer for the modular integral in the physical region $0&lt; N \leq 1$. We discuss the flat space limit and the relevance of this computation for quantum gravity near black hole horizons and holography in relation to the thermal entropy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics at the Quantum-Classical Boundary: A Self-Consistent Framework Based on Adiabatic-Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopic thermal machines promise to play an important role in future quantum technologies. Making such devices widely applicable will require effective strategies to channel their output into easily accessible storage systems like classical degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that makes it possible to model such quantum-classical hybrid devices in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that the quantum part of the device is subject to strong decoherence and dissipation induced by a thermal reservoir. Due to the ensuing separation of time scales between slowly evolving classical and fast relaxing quantum degrees of freedom, the dynamics of the hybrid system can be described by means of adiabatic-response theory. We show that, upon including fluctuations in a minimally consistent way, the resulting equations of motion can be equipped with a first and second law, both on the ensemble level and on the level of individual trajectories of the classical part of the system, where thermodynamic quantities like heat and work become stochastic variables. As an application of our theory, we work out a physically transparent model of a quantum-classical hybrid engine, whose working system consists of a chain of Rydberg atoms, which is confined in an optical cavity and driven by periodic temperature variations. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that the engine can sustain periodic oscillations of a movable mirror, which acts as a classical load, against external friction and extract the full distributions of input heat and output work. By making the statistics of thermodynamic processes in quantum-classical hybrid systems accessible without the need to further specify a measurement protocol, our work contributes to bridging the long-standing gap between classical and quantum stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal order parameter of pair superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality in regimes of total particle number conservation. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the atomic superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a family of quantum walk models with electric fields, the spectrum is the unit circle for any irrational field. The result also holds for the associated CMV matrices defined by skew-shifts. Generalizations to CMV matrices with skew-shifts on higher dimensional torus are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced field-linked states of ultracold polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of stable bound states between pairs of ultracold diatomic molecules with the aid of a static electric field and 1D harmonic confinement. We focus on collisions of NaK-NaK identical fermions, for which we find that currently achievable experimental parameters allow the observation of these confinement-induced field-linked bound states as scattering resonances. The bound state is highly stable with lifetimes estimated to be tens of seconds long. With the diatomic molecules bound at distances a fraction of the dipolar length scale, these complexes allow for explorations of polyatomic chemistry and Fermi gas superfluid pairing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>
