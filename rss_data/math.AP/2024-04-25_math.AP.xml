      <title>Sign Changing Critical Points for Locally Lipschitz Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, some existence results for sign-changing critical points of locally Lipschitz functionals in real Banach space are obtained by the method combining the invariant sets of descending ow method with a quantitative deformation. First we assume the locally Lipschitz functionals to be outwardly directed on the the boundary of some closed convex sets of the real Banach space. By using the relation between the critical points on the Banach space and those of the closed convex sets, we construct a quantitative deformation lemma, and then we obtain some linking type of critical points theorems. These theoretical results can be applied to the study of the existence of sign-changing solutions for differential inclusion problems. In contrast with the related results in the literatures, the main results of this paper relax the requirement that the functional being of C1 continuous to locally Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>A note on the lifespan of solutions to the semilinear wave equation with weighted nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lifespan of solutions to a specific variant of the semilinear wave equation, which incorporates weighted nonlinearity $$ u_{tt}-u_{xx} =|x|^\alpha |u|^p, \quad\mbox{for}\;\;\; (t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}, $$ where $p&gt;1$, $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$. We explore the behavior of solutions for small initial data, considering the influence of weighted nonlinearities on the lifespan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work [Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'eaire 2024], Gastel and Neff introduced an interesting system from a geometrically nonlinear flat cosserat micropolar model and established interior regularity in the critical dimension. Motived by this work, in this article, we establish both interior regularity and sharp $L^p$ regularity for their system in supercritical dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the temporal estimates for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive decay rates of the solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations. We first improve the decay rate of weak solutions of these equations by refining the Fourier splitting method with initial data in the space of pseudo-measures. We also deal with these equations with initial data in Lei-Lin spaces and find decay rates of solutions in Lei-Lin spaces.</description>

      <title>Periodic homogenisation for singular PDEs with generalised Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider periodic homogenisation problems for gPAM, $\Phi^{4}_{3}$ and modified KPZ equations. Using Littlewood-Paley blocks, we establish para-products and commutator estimates for generalised Besov spaces associated with self-adjoint elliptic operators. With this, we show that, the homogenisation and renormalisation procedures commute in aforementioned models under suitable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of a Hele-Shaw type model and its non-symmetric traveling wave solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Hele-Shaw model that describes tumor growth subject to nutrient supply. This model was recently studied in \cite{feng2022tumor} via asymptotic analysis. Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we provide a rigorous derivation of this Hele-Shaw model by taking the incompressible limit of the porous medium reaction-diffusion equation, which solidifies the mathematical foundations of the model. Secondly, from a bifurcation theory perspective, we prove the existence of non-symmetric traveling wave solutions to the model, which reflect the intrinsic boundary instability in tumor growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional jet flows for compressible full Euler system with general vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the well-posedness theory of two-dimensional compressible subsonic jet flows for steady full Euler system with general vorticity. Inspired by the analysis in arXiv:2006.05672, we show that the stream function formulation for such system admits a variational structure. Then the existence and uniqueness of a smooth subsonic jet flow can be established by the variational method developed by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman. Furthermore, the far fields behavior of the flow and the existence of a critical upstream pressure are also obtained.</description>

      <title>One-bubble nodal blow-up for asymptotically critical stationary Schr\"odinger-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this work families $(u_\epsilon)_{\epsilon &gt;0}$ of sign-changing blowing-up solutions of asymptotically critical stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the following type: $$\Delta_g u_\epsilon + h_\epsilon u_\epsilon = |u_{\epsilon}|^{p_\epsilon-2} u_\epsilon $$ in a closed manifold $(M,g)$, where $h_\epsilon$ converges to $h$ in $C^1(M)$. Assuming that $(u_\epsilon)_{\epsilon &gt;0}$ blows-up as \emph{a single sign-changing bubble}, we obtain necessary conditions for blow-up that constrain the localisation of blow-up points and exhibit a strong interaction between $h$, the geometry of $(M,g)$ and the bubble itself. These conditions are new and are a consequence of the sign-changing nature of $u_\epsilon$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss exponential decay in $L^p(R^N)$, $1\leq p\leq \infty$,of solutions of a fractional Schr\"odinger parabolic equation with a locally uniformly integrable potential. The exponential type of the semigroup of solutions is considered and its independence in of $1\leq p\leq \infty$ is addressed. We characterise a large class of potentials for which solutions decay exponentially.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spectral Problems for Collapsing Manifolds II: Quantitative Stability of Reconstruction for Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of determining the metric-measure structure of collapsing manifolds from local measurements of spectral data. In the part I of the paper, we proved the uniqueness of the inverse problem and a continuity result for the stability in the closure of Riemannian manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. In this paper we show that when the collapse of dimension is $1$-dimensional, it is possible to obtain quantitative stability of the inverse problem for Riemannian orbifolds. The proof is based on an improved version of the quantitative unique continuation for the wave operator on Riemannian manifolds by removing assumptions on the covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor.</description>

      <title>Stability of Navier-Stokes equations with a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the viscous incompressible fluids in a three-dimensional horizontally periodic domain bounded below by a fixed smooth boundary and above by a free moving surface. The fluid dynamics are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with the effect of gravity and surface tension on the free surface. We develop a global well-posedness theory by a nonlinear energy method in low regular Sobolev spaces with several techniques, including: the horizontal energy-dissipation estimates, a new tripled bootstrap argument inspired by Guo and Tice [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.(2018)]. Moreover, the solution decays asymptotically to the equilibrium in an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>High-Order regularity for fully nonlinear elliptic transmission problems under weak convexity assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Schauder theory to transmission problems modelled by fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations of second order. We focus on operators F that fails to be concave or convex in the space of symmetric matrices. In a first scenario, it is considered that F enjoys a small ellipticity aperture. In our second case, we study regularity results where the convexity of the superlevel (or sublevel) sets is verified, implying that the operator F is quasiconcave (or quasiconvex).</description>

      <title>Higher H\"older regularity for a subquadratic nonlocal parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the H\"older regularity for solutions of the nonlocal evolutionary equation $$ \partial_t u+(-\Delta_p)^s u = 0. $$ Here, $(-\Delta_p)^s$ is the fractional $p$-Laplacian, $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2$. We establish H\"older regularity with explicit H\"older exponents. We also include the inhomogeneous equation with a bounded inhomogeneity. In some cases, the obtained H\"older exponents are almost sharp. Our results complement the previous results for the superquadratic case when $p\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all homogeneous polynomials $
  f_{m}$ of degree $m$, in $d$ variables,
  and each $j = 1, \dots , d$, we have
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\langle x_{j}^{2}f_{m},f_{m}\right\rangle _{L^{2}\left( \mathbb{S}%

  \geq
  \frac{\pi ^{2}}{4\left( m+ d + 1 \right)^{2}}
  \left
  \langle
  f_{m},f_{m}\right\rangle _{L^{2}\left( \mathbb{S}^{d-1}\right) }.
  \end{equation*} This result is used to establish the existence of entire harmonic solutions of the Dirichlet problem, when the data are given by entire functions of order sufficiently low on nonhyperbolic quadratic hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the cubic Schr\"odinger equation on Diophantine waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cubic Schr\"odinger equation posed on product spaces subject to a generic Diophantine condition. Our analysis shows that the small-amplitude solutions undergo modified scattering to an effective dynamics governed by some interactions that do not amplify the Sobolev norms. This is in sharp contrast with the infinite energy cascade scenario observed by Hani--Pausader--Tzvetkov--Visciglia in the absence of Diophantine conditions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of stochastic integrals with applications to transport equations and conservation laws with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence of stochastic integrals driven by Wiener processes $W_n$, with $W_n \to W$ almost surely in $C_t$, is crucial in analyzing SPDEs. Our focus is on the convergence of the form $\int_0^T V_n\, \mathrm{d} W_n \to \int_0^T V\, \mathrm{d} W$, where $\{V_n\}$ is bounded in $L^p(\Omega \times [0,T];X)$ for a Banach space $X$ and some finite $p &gt; 2$. This is challenging when $V_n$ converges to $V$ weakly in the temporal variable. We supply convergence results to handle stochastic integral limits when strong temporal convergence is lacking. A key tool is a uniform mean $L^1$ time translation estimate on $V_n$, an estimate that is easily verified in many SPDEs. However, this estimate alone does not guarantee strong compactness of $(\omega,t)\mapsto V_n(\omega,t)$. Our findings, especially pertinent to equations exhibiting singular behavior, are substantiated by establishing several stability results for stochastic transport equations and conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: III. Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of the characteristic initial-boundary value problem for the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates (including Bondi, double-null and affine). We propose a definition of strong hyperbolicity of a system of partial differential equations of any order, and show that the Einstein equations in Bondi-like coordinates in their second-order form used in numerical relativity do not meet it, in agreement with results of Giannakopoulos et al for specific first-order reductions. In the principal part, frozen coefficient approximation that one uses to examine hyperbolicity, we explicitly construct the general solution to identify the solutions that obstruct strong hyperbolicity. Independently, we present a first-order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein equations in Bondi gauge, linearised about Schwarzschild, thus completing work by Frittelli. This establishes an energy norm ($L^2$ in the metric perturbations and selected first and second derivatives), in which the initial-boundary value problem, with initial data on an outgoing null cone and boundary data on a timelike cylinder or an ingoing null cone, is well-posed, thus verifying a conjecture by Giannakopoulos et al. Unfortunately, our method does not extend to the pure initial-value problem on a null cone with regular vertex.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Inference in McKean-Vlasov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer the potential $W$ itself at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>

      <title>Functional and variational aspects of nonlocal operators associated with linear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general difference quotient representation for non-local operators associated with a first-order linear operator. We establish new local to non-local estimates and strong localization principles in various spaces of functions, measures and distributions, which fully generalize those known for gradients. Under suitable assumptions, we also establish the invariance of quasiconvexity within the proposed local-nonlocal setting. Applications to the fine properties of $\mathcal A$-gradient measures are further discussed.</description>

      <title>The three dimensional stochastic Zakharov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three dimensional stochastic Zakharov system in the energy space, where the Schr\"odinger equation is driven by linear multiplicative noise and the wave equation is driven by additive noise. We prove the well-posedness of the system up to the maximal existence time and provide a blow-up alternative. We further show that the solution exists at least as long as it remains below the ground state. Two main ingredients of our proof are refined rescaling transformations and the normal form method. Moreover, in contrast to the deterministic setting, our functional framework also incorporates the local smoothing estimate for the Schr\"odinger equation in order to control lower order perturbations arising from the noise. Finally, we prove a regularization by noise result which states that finite time blowup before any given time can be prevented with high probability by adding sufficiently large non-conservative noise. The key point of its proof is an estimate in Strichartz spaces for solutions of a Schr\"odinger type equation with a nonlocal potential involving the free wave.</description>

      <title>Gradient bounds for strongly singular or degenerate parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions $u:\Omega_{T}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to parabolic systems of the type \[ u_{t}-\mathrm{div}\,A(x,t,Du)=f \qquad \mathrm{in}\ \Omega_{T}=\Omega\times(0,T), \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq2$, $T&gt;0$ and the datum $f$ belongs to a suitable Orlicz space. The main novelty here is that the partial map $\xi\mapsto A(x,t,\xi)$ satisfies standard $p$-growth and ellipticity conditions for $p&gt;1$ only outside the unit ball $\{\vert\xi\vert&lt;1\}$. For $p&gt;\frac{2n}{n+2}$ we establish that any weak solution \[ u\in C^{0}((0,T);L^{2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{N}))\cap L^{p}(0,T;W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{N})) \] admits a locally bounded spatial gradient $Du$. Moreover, assuming that $u$ is essentially bounded, we recover the same result in the case $1&lt;p\leq\frac{2n}{n+2}$ and $f=0$. Finally, we also prove the uniqueness of weak solutions to a Cauchy-Dirichlet problem associated with the parabolic system above. We emphasize that our results include both the degenerate case $p\geq2$ and the singular case $1&lt;p&lt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend G{\'e}rard's formula for the solution of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to square integrable and real valued initial data. Combined with this formula, we also extend the G{\'e}rard's formula for the zero dispersion limit of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the line to more singular initial data. In the derivation of the extension of the formula for the zero dispersion limit, we also find an interesting integral equality, which might be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for Solvability of Operators of Subprincipal Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ on the subprincipal symbol is sufficient for local solvability of pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. These are the operators having real principal symbol which vanish on an involutive manifold where the subprincipal symbol is of principal type. This condition has previously been shown by the author to be necessary for local solvability of pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type.</description>

      <title>Fractional Boundary Value Problems and elastic sticky Brownian motions, II: The bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04162v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sticky diffusion processes spend finite time (and finite mean time) on a lower-dimensional boundary. Once the process hits the boundary, then it starts again after a random amount of time. While on the boundary it can stay or move according to dynamics that are different from those in the interior. Such processes may be characterized by a time-derivative appearing in the boundary condition for the governing problem. We use time changes obtained by right-inverses of suitable processes in order to describe fractional sticky conditions and the associated boundary behaviours. We obtain that fractional boundary value problems (involving fractional dynamic boundary conditions) lead to sticky diffusions spending an infinite mean time (and finite time) on a lower-dimensional boundary. Such a behaviour can be associated with a trap effect in the macroscopic point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for the isometric embedding of a Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ into Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^q$. Given $\alpha \in ]\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, we show that a $C^{1,\alpha}$ embedding $u: M \to \mathbb{R}^q$ is isometric if and only if the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on $u(M)\subset \mathbb{R}^q$ yield processes with the same law. The equivalence is first established for smooth embeddings; this is followed by a renormalization procedure for $C^{1,\alpha}$ embeddings. In particular, we also construct extrinsic Brownian motion when $g \in C^2$ and $u$ is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ isometric embedding.
  This formulation is based on a gedanken experiment that relates the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on an embedded manifold to the measurement of geodesic distance by observers in distinct frames of reference. This viewpoint provides a thermodynamic formalism for the isometric embedding problem that is suited to applications in geometric deep learning, stochastic optimization and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Critical axis of Ruelle resonances for Anosov flow with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>
