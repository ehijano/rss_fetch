      <title>Empirical Bolometric Correction and Zero-Point Constants of Visual Magnitudes from High-Resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method of obtaining bolometric corrections ($BC_{\rm V}$) from observed high-resolution, high-$S/N$ spectra is described. The method is applied to spectra of 128 stars collected from the literature with well-determined effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) with $S_\lambda(V)$ transparency profiles of Bessell and Landolt. Computed $BC_{\rm V}$ are found accurate within several milimagnitudes and the effect of different $S_\lambda(V)$ is found to be no more than 0.015 mag. Measured visual to bolometric ratio ($L_{\rm V}/L$) from the sample spectra and classically determined $BC_{\rm V}$ from bolometric ($M_{\rm Bol}$) and visual ($M_{\rm V}$) absolute magnitudes helped us to determine the zero-point constant ($C_{\rm 2}$) of the $BC_{\rm V}$ scale. Determined $C_{\rm 2}$ for each star for each $S_\lambda(V)$ profile revealed $C_{\rm 2} = 2.3653\pm0.0067$ mag if $S_\lambda(V)$ profile of Bessell is used, and $C_{\rm 2} = 2.3826\pm0.0076$ mag if $S_\lambda(V)$ profile of Landolt is used. Expanding $C_{\rm Bol} = 71.197425 ...$ mag and $c_{\rm Bol} = -18.997351 ...$ mag announced by IAU2015GARB2, and using definition of $C_{\rm 2} = C_{\rm Bol}-C_{\rm V} = c_{\rm Bol}-c_{\rm V}$, where capital $C$ is for the absolute and small $c$ is for the apparent, subscripts indicating bolometric and visual, the zero-point constants: $C_{\rm V} = 68.8321\pm0.0067$ mag and $c_{\rm V} = -21.3627\pm0.0067$ mag, if $L_{\rm V}$ and are in SI units, were determined corresponding to $S_\lambda(V)$ of Bessell. The zero-point constants corresponding to $S_\lambda(V)$ of Landolt are smaller, but the difference is not more than 0.02 mag. Typical and limiting accuracies for predicting a stellar luminosity from an apparent magnitude and a distance are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Lost Sisters Found: TESS and Gaia Reveal a Dissolving Pleiades Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most star clusters dissolve into the Galaxy over tens to hundreds of millions of years after they form. While recent Gaia studies have honed our view of cluster dispersal, the exact chronology of which star formation events begat which star cluster remnants remains unclear. This problem is acute after 100 Myr, when cluster remnants have spread over hundreds of parsecs and most age estimates for main sequence stars are too imprecise to link the stars to their birth events. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that combines TESS stellar rotation rates with Gaia kinematics to identify diffuse remnants of open clusters. We apply our method to the Pleiades, which previous studies have noted shows kinematic similarities to other nearby young stellar groups. We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure that contains multiple known clusters distributed over 600 pc. We refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex. On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud. This work establishes a scalable approach for tracing the genealogies of nearby clusters and further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. We aim to apply this methodology to other associations as part of the upcoming TESS All-Sky Rotation Survey.</description>

      <title>The Shape of the Solar Tachocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early helioseismic results have shown that the tachocline has a prolate shape. However, the models used in those studies constrained the tachocline to be either prolate or oblate. We use helioseismic data obtained from long time series (2304 and 4608 days) to determine the shape of the solar tachocline. Like previous work, we use forward modeling methods for this work; however, we allow more flexibility for the shape of the tachocline. We find that the tachocline does indeed deviate from a simple prolate structure and bulges out at mid latitudes. The center of the tachocline lies in the radiative zone at low latitudes, in the convection zone at intermediate latitudes, and back in the radiative zone at high latitudes. The high-latitude ($ &gt; 60^\circ$) behavior is, however, uncertain and model dependent. Models that allow more variation of the shape indicate that the tachocline at high latitudes is almost coincident with the base of the convection zone.</description>

      <title>MHSXtraPy - A Python code for the extrapolation of magnetohydrostatic fields on the Sun using analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Python code for calculating and displaying magnetic field extrapolations from given two-dimensional boundary conditions, specifically from solar surface magnetograms. The code implements analytical magnetohydrostatic models that incorporate the transition from non-force-free to force-free magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere. It allows for different parameterisations of this transition and includes functions to compute magnetic fields, plasma pressure, and density. Fast Fourier methods ensure efficient computation, and the output includes three-dimensional visualisations of field lines and plasma structures. The implementation is optimised for accessibility and speed, making it suitable for both research and educational purposes. The only prerequisite for running the code is a Python compiler. All source code, examples, input files, solutions, and instructions are available for download from GitHub.</description>

      <title>Characterizing TESS-Identified Quadruple and Higher Order Eclipsing Binaries: I. Speckle Imaging with DSSI and HRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's TESS mission has unveiled a plethora of eclipsing binaries (EBs), among them hundreds of triples and higher order, hierarchical systems. These complex targets require follow-up observations to enable full characterization of system architectures and identify the most compact multiples expected to undergo the most dramatic dynamical evolution. We report first results from a long-term effort to perform such follow-up, focusing here on multi-band speckle imaging of a majority, 57, of the sample of 97 quadruple and higher order eclipsing binaries (Q+EBs) identified via TESS light curves by V. B. Kostov et al. (2022). Diffraction-limited imaging with the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the ARC 3.5-meter telescope and HRCam on the SOAR 4.1-m telescope reveals nearly 60% of the 57 to resolve into two sources separated by $\geq$ 0.03 arcseconds. For these partly resolved systems, we report derived characteristics (e.g., relative position angle, angular separation, and magnitude differences in multiple passbands) from the speckle imaging. We find those Q+EBs partly resolved with 4-m class telescopes to have significantly inflated Gaia parallax errors and large Gaia RUWE, particularly for systems with separations comparable to Gaia's resolution limit (~0.6 arcseconds). For unresolved systems we report upper limits on angular and linear projected separations. We find two partly resolved Q+EBs with wide linear separations having eclipse timing variations that are therefore candidates of higher than quadruple multiplicity. Finally, we demonstrate how speckle imaging of resolved Q+EBs during an eclipse can clarify which speckle-resolved Q+EB subsystem is associated with a particular set of TESS eclipses.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Relationship Between Stellar X-ray Luminosity and Age with eROSITA Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate stellar dating provides crucial information about the formation and development of planetary systems. Existing age-dating techniques are limited in terms of both the spectral type and age range they can accurately probe, and many are unreliable for stars older than 1 Gyr. Recent studies have suggested that a star's X-ray luminosity correlates strongly with stellar age and shows a steep fall-off at ages older than 1 Gyr. In this work, we present X-ray luminosity relationship values from eROSITA for four previously unassessed stars. Additionally, we reassess the X-ray luminosity/age relationship present in 24 main-sequence stars older than a gigayear. We confirm that a correlation does appear to exist between stellar age and X-ray luminosity at ages older than 1 Gyr. However, we measure a shallower slope with age than previous research for older stars, similar to what was found for younger stars. We also find evidence for significant astrophysical variability in a star's X-ray luminosity, which will likely limit the precision with which X-ray measurements can yield age estimates. We also find weak evidence for mass dependence in the X-ray luminosity/age relationship. These results suggest that although X-ray luminosity correlates with stellar age, it may not serve as a reliable standalone age indicator and is better used as part of a broader suite of age-dating methods.</description>

      <title>Stellar spin in young star clusters: comparison between simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular momentum evolution of stars is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of stars and star clusters. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star formation in clouds with different physical properties, we study the initial distribution of stellar rotation periods in young clusters. We compare these results with observations of young Galactic clusters. Simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed trend of increasing rotation period with stellar mass. Additionally, simulations with lower virial parameter (ratio of turbulence to gravity) or solenoidal turbulence driving produce period-mass distributions that more closely match the observed ones. These simulations also recover the break in the mass-period relation. However, the break appears at higher masses than in observations and is absent in the youngest simulated clusters. This suggests that the emergence of the break is an important diagnostic of angular momentum evolution during the earliest stages of cluster formation.
  The simulations yield stars that rotate about an order of magnitude faster than those observed. This discrepancy mainly reflects the earlier evolutionary stage of the simulations, while unresolved physical interactions between stars and discs might also contribute. This conclusion is supported by simulations showing a significant period increase within 0.1-1 Myr. We quantify the required angular-momentum loss by rescaling simulated rotation periods to match observations, finding that 80-95% of the initial angular momentum must be removed within the first Myr. Our results highlight that understanding the earliest stages of star cluster formation is fundamental to addressing the angular momentum problem.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Space- and Ground-based Monitoring of Accretion Bursts in a Protoplanetary Disk: The Orbital and Accretion Properties of DQ Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicity in pre-main-sequence (PMS) systems shapes circumstellar and circumbinary disks, often producing features such as inner cavities, spiral arms, and gas streamers that facilitate mass transfer between the disk and stars. Consequently, accretion in eccentric close binaries is highly variable and synchronized with their orbits, producing bursts near periastron passages. In this study, we examine the orbital and accretion properties of the eccentric Classical T-Tauri binary DQ Tau using medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-Shooter and UVES instruments. The data were taken during a monitoring of inner disk chemistry with JWST, and our analysis is needed for correct interpretation of JWST data. We refine the orbital parameters and report an increment in the argument of periastron of 30 degrees. This apsidal motion may be caused by the massive disk acting as a third body. We also explore the possibility that it is due to a still undetected additional (sub-)stellar companion, estimating a lower limit of 15 MJ for its mass at the cavity edge (a=3 abin). We investigate accretion of the primary and secondary using the Ca II 849.8 nm emission line. The primary accretes more at periastron than in previous quiescent phases, while the secondary dominates post-periastron. Additionally, we report elevated Lacc at apastron, possibly due to interaction with irregularly shaped structures near the closest approach to the circumbinary disk. Finally, we derive each star's accretion luminosity across disentangled epochs and compare it to UV-excess-based results, finding good agreement. The individual Lacc values can be used as input for chemical models.</description>

      <title>Effect of gravity darkening and oblate factor in rapidly rotating massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Rapid rotation in massive stars leads to gravity darkening and oblateness, significantly affecting their radiation-driven winds. These effects can alter wind dynamics and play a role in forming slowly equatorial outflowing winds. Aims. This work investigates the transition region where the fast solution (i.e. high terminal velocities) of radiation-driven winds in a massive rotating star, in the frame of the modified-CAK theory, switches to the Omega-slow solutions (a denser and slower wind) when the effects of gravity darkening and oblateness are considered. This Omega-slow solution appears when the rotational speed is higher and equal to 75% of the critical rotation speed. Methods. To explore the transition region for various equatorial models of B-type stars, we focus on the co-existence interval where both solutions simultaneously exist and the transition point where fast solutions switch to Omega-slow solutions. Results. Using our stationary numerical code Hydwind, we first analyse the individual effects of gravity darkening and stellar oblateness caused by high rotational speeds and then examine their combined impact on the wind solutions. Conclusions. We find that for a certain range of rotational speeds, both the fast and Omega-slow solutions can co-exist, and the co-existence range strongly depends on the initial conditions. When only gravity darkening is considered, the co-existing interval shifts towards higher rotational speeds. While in the presence of the oblateness, the co-existing interval also occurs at higher rotational speeds; however, it is less than the gravity darkening effect. We also explored how line-force parameters affect the critical point, the location of the co-existing interval, and where the solution switches.</description>

      <title>Stellar cycle variability in Mount Wilson stars and dynamo models: Rotation rate and dynamo number dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to the solar cycle, the magnetic cycles of other solar-type stars are also variable. How the variability of the stellar cycle changes with the rotation rate or the dynamo number is a valuable information for understanding the stellar dynamo process. We examine the variability in the stellar magnetic cycles by studying 81 stars from the data of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which started observations in 1966. For 28 stars, we have time series data available till 2003, while for others, the data are limited till 1995. We specifically explore how the variability changes with respect to three rotation-related parameters. We find a modest positive correlation between the variability and the stellar rotation period. In addition, we find suggestive negative correlations between the variability and the inverse squared Rossby number ($Ro^{-2}$), and the ratio of the mean cycle duration and rotation period ($\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$). Variability computed from the magnetic field of stellar dynamo models also show similar trends. Finally, inspired by previous studies, we examine dynamo number scaling in our model data and find that $Ro^{-0.6}$ (instead of $Ro^{-2}$ as suggested in the linear $\alpha \Omega$ dynamo theory) and $(\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle /P_{\rm rot})^{0.6}$ (instead of $\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$ as predicted in previous observations) are a good measure of the dynamo number. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the stellar magnetic cycle variability decreases with the increase of the rotation rate or the dynamo number.</description>

      <title>Growth of Metal-Enriched Supermassive Stars by Accretion and Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) may explain both the early emergence of supermassive black holes and the unusual abundance patterns observed in young galaxies and globular clusters. They are traditionally associated with primordial ``direct collapse'' at very low metallicity, but recent studies indicate that SMSs can also form in metal-enriched environments alongside numerous low-mass stars. We present detailed evolutionary models of SMSs with metallicities \(Z/Z_\odot = 10^{-5}\)--\(10^{-2}\), computed using \textsc{GENEC} and consistent with protostellar growth rates derived from cluster-collapse simulations. The final masses reach \(\sim7.2\times10^{4}\,M_\odot\) at \(10^{-5}\,Z_\odot\) and \(\sim2.3\times10^{3}\,M_\odot\) at \(10^{-2}\,Z_\odot\) through gas accretion and stellar collisions. Each model is evolved through the pre-main-sequence and core-hydrogen-burning phases, terminating either at the onset of general-relativistic instability \(Z\lesssim10^{-4}\,Z\) or at core-helium exhaustion for \(Z\gtrsim10^{-3}\,Z\). The dominant growth mode transitions from collision-dominated to accretion-limited between \(Z = 10^{-4}\) and \(10^{-3}\), while stellar lifetimes remain nearly constant at \(1.8\)--\(2.0\) Myr. We find that even in extreme cases, when additional hydrogen supplied by collisions amounts to \(\sim4.7\times10^{4}\,M_\odot\), the lifetime is only extended by \(\sim0.6\) Myr. During core-hydrogen burning, the critical accretion rate required to maintain the supergiant phase along the Hayashi line (\(\dot{M}_{\mathrm{crit}}\)) decreases as nuclear fuel is consumed, reducing UV emissivity and feedback efficiency. This facilitates SMS formation in a broader range of environments than previously expected, including those with metallicities up to \(Z \simeq 0.01\,Z_\odot\), typical of globular clusters.</description>

Abstract: The Roman Galactic Plane Survey (RGPS) is a 700-hour program approved for early definition as a community-designed General Astrophysics Survey. It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|&lt;2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) and Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), with coverage in seven filters and repeat observations in one or more filters with cadences from 11 minutes to weeks, and (3) a deep-field/spectroscopic science element (4 sq deg , 30 hrs) consisting of fifteen Roman pointings (with a wide range of extinction, diffuse emission, stellar density and population) using longer exposure times in seven filters in addition to grism and prism observations. This document summarizes the science that can be done with this survey, the process of survey definition, and details on all of the program elements.</description>

      <title>Using Stellar Spectral Energy Distributions to Measure Exoplanet Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to make accurate determinations of planetary parameters is inextricably linked to measuring physical parameters of the host star, in particular the stellar radius. In this paper we fit the stellar spectral energy distributions of exoplanet hosts to measure their radii, making use of only archival photometry, the $Gaia$ parallaxes and $Gaia$ extinction maps. Using the extinction maps frees us of the degeneracy between temperature and extinction which has plagued this method in the past. The resulting radii have typical random uncertainties of about 2 per cent. We perform a quantitative study of systematic uncertainties affecting the methodology and find they are similar to, or smaller than, the random ones. We discuss how the stellar parameters can be used to derive the properties of both transiting exoplanets, and those where only a radial-velocity curve is available. We then explore in detail the improvements the method makes possible for the parameters of the PanCET sample of transiting planets. For this sample we find the best literature measurements of the planetary radii have mean uncertainties about 40 per cent larger than those presented here, with the new measurements achieving precisions of 2 per cent in radius and 10 per cent in mass. In contrast to much recent work, these transiting exoplanets parameters are derived without using theoretical models of stellar interiors, freeing them of the assumptions those models contain, and any priors for stellar age. As the data used are available for the whole sky, the method can be used for self-consistent measurements of the planetary parameters of a very large fraction of known exoplanets.</description>

      <title>General Implicit Runge-Kutta Integrators for Multifluid Gas-Dust Aerodynamic Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of aerodynamic drag is a fundamental step in simulating dust dynamics in hydrodynamical simulations. We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exoplanets Born Outside the Milky Way: VOYAGERS Survey Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations over the past few decades have found that planets are common around nearby stars in our Galaxy, but little is known about planets that formed outside the Milky Way. We describe the design and early implementation of a survey to test whether planets also exist orbiting the remnant stars of ancient dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way, and if so, how they differ from their Milky Way counterparts. VOYAGERS (Views Of Yore - Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey) is a radial velocity (RV) search using precision spectrographs to discover exoplanets orbiting very low metallicity ($-2.8 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \leq -0.8$) stars born in the dwarf galaxy Enceladus, which merged with the Milky Way galaxy about 10 Gyr ago. A sample of 22 candidates have been screened from a catalog of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) members using a combination of stellar properties and reconnaissance observations from the TRES spectrograph. Precision RV measurements have been initiated using the NEID, HARPS-N, and CARMENES spectrographs. We plan to focus most upcoming observations on 10 main sequence targets. Data collection is well underway, with 778 observations on 22 candidates (385 of which are 10 focus targets), but far from complete. This survey is designed to be sensitive to sub-Neptune mass planets with periods up to hundreds of days. We note that the RV analysis gives mass multiplied by $\sin (inclination)$ or the minimum mass for exoplanets. The expected survey yield is three planets, assuming that occurrence rates are similar to those in the Milky Way and taking into account the degeneracy with inclination in our yield models. Our survey is designed to detect at least one exoplanet if occurrence rates are similar to known Milky Way exoplanets or, if no exoplanets are discovered, to rule out a Milky Way-like planet population in GES with 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Rotating Stellar Surfaces from Astrometric Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry measures shifts in a star's photocentre and can be used to detect reflex motion due to orbiting exoplanets. Brightness asymmetries (e.g. starspots) rotating in and out of view can also cause apparent motion of the photocenter, termed astrometric jitter, that has previously been considered a source of noise. Here, we explore whether it can be used to map stellar surfaces. We derive a Cramer-Rao bound on the minimum variance for which a stellar surface can theoretically be estimated, quantifying the information content in rotational astrometric jitter. To regularize and break singularities in the Fisher information, we impose a spatial-smoothness Gaussian-Markov random field prior. A key challenge in mapping surfaces arises for stars with unknown rotational axis inclinations, requiring joint estimation of the inclination and the stellar surface. We characterize the coupling between them and quantify the precision gain when inclination is known versus unknown.</description>

      <title>Investigating star formation scenarios in the Milky Way using YSO distributions - A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%). The number of Class II stars is relatively high and increases from the Inner regions (52.64 +- 10.07%) to Outer regions (64.54 +- 11.09%). These nine star-forming regions are not an accurate representation of locations throughout the Galaxy and the results may be biased.</description>

Abstract: We give a general overview of what the scientific community refers to as "exocomets". The general definition of exocomets, as presented in this work, is discussed and compared with Solar System comets and interstellar objects, addressing their detection around main-sequence stars as well as orbiting white dwarfs. We introduce the different types of exocomet observations, highlighting the difference between exocometary 'bodies' and exocometary 'material'. We provide a census of all exocometary system candidates detected so far, both via spectroscopy and photometry, including detections around white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Isolated massive star candidates in NGC 4242 with GULP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Context.}$ There is considerable debate on how massive stars form, including whether a high-mass star must always form with a population of low-mass stars or whether it can also form in isolation. Massive stars found in the field are often considered to be runaways from star clusters or OB associations. However, there is evidence in the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud of high-mass stars that appear isolated in the field and cannot be related to any known star cluster or OB association. Studies of more distant galaxies have been lacking so far. $\textit{Aims.}$ In this work, we identified massive star candidates that appear isolated in the field of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4242 (distance: 5.3 Mpc), to explore how many candidates for isolated star formation we find in a galaxy outside the Local Group. $\textit{Methods.}$ We identified 234 massive ($M_{ini}\geq15M_{\odot}$) and young ($\leq 10$ Myr) field stars in NGC 4242 using the Hubble Space Telescope's Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the UVIS channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 from the Galaxy UV Legacy Project (GULP) and optical data from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We investigated the surroundings of our targets within the range of projected distances expected for runaway stars, $74$ pc and $204$ pc. $\textit{Results.}$ We find that between $9.8\%$ and $34.6\%$ of our targets have no young stellar groups or massive stars within the threshold radii, making them appear isolated. This fraction reduces to $3.2\%-11.5\%$ when we consider the total number of massive stars expected from the observed UV star formation rate. $\textit{Conclusions.}$ Our results show that there is a small population of young and massive, potentially isolated field stars in NGC 4242.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the Solar Wind Before It Reaches L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather predictions of the solar wind impacting Earth are usually first based on remote-sensing observations of the solar disc and corona, and eventually validated and/or refined with in-situ measurements taken at the Sun$-$Earth Lagrange L1 point, where real-time monitoring probes are located. However, this pipeline provides, on average, only a few tens of minutes of lead time, which decreases to $\sim$30 minutes or less for large solar wind speeds of $\sim$800 km/s and above. The G5 geomagnetic storm of 2024 May provided an opportunity to test predictions generated employing real-time data from the STEREO-A spacecraft, placed 13{\deg} west of Earth and 0.04 au closer to the Sun than L1 at the time of the event, as shown recently by Weiler et al. (2025). In this Commentary, we contextualise these results to reflect upon the advantages of measuring the solar wind in situ upstream of L1, leading to improvements in both fundamental research of interplanetary physics and space weather predictions of the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>A Simple Ray Acceleration Structure for Non-LTE Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel ray acceleration structure for radiative transfer outside of local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), leveraging techniques from computer graphics to improve computational efficiency. By applying mipmapping (local recursive spatial averaging) and sparse voxel grids, we exploit spatial coherence and sparsity in astrophysical models to accelerate the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called "Core and Voigt". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 % error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations. These methods are implemented in the DexRT code and demonstrate significant performance gains in realistic solar atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Energetic Particles from Quasi-Separatrix Layers and Current Sheets at the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) at the Sun are created from regions where channels of open magnetic flux have footpoints near regions of large-scale closed magnetic flux. These regions are particularly prone to magnetic reconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common sources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal distributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle acceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further investigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the QSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near the QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn accelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material previously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often rich in heavy ions and $^3$He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations. Therefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in $^3$He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic particles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our results provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which likely have $^3$He and heavy ion enhancements. These results aid in the development of predictive solar energetic particle models.</description>

      <title>Supergranulation and Poleward Migration of the Magnetic Field at High Latitudes of the Sun</title>

Abstract: Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40 Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20 m s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects in Upper Scorpius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging in several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin but are currently limited by the small sample sizes explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method, which models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling a statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explored disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This shift in trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</description>

      <title>Insights into Planet Formation from the Ages, Masses, and Elemental Abundances of Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How planetary systems form and evolve is a key question in astronomy. Revealing how host star properties, such as elemental abundances, age, and mass, differ from those of non-host stars, and how they correlate with planetary characteristics such as radius, provides new insights into the formation and evolutionary pathways of planetary systems. We determine precise ages for 18890 dwarfs and subgiants from the LAMOST-Kepler-Gaia sample with a mean age uncertainty of about 15 percent (median about 10 percent). Within the framework of Galactic chemical evolution, we find that about 86 percent of planet-hosting stars younger than 8 Gyr occupy the upper branch ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.2) of the characteristic V-shaped age-metallicity relation of the Galactic disk. Based on guiding radii (Rg), we further infer that about 19 percent of these young hosts likely originated in the inner disk and subsequently migrated to the solar neighborhood. Among stars older than 10 Gyr, host stars tend to be more metal-rich, with nearly 59 percent having [Fe/H] &gt; -0.2. This suggests that both young and old planet-hosting stars preferentially form in relatively metal-rich environments. However, for host stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.2, we find that their metallicities are on average lower by about 0.16 dex compared to non-host stars of similar age and mass, indicating that [Fe/H] is unlikely to be the dominant factor governing planet formation in metal-poor environments. We also identify a systematic depletion of volatile elements, especially carbon, in planet hosts. Moreover, host star [Fe/H] exhibits a weak correlation with planet radius, while [alpha/Fe] primarily support the formation of small planets.</description>

      <title>Using ML-based Regression Techniques to Mitigate GOES Energetic Proton Flux Data Contamination and Magnetospheric Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positioned at geostationary orbit (GEO) ~36,000 km above Earth, NOAA's GOES series has recorded real-time energetic proton flux measurements crucial for space weather monitoring for over three decades. Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.</description>

      <title>The Triple System V1371 Tau: An Eclipsing Binary with an Outer Be Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although triple systems are common, their orbital dynamics and stellar evolution remain poorly understood. We investigated the V1371 Tau system using TESS photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and recent interferometric data, confirming it as a rare triple system consisting of an eclipsing binary orbited by a classical Be star, with a spectral classification of (B1V + B0V) + B0Ve. The eclipsing binary exhibits an orbital period of approximately 34 days, and the Be star orbits the inner pair on a timescale of a few years. Weak H$\alpha$ emission lines suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk with variability on a timescale of months around the Be star, and a nearly constant V/R ratio with no detectable asymmetry variations. Besides the eclipses, frequencies at 0.24 and 0.26 c/d dominate the photometric variability. Higher-frequency signals are present which appear associated with non-radial pulsation. The eclipsing pair ($i \approx 90^\circ$) shows projected rotational velocities of 160 and 200 km s$^{-1}$. The Be star's measured $v \sin i \approx 250$ km s$^{-1}$ implies a critical rotation fraction between 0.44 and 0.76 for plausible inclinations, significantly faster than the eclipsing components. The shallower eclipses in the KELT data compared to TESS suggest a variation in orbital inclination, possibly induced by Kozai-Lidov cycles from the outer Be star. The evolution analysis suggests that all components are massive main-sequence stars, with the secondary star in the eclipsing binary being overluminous. This study emphasizes the complexity of triple systems with Be stars and provides a basis for future research on their formation, evolution, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>LRPayne: Stellar parameters and abundances from low-resolution spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. This paper introduces LRPayne, a novel algorithm designed for the efficient determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances from low-resolution optical spectra, with a primary focus on data from large-scale galactic surveys such as WEAVE. Methods. LRPayne employs a model-driven approach, utilising a fully connected artificial neural network (ANN), trained on a library of 70,000 synthetic stellar spectra generated using iSpec with 1D MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum synthesis code. The network is trained to predict normalized flux given stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], vmic, vmax and v sin i, and 24 individual elemental abundances). Stellar parameters are subsequently derived from observed spectra by finding the best-fit synthetic spectrum from the ANN using a chi-squared minimisation technique. The method operates on spectra degraded to a resolution of R=5000 covering the wavelength range 4200-6900 {\AA}. Results. Internal accuracy tests on synthetic spectra show a median interpolation error of less than 0.13 % for 90 % of the validation sample. The method accurately recovers most input labels from synthetic spectra, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 20, with some expected challenges for elements like Li, K, and N. Validation on observed spectra of 25 Gaia FGK benchmark stars and 42 metal-poor stars reveals good agreement with literature values. For stellar parameters, mean differences are 22+-87 K for Teff , 0.19+-0.23 dex for log(g), and 0.01+-0.17 dex for [Fe/H]. Abundances for elements like Na, Mg, Si, and most Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni, V, Sc) are well-recovered. Challenges are noted for oxygen, manganese in metal-rich giants, aluminium in metal-poor stars and dwarfs, and for deriving log g in hot metal-poor dwarfs, partly due to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects and line characteristics.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The PICS Project: II. Circumnebular extinction variations and their effect on the planetary nebula luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). The brightest younger PN populations have been observed to be fainter in their [O III] emission than expected. Recent studies have proposed that circumnebular extinction is a key ingredient in bringing their brightness down to the observed level. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>Recoil-Enabled Energy Transfer from Coherent Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</description>
