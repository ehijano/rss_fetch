      <title>An identity involving counts of binary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the proposition shown below and explore some of its consequences. For a sequence $p=(p_1,p_2,\dots)$ of non-negative integers, set $|p| = \sum_{i\geq 1} p_i$ and let $[p] = (\#\{j: p_j=i\})_{i\geq 1}$ count the number of occurrences of $i\geq 1$ in $p$, so that $|[p]|$ is the number of non-zero elements in $p$. For $p\in \mathbb N_0^\infty$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, we write $p!$ and $x^{\underline{p}}$ for the product of factorials $\prod_{i\geq 1}p_i!$ and of falling factorials $\prod_{i\geq 1} x^{\underline{p_i}}$, respectively. If $p$ is an integer partition of $m$, i.e., if $|p|=m$ and $p_1\geq p_2 \geq \dots$, we write $p \vdash m$. Given two integer partitions $p$ and $q$ of $m$, let $N(p,q)$ denote the number of $|[p]|\times |[q]|$ binary matrices whose row-and column-sums equal $p$ and $q$, respectively (for $m=0$, this number is to be interpreted as one).
  Proposition: For $q \vdash m$ and $x\in \mathbb R$, we have $$\sum_{p \vdash m} \frac{x^{\underline{|[p]|}}}{[p]!} N(p,q) \quad=\quad \frac{x^{\underline{q}}}{q!}.$$</description>

      <title>Matroid adjoints and the minimum rank of zero-nonzero matrix patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the minimum rank of a matrix with a given zero-nonzero pattern has been generalized to a class of matroids associated to the pattern. The fundamental lower bound known as the triangle number still holds in this generalized setting. But the matroid minimum rank of a pattern need not match that of its transpose.
  We associate to each pattern $X$ a lattice $L(X)$. We define the fundamental pattern of a matroid $M$ to be the complement of its hyperplane-point incidence pattern and note that when $X$ is the fundamental pattern of $M$, the lattice of flats of $M$ is $L(X)$. We then prove that, for every pattern $X$, the dual lattice of $L(X)$ is isomorphic to $L(X^T)$.
  We show that a matroid $M'$ of the same rank as $M$ is an adjoint of $M$ if and only if $M'$ is associated with the transpose of the fundamental pattern of $M$. Our main result ties together the notion of a matroid adjoint with the phenomenon of a gap between the triangle number $k$ and the matroid minimum rank of a pattern. Namely, we show that, if any matroid of rank $k$ associated with a pattern has an adjoint, then there is no such gap for the pattern's transpose.
  We show that the matroid of minimum rank associated with the fundamental pattern is unique. Using this, we prove that the matrix minimum rank of the fundamental pattern of a matroid over different fields depends on the representability of the matroid over those fields. This allows us to recover and improve upon a construction of Berman et al. We also give a smaller example than any previously known of a pattern with a matroid minimum rank smaller than its matrix minimum rank over every field. Finally, we establish that, for the fundamental pattern, a converse holds to our main result. In particular, a matroid with fundamental pattern $X$ has an adjoint if and only if the matroid minimum rank of $X^T$ is equal to its triangle number.</description>

      <title>Graphs with asymmetric Ramsey properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $k$ and $\ell$ we write $G \rightarrow (K_k,K_\ell)$ if every 2-colouring of the edges of $G$ yields a red copy of $K_k$ or a blue copy of $K_\ell$ and we denote by $R(k)$ the minimum $n$ such that $K_n\rightarrow (K_k,K_k)$. By using probabilistic methods and hypergraph containers we prove that for every integer $k \geq 3$, there exists a graph $G$ such that $G \nrightarrow (K_k,K_k)$ and $G \rightarrow (K_{R(k)-1},K_{k-1})$. This result can be viewed as a variation of a classical theorem of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl [The Ramsey property for graphs with forbidden complete subgraphs, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 20 (1976), 243-249], who proved that for every integer $k\geq 2$ there exists a graph $G$ with no copies of $K_k$ such that $G\rightarrow(K_{k-1}, K_{k-1})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to see how commuting graphs interact with two semigroup constructions: the zero-union and the direct product. For both semigroup constructions, we investigate the diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree of their commuting graphs and, when possible, we exhibit the relationship between each one of these properties and the corresponding properties of the commuting graphs of the original semigroups.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers of rank-two Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected Cayley graph for an Abelian group generated by a finite symmetric subset $S$ can be represented by an integer matrix, its Heuberger matrix. We call the number of columns of that matrix its rank and the number of rows its dimension. Several previous papers have dealt with the question of finding a formula for the chromatic number of an Abelian Cayley graph in terms of an associated Heuberger matrix. In this paper, we fully resolve this matter for all integer matrices of rank $\leq 2$. Prior results provide such formulas when the rank is 1, as well as when the rank is 2 and the dimension is no more than 4. Here, we complete the picture for the rank-two case by showing that when the rank is 2 and the dimension is at least 5, then the chromatic number equals 3 unless the graph has loops (in which case it is uncolorable); the graph is bipartite (in which case the chromatic number is 2); or the matrix has a zero row (in which case, the chromatic number does not change when that row is deleted).</description>

      <title>A partial order on the 240 packings of PG(3,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the most symmetrical solutions of Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem can be constructed from the $240$ packings of the projective space $PG(3, 2)$, but it seems to have escaped notice that these packings have the structure of a partially ordered set. In this paper, we construct a shellable Bruhat-like graded partial order on the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ that refines the partial order on the product of four chains $[8]\times[5]\times[3]\times[2]$ and defines a Lehmer code on the packings. The partial order exists because the packings of $PG(3, 2)$ form a quasiparabolic set (in the sense of Rains--Vazirani) that is in bijective correspondence with a certain collection of maximal orthogonal subsets of the $E_8$ root system. The $E_8$ construction also induces transitive actions of the Weyl groups of type $D_n$ on the packings for $5 \leq n \leq 8$, and these actions are faithful for $n &lt; 8$. It is possible to define both the signed permutation action and the partial order using the combinatorics of labelled Fano planes.</description>

      <title>Polynomials Arising from Sorted Binomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triangle of sorted binomial coefficients $\left\langle {n \atop k} \right\rangle = \binom{n}{\lfloor \frac{n - k}{2} \rfloor}$ for $0 \leq k \leq n$ has appeared several times in recent combinatorial works but has evaded dedicated study. Here we refer to $\left\langle {n \atop k} \right\rangle$ as the Pascalian numbers and unify the various perspectives of $\left\langle {n \atop k} \right\rangle$. We then view each row of the $\left\langle {n \atop k} \right\rangle$ triangle as the coefficients of the $n$th Pascalian polynomial, which we denote $P_n(z)$. We derive recursions, formulae, and bounds on $P_n(z)$'s roots in $\mathbb{C}$, and characterize the asymptotics of these roots. We show the roots of $P_n(z)$ converge uniformly to a curve $\partial \Gamma \subset \mathbb{C}$ and asymptotically fill the curve densely. We conclude with a discussion of the reducibility and Galois groups of $P_n(z)$. Our work has natural connections to the truncated binomial polynomials, asymptotic analysis, and well-known integer families.</description>

      <title>Cycle lengths in graphs of given minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph, $k$ cycles are {\em admissible} if their lengths form an arithmetic progression with common difference one or two. Let $G$ be a 2-connected graph with minimum degree at least $k\geqslant 4$. We prove that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item [(1)] $G$ contains $k$ admissible cycles, unless $G\cong K_{k+1}$ or $K_{k,n-k}$;
  \item [(2)] $G$ contains cycles of lengths $\ell$ modulo $k$ for all even $\ell$, unless $G\cong K_{k+1}$ or $K_{k,n-k}$;
  \item [(3)] $G$ contains cycles of lengths $\ell$ modulo $k$ for all $\ell$, unless $G\cong K_{k+1}$ or $G$ is bipartite.
  \end{itemize} In addition, we show that if $k$ is even and $G$ is 2-connected with minimum degree at least $k-1$ and order at least $k+2$, then $G$ contains cycles of lengths $\ell$ modulo $k$ for all even $\ell$. These findings provide a stability analysis of the main results on cycle lengths in graphs of given minimum degree in [J. Gao, Q. Huo, C. Liu, J. Ma, A unified proof of conjectures on cycle lengths in graphs, International Mathematics Research Notices 2022 (10) (2022) 7615--7653]. As a corollary, we determine the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain a cycle of length 0 modulo $k$ for all odd $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be two matroids on the same ground set $V$. Let $A_1,\dots,A_{2n-1}$ be sets which are independent in both $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, satisfying $|A_i|\geq \textrm{min}(i,n)$ for all $i$. We show that there exists a partial rainbow set of size $n$, which is independent in both $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$. This is a common generalization of rainbow matching results for bipartite graphs by Aharoni, Berger, Kotlar, and Ziv, and for the intersection of two matroid by Kotlar and Ziv.</description>

      <title>The structure of $\Delta(1, 2, 2)$-free tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the list of tournaments $S$ for which the complete structural description for tournaments excluding $S$ as a subtournament is known. Specifically, let $\Delta(1, 2, 2)$ be a tournament on five vertices obtained from a cyclic triangle by substituting a two-vertex tournament for two of its vertices. In this paper, we show that tournaments excluding $\Delta(1, 2, 2)$ as a subtournament are either isomorphic to one of three small tournaments, obtained from a transitive tournament by reversing edges in vertex-disjoint directed paths, or obtained from a smaller tournament with the same property by applying one of two operations. In particular, one of these operations creates a homogeneous set that induces a subtournament isomorphic to one of three fixed tournaments, and the other creates a homogeneous pair such that their union induces a subtournament isomorphic to a fixed tournament. As an application of this result, we present an upper bound for the chromatic number, a lower bound for the size of a largest transitive subtournament, and a lower bound for the number of vertex-disjoint cyclic triangles for such tournaments. The bounds that we present are all best possible.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture to signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balanced chromatic number of a signed graph G is the minimum number of balanced sets that cover all vertices of G. Studying structural conditions which imply bounds on the balanced chromatic number of signed graphs is among the most fundamental problems in graph theory. In this work, we initiate the study of coloring hereditary classes of signed graphs. More precisely, we say that a set F = {F_1, F_2, ..., F_l} is a GS (for Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner) set if there exists a constant c such that signed graphs with no induced subgraph switching equivalent to a member of F admit a balanced c-coloring. The focus of this work is to study GS sets of order 2. We show that if F is a GS set of order 2, then F_1 is either (K_3, -) or (K_4, -), and F_2 is a linear forest. In the case of F_1 = (K_3, -), we show that any choice of a linear forest for F_2 works. In the case of F_1 = (K_4, -), we show that if each connected component of F_2 is a path of length at most 4, then {F_1, F_2} is a GS set.</description>

      <title>Terracini matroids: algebraic matroids of secants and embedded joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applications of algebraic geometry have sparked much recent work on algebraic matroids. An algebraic matroid encodes algebraic dependencies among coordinate functions on a variety.
  We study the behavior of algebraic matroids under joins and secants of varieties. Motivated by Terracini's lemma, we introduce the notion of a Terracini union of matroids, which captures when the algebraic matroid of a join coincides with the matroid union of the algebraic matroids of its summands. We illustrate applications of our results with a discussion of the implications for toric surfaces and threefolds.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture on the maximum number of equiangular lines with a common angle $\arccos(1/5)$. This conjecture was previously resolved by Cao, Koolen, Lin, and Yu in 2022 through an analysis involving forbidden subgraphs for the smallest Seidel eigenvalue $-5$. Our new proof is based on bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities of graphs with degree no larger than $14$. To control the maximum degree of the graph associated with equiangular lines, we employ a recent inequality of Balla derived by matrix projection techniques. Our strategy also leads to a new proof for the classical result obtained by Lemmens and Seidel in 1973 for the case where the common angle is $\arccos(1/3)$.</description>

      <title>Chords of longest cycles in graphs with large circumferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture of Thomassen says that every longest cycle of a $3$-connected graph has a chord. Thomassen (2018) proved that if $G$ is a $2$-connected cubic graph, then any longest cycle must have a chord. He also showed that in any 3-connected graph with minimum degree at least four, some longest cycle must contain a chord. Harvey proved that every longest cycle has a chord for graphs with a large minimum degree. He also conjectured that any longest cycle in a 2-connected graph with minimum degree at least three has a chord. In this paper, we prove that both Thomassen's and Harvey's conjectures are true for graphs with large circumferences. We also prove a more general result for the existence of chords in longest cycles containing a linear forest.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a spectral theory for hypergraph limits. We prove the convergence of the spectra of adjacency and Laplacian matrices for hypergraph sequences converging in the $1$-cut metric. On the other hand, we give examples of matrix operators associated with hypergraphs whose spectra are not continuous with respect to the $1$-cut metric. Furthermore, we show that these operators are continuous with respect to other cut norms.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to statements on isometric graph coverings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected subgraph of a graph is isometric if it preserves distances. In this short note, we provide counterexamples to several variants of the following general question: When a graph $G$ is edge covered by connected isometric subgraphs $H_1,\dots,H_k$, which properties of $G$ can we infer from properties of $H_1,\dots,H_k$? For example, Dumas, Foucaud, Perez and Todinca (SIDMA, 2024) proved that when $H_1,\dots,H_k$ are paths, then the pathwidth of $G$ is bounded in terms of $k$. Among others, we show that there are graphs of arbitrarily large treewidth that can be isometrically edge covered by four trees.</description>

      <title>Rational normal curves as no-$(d+2)$-on-$Q$-quadric sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $d\geq 2$, we construct a subset $D\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,n\}^d$ of size $n-o(n)$ such that every affine hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^d$ intersects $D$ in at most $d$ points, and every hypersphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$ intersects $D$ in at most $d+1$ points. This construction is the largest one currently known, and strongly builds on ideas of Dong, Xu, and also of Thiele. More generally, we prove that the role of hyperspheres can be replaced by $Q$-quadrics, i.e. by quadratic surfaces given by an equation whose degree two homogeneous part equals a fixed quadratic form $Q$. We formulate analogous statements in affine spaces over (finite) fields. Essentially, every construction is given by a suitable rational normal curve in a $d$-dimensional projective space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the simplex faces of the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$ and the chain polytope $\mathcal{C}(P)$ of a finite poset $P$. We show that, if $P$ can be recursively constructed from $\mathbf{X}$-free posets using disjoint unions and ordinal sums, then $\mathcal{C}(P)$ has at least as many $k$-dimensional simplex faces as $\mathcal{O}(P)$ does, for each dimension $k$. This generalizes a previous result of Mori, both in terms of the dimensions of the simplices and in terms of the class of posets considered.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of undirected 2-quasi best match graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite best match graphs (BMG) and their generalizations arise in mathematical phylogenetics as combinatorial models describing evolutionary relationships among related genes in a pair of species. In this work, we characterize the class of \emph{undirected 2-quasi-BMGs} (un2qBMGs), which form a proper subclass of the $P_6$-free chordal bipartite graphs. We show that un2qBMGs are exactly the class of bipartite graphs free of $P_6$, $C_6$, and the eight-vertex Sunlet$_4$ graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph $G$ is un2qBMG if and only if every connected induced subgraph contains a ``heart-vertex'' which is adjacent to all the vertices of the opposite color. We further provide a $O(|V(G)|^3)$ algorithm for the recognition of un2qBMGs that, in the affirmative case, constructs a labeled rooted tree that ``explains'' $G$. Finally, since un2qBMGs coincide with the $(P_6,C_6)$-free bi-cographs, they can also be recognized in linear time.</description>

Abstract: Every graph G can be embedded in a Euclidean space as a two-distance set. This allows us to reformulate the analogue of Borsuk's conjecture for two-distance sets in terms of graphs. This conjecture remains open for dimensions from 4 to 63. This short note also discusses an approach for finding counterexamples using graphs, as well as its generalization for s-distance sets.</description>

      <title>Blossoming bijection for bipartite maps: a new approach via orientations and applications to the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03680v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new bijective framework for the enumeration of bipartite planar maps with control on the degree distribution of black and white vertices. Our approach builds on the blossoming-tree paradigm, introducing a family of orientations on bipartite maps that extends Eulerian and quasi-Eulerian orientations and connects the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer to the general scheme of Albenque and Poulalhon. This enables us to generalize the Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer's bijection to several families of bipartite maps.
  As an application, we also derive a rational and Lagrangian parametrization with positive integer coefficients for the generating series of quartic maps equipped with an Ising model, which is key to the probabilistic study of these maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Fulton's determinantal construction of Schur modules to the skew setting, providing an explicit and functorial presentation using only elementary linear algebra and determinantal identities, in parallel with the partition case. Building on the non-iterative straightening formula of the first author for partition shapes, we develop a non-iterative straightening algorithm for skew Schur modules that expresses arbitrary elements in a new D-basis with an explicit closed coefficient formula. We then show that this D-basis is the result of applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to the semistandard tableau basis, which identifies a natural inner product on the skew Schur module and recasts straightening as an orthogonal projection.</description>

      <title>Distance Exceptional Graphs and the Curvature Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices is said to be \emph{distance exceptional} if the equation $D\vec{x} = \vec{1}$ admits no solution $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, where $D\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the shortest path distance matrix of $G$. These graphs were first studied by Steinerberger in the context of a notion of discrete curvature (``Curvature on graphs via equilibrium measures,'' \emph{Journal of Graph Theory}, 103(3), 2023). This work has led to several open questions about distance exceptional graphs, including: What is the structure of such graphs? How can they be characterized? How rare are they? In this paper, we investigate these questions through the lens of a graph invariant we term the \emph{curvature index}. We show that a graph is distance exceptional if and only if this invariant vanishes, and we develop a calculus for this invariant under graph operations including the Cartesian product and graph join. As a result, we recover and generalize a number of known results in this area. We show that any graph $G$ can be realized as an induced subgraph of a distance exceptional graph $G'$. Moreover, in many cases, this embedding is an isometry. In turn, this leads to a number of methods for constructing distance exceptional graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlphaEvolve is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the AdditiveToricVarieties package for Macaulay2, a software system for algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, with methods for working with additive group actions on complete toric varieties. More precisely, we implement algorithms, based on results by Arzhantsev, Dzhunusov and Romaskevich, to determine whether a complete toric variety admits an action of the commutative unipotent group and whether it is unique or not. We also observe that every smooth complete toric variety of Picard rank two is additive. We apply our methods to the class of smooth Fano toric varieties and notably determine all such varieties of dimension up to 6 admitting an additive action.</description>

(2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339-356), that parallel important characterizations of the Shapley value.</description>

In this work, we prove the conjecture holds in full generality, i.e. for toric surfaces corresponding to h-transverse polygons. Furthermore, we define new combinatorial Welschinger-type numbers for h-transverse polygons and show that they are likewise piecewise quasipolynomial.</description>

Abstract: In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the second eigenspace of the interchange process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral gap theorem of Caputo, Liggett, and Richthammer states that on any connected graph equipped with edge weights, the 2nd eigenvalue of the interchange process equals the 2nd eigenvalue of the random walk process. In this work we characterize the 2nd eigenspace of the interchange process. We prove that this eigenspace is uniquely determined by the 2nd eigenvectors of the random walk process on every connected weighted graph except the $4$-cycle with uniform edge weights. The key to our proof is an induction scheme on the number of vertices, and involves the octopus (in)equality, representation theoretic computations, and graph Laplacian computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, first we give two formulae for the delta invariant of a complex curve singularity that can be embedded as a ${\mathbb Q}$-Cartier divisor in a normal surface singularity with rational homology sphere link. Next, we consider representable numerical semigroups, they are semigroups associated with normal weighted homogeneous surface singularities with rational homology sphere links (via the degrees of the homogeneous functions). We then prove that such a semigroup can be interpreted as the value semigroup of a generic orbit (as a curve singularity) given by the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action on the weighted homogeneous germ. Furthermore, we use the delta invariant formula to derive a combinatorially computable formula for the genus of representable semigroups. Finally, we characterize topologically those representable semigroups which are symmetric.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Given an positive integer $k$, let $n:=\binom{k+1}{2}$. In 2012, during a talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</description>

Abstract: We study the Ising model with an external magnetic field on random tetravalent planar maps and investigate its critical behavior. Explicit expressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed and the critical exponents $\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition), $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at zero external magnetic field) and $\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical temperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field using analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Strong Embeddings of 3-Connected Cubic Planar Graphs on Surfaces of non-negative Euler Characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whitney proved that 3-connected planar graphs admit a unique embedding on the sphere. In contrast, Enami investigated embeddings of 3-connected cubic planar graphs on non-spherical surfaces with non-negative Euler characteristic. He established that such an embedding exists if and only if the dual graph contains a particular subgraph. Here, strong embeddings are investigated motivated by the cycle double cover conjecture and the relation to triangulated surfaces. We provide a complete characterization of strong embeddings on the projective plane, the torus, and the Klein bottle in terms of a distinguished subset of Enami's subgraphs. This characterization not only deepens the structural understanding of graph embeddings on non-spherical surfaces, but also establishes a robust foundation for computing cycle double covers. As a direct consequence, we derive explicit criteria that determine when a graph does not admit a strong embedding on these surfaces-offering new tools for both theoretical analysis and algorithmic applications.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Symmetric Function for Unicyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of which structural properties of a graph can be recovered from the chromatic symmetric function (CSF), we study the CSF of connected unicyclic graphs. While it is known that there can be non-isomorphic unicyclic graphs with the same CSF, we find experimentally that such examples are rare for graphs with up to 17 vertices. In fact, in many cases we can recover data such as the number of leaves, number of internal edges, cycle size, and number of attached non-trivial trees, by extending known results for trees to unicyclic graphs. These results are obtained by analyzing the CSF of a connected unicyclic graph in the $\textit{star-basis}$ using the deletion-near-contraction (DNC) relation developed by Aliste-Prieto, Orellana and Zamora, and computing the "leading" partition, its coefficient, as well as coefficients indexed by hook partitions. We also give explicit formulas for star-expansions of several classes of graphs, developing methods for extracting coefficients using structural properties of the graph.</description>

      <title>On Pauling's residual entropy estimate for regular graphs with growing degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1935, Pauling proposed an estimate for the number of Eulerian orientations of a graph in the context of the theoretical behaviour of water ice. The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, normalised by the number of vertices, is called the residual entropy. In an earlier paper, we conjectured that the residual entropy of a sequence of regular graphs of increasing degree was asymptotically equal to Pauling's estimate. Here we prove the conjecture under constraints on the number of short circuits. These constraints hold under weak eigenvalue conditions and apply to sequences of increasing girth and repeated Cartesian products such as hypercubes.</description>

      <title>A weak regularity lemma for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A regularity lemma for polynomials provides a decomposition in terms of a bounded number of approximately independent polynomials. Such regularity lemmas play an important role in numerous results, yet suffer from the familiar shortcoming of having tower-type bounds or worse. In this paper we design a new, weaker regularity lemma with strong bounds. The new regularity lemma in particular provides means to quantitatively study the curves contained in the image of a polynomial map, which is beyond the reach of standard methods.
  Applications include strong bounds for a problem of Karam on generalized rank, as well as a new method to obtain upper bounds for fan-in parameters in arithmetic circuits. For example, we show that if the image of a polynomial map $\mathbf{P} \colon \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$ of degree $d$ does not contain a line, then $\mathbf{P}$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ arithmetic formula with bottom fan-in at most $d/2$ and top fan-in at most $(2m)^{C(d)}$ (with $C(d)=2^{(1+o(1))d}$). One implication of our work is a certain ``barrier'' to arithmetic circuit lower bounds, in terms of the smallest degree of a polynomial curve contained in the image of the given polynomial map.</description>

      <title>Vu's conjecture holds for claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\Delta_2(G)$ denote the maximum number of neighbors any two distinct vertices of $G$ have in common. Vu (2002) proposed that, provided $\Delta_2(G)$ is not too small as a proportion of the maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ of $G$, the chromatic number of $G$ should never be too much larger than $\Delta_2(G)$. We make a first approach towards Vu's conjecture from a structural graph theoretic point of view. We prove that, in the case where $G$ is claw-free, indeed the chromatic number of $G$ is at most $\Delta_2(G)+3$. This is tight, as our bound is met with equality for the line graph of the Petersen graph. Moreover, we can prove this in terms of the more specific parameter that bounds the maximum number of neighbors any two endpoints of some edge of $G$ have in common. Our result may be viewed as a generalization of the classic bound of Vizing (1964) for edge-coloring.</description>

      <title>A Tverberg-type problem of Kalai: Two negative answers to questions of Alon and Smorodinsky, and the power of disjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote the least integer $n$ such that every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a partition $P=P_1\cup\cdots\cup P_r$ with the property that for any choice of $s_i$-convex sets $C_i\supseteq P_i$ $(i\in[r])$ one necessarily has $\bigcap_{i=1}^r C_i\neq\emptyset$, where an $s_i$-convex set means a union of $s_i$ convex sets. A recent breakthrough by Alon and Smorodinsky establishes a general upper bound $f_r(d,s_1,\dots,s_r) = O(dr^2\log r \prod_{i=1}^r s_i\cdot \log(\prod_{i=1}^r s_i).$ Specializing to $r=2$ resolves the problem of Kalai from the 1970s. They further singled out two particularly intriguing questions: whether $f_{2}(2,s,s)$ can be improved from $O(s^2\log s)$ to $O(s)$, and whether $f_r(d,s,\ldots,s)\le Poly(r,d,s)$. We answer both in the negative by showing the exponential lower bound $f_{r}(d,s,\ldots,s)&gt; s^{r}$ for any $r\ge 2$, $s\ge 1$ and $d\ge 2r-2$, which matches the upper bound up to a multiplicative $\log{s}$ factor for sufficiently large $s$. Our construction combines a scalloped planar configuration with a direct product of regular $s$-gon on the high-dimensional torus $(\mathbb{S}^1)^{r-2}$. Perhaps surprisingly, if we additionally require that within each block the $s_i$ convex sets are pairwise disjoint, the picture changes markedly. Let $F_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote this disjoint-union variant of the extremal function. We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\log s)$ by connecting it to a suitable line-separating function in the plane; (2) when $s$ is large, $F_r(d,s,\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by $O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\log r\cdot s^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the geometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a variant of the Erd\H{o}s box problem.</description>

      <title>Generalised wavefunction coefficients and acyclonesto-cosmohedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes of $\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory can be encoded as the canonical form of the Stasheff associahedron. Similarly, the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of the same theory are captured by the recently proposed cosmohedron, a non-simple polytope associated to the Stasheff associahedron; unitarity and locality of the amplitudes and wavefunction coefficients are then encoded in the factorisation properties of faces of these polytopes. In this paper, we argue that these desirable properties of the Stasheff associahedron are shared by a wider class of polytopes called acyclonestohedra and generalise the cosmohedron construction to arbitrary acyclonestohedra.
  Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally, an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby extending recent results for graph associahedra, and construct truncations of acyclonestohedra into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as sections of graph cosmohedra.</description>
