      <title>Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions, response dynamics) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.</description>

      <title>Spatial-temporal analysis of neural desynchronization in sleep-like states reveals critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep is characterized by non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep, originating from widespread neuronal synchrony, and REM sleep, with neuronal desynchronization akin to waking behavior. While these were thought to be global brain states, recent research suggests otherwise. Using time-frequency analysis of mesoscopic voltage-sensitive dye recordings of mice in a urethane-anesthetized model of sleep, we find transient neural desynchronization occurring heterogeneously across the cortex within a background of synchronized neural activity, in a manner reminiscent of a critical spreading process and indicative of an "edge-of-synchronization phase" transition.</description>

      <title>Reliable Object Tracking by Multimodal Hybrid Feature Extraction and Transformer-Based Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual object tracking, which is primarily based on visible light image sequences, encounters numerous challenges in complicated scenarios, such as low light conditions, high dynamic ranges, and background clutter. To address these challenges, incorporating the advantages of multiple visual modalities is a promising solution for achieving reliable object tracking. However, the existing approaches usually integrate multimodal inputs through adaptive local feature interactions, which cannot leverage the full potential of visual cues, thus resulting in insufficient feature modeling. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal hybrid tracker (MMHT) that utilizes frame-event-based data for reliable single object tracking. The MMHT model employs a hybrid backbone consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract dominant features from different visual modalities and then uses a unified encoder to align the features across different domains. Moreover, we propose an enhanced transformer-based module to fuse multimodal features using attention mechanisms. With these methods, the MMHT model can effectively construct a multiscale and multidimensional visual feature space and achieve discriminative feature modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MMHT model exhibits competitive performance in comparison with that of other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the MMHT model in terms of addressing the challenges faced in visual object tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>fMRI predictors based on language models of increasing complexity recover brain left lateralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, studies of naturalistic language processing where participants are scanned while listening to continuous text have flourished. Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, we show that a left-right asymmetry gradually appears as model size increases, and that the difference in left-right brain correlations also follows a scaling law. Whereas the smallest models show no asymmetry, larger models fit better and better left hemispheric activations than right hemispheric ones. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.</description>

      <title>MorphGrower: A Synchronized Layer-by-layer Growing Approach for Plausible Neuronal Morphology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal morphology is essential for studying brain functioning and understanding neurodegenerative disorders. As acquiring real-world morphology data is expensive, computational approaches for morphology generation have been studied. Traditional methods heavily rely on expert-set rules and parameter tuning, making it difficult to generalize across different types of morphologies. Recently, MorphVAE was introduced as the sole learning-based method, but its generated morphologies lack plausibility, i.e., they do not appear realistic enough and most of the generated samples are topologically invalid. To fill this gap, this paper proposes MorphGrower, which mimicks the neuron natural growth mechanism for generation. Specifically, MorphGrower generates morphologies layer by layer, with each subsequent layer conditioned on the previously generated structure. During each layer generation, MorphGrower utilizes a pair of sibling branches as the basic generation block and generates branch pairs synchronously. This approach ensures topological validity and allows for fine-grained generation, thereby enhancing the realism of the final generated morphologies. Results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MorphGrower outperforms MorphVAE by a notable margin. Importantly, the electrophysiological response simulation demonstrates the plausibility of our generated samples from a neuroscience perspective. Our code is available at https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/MorphGrower.</description>

      <title>Mind-to-Image: Projecting Visual Mental Imagination of the Brain from fMRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05468v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconstruction of images observed by subjects from fMRI data collected during visual stimuli has made strong progress in the past decade, thanks to the availability of extensive fMRI datasets and advancements in generative models for image generation. However, the application of visual reconstruction has remained limited. Reconstructing visual imagination presents a greater challenge, with potentially revolutionary applications ranging from aiding individuals with disabilities to verifying witness accounts in court. The primary hurdles in this field are the absence of data collection protocols for visual imagery and the lack of datasets on the subject. Traditionally, fMRI-to-image relies on data collected from subjects exposed to visual stimuli, which poses issues for generating visual imagery based on the difference of brain activity between visual stimulation and visual imagery. For the first time, we have compiled a substantial dataset (around 6h of scans) on visual imagery along with a proposed data collection protocol. We then train a modified version of an fMRI-to-image model and demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing images from two modes of imagination: from memory and from pure imagination. The resulting pipeline we call Mind-to-Image marks a step towards creating a technology that allow direct reconstruction of visual imagery.</description>

      <title>Adaptive behavior with stable synapses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral changes in animals and humans, as a consequence of an error or a verbal instruction, can be extremely rapid. Improvement in behavioral performances are usually associated in machine learning and reinforcement learning to synaptic plasticity, and, in general, to changes and optimization of network parameters. However, such rapid changes are not coherent with the timescales of synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for that could be a dynamical network reconfiguration. In the last few years, similar capabilities have been observed in transformers, foundational architecture in the field of machine learning that are widely used in applications such as natural language and image processing. Transformers are capable of in-context learning, the ability to adapt and acquire new information dynamically within the context of the task or environment they are currently engaged in, without the need for significant changes to their underlying parameters. Building upon the notion of something unique within transformers enabling the emergence of this property, we claim that it could also be supported by input segregation and dendritic amplification, features extensively observed in biological networks. We propose an architecture composed of gain-modulated recurrent networks that excels at in-context learning, showing abilities inaccessible to standard networks.</description>

      <title>BDHT: Generative AI Enables Causality Analysis for Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective connectivity estimation plays a crucial role in understanding the interactions and information flow between different brain regions. However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment.</description>
