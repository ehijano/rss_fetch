      <title>Beyond Utility: Evaluating LLM as Recommender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies employed LLMs as recommenders to provide personalized information services for distinct users. Despite efforts to improve the accuracy of LLM-based recommendation models, relatively little attention is paid to beyond-utility dimensions. Moreover, there are unique evaluation aspects of LLM-based recommendation models, which have been largely ignored. To bridge this gap, we explore four new evaluation dimensions and propose a multidimensional evaluation framework. The new evaluation dimensions include: 1) history length sensitivity, 2) candidate position bias, 3) generation-involved performance, and 4) hallucinations. All four dimensions have the potential to impact performance, but are largely unnecessary for consideration in traditional systems. Using this multidimensional evaluation framework, along with traditional aspects, we evaluate the performance of seven LLM-based recommenders, with three prompting strategies, comparing them with six traditional models on both ranking and re-ranking tasks on four datasets. We find that LLMs excel at handling tasks with prior knowledge and shorter input histories in the ranking setting, and perform better in the re-ranking setting, beating traditional models across multiple dimensions. However, LLMs exhibit substantial candidate position bias issues, and some models hallucinate non-existent items much more often than others. We intend our evaluation framework and observations to benefit future research on the use of LLMs as recommenders.

      <title>A Survey on Bundle Recommendation: Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, bundle recommendation systems have gained significant attention in both academia and industry due to their ability to enhance user experience and increase sales by recommending a set of items as a bundle rather than individual items. This survey provides a comprehensive review on bundle recommendation, beginning by a taxonomy for exploring product bundling. We classify it into two categories based on bundling strategy from various application domains, i.e., discriminative and generative bundle recommendation. Then we formulate the corresponding tasks of the two categories and systematically review their methods: 1) representation learning from bundle and item levels and interaction modeling for discriminative bundle recommendation; 2) representation learning from item level and bundle generation for generative bundle recommendation. Subsequently, we survey the resources of bundle recommendation including datasets and evaluation metrics, and conduct reproducibility experiments on mainstream models. Lastly, we discuss the main challenges and highlight the promising future directions in the field of bundle recommendation, aiming to serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/bundle-recommendation-survey.</description>

      <title>DivNet: Diversity-Aware Self-Correcting Sequential Recommendation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the last stage of a typical \textit{recommendation system}, \textit{collective recommendation} aims to give the final touches to the recommended items and their layout so as to optimize overall objectives such as diversity and whole-page relevance. In practice, however, the interaction dynamics among the recommended items, their visual appearances and meta-data such as specifications are often too complex to be captured by experts' heuristics or simple models. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{\underline{div}ersity-aware self-correcting sequential recommendation \underline{net}works} (\textit{DivNet}) that is able to estimate utility by capturing the complex interactions among sequential items and diversify recommendations simultaneously. Experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate that \textit{DivNet} can achieve better results compared to baselines with or without collective recommendations.</description>

      <title>LLM-KT: A Versatile Framework for Knowledge Transfer from Large Language Models to Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LLM-KT, a flexible framework designed to enhance collaborative filtering (CF) models by seamlessly integrating LLM (Large Language Model)-generated features. Unlike existing methods that rely on passing LLM-generated features as direct inputs, our framework injects these features into an intermediate layer of any CF model, allowing the model to reconstruct and leverage the embeddings internally. This model-agnostic approach works with a wide range of CF models without requiring architectural changes, making it adaptable to various recommendation scenarios. Our framework is built for easy integration and modification, providing researchers and developers with a powerful tool for extending CF model capabilities through efficient knowledge transfer. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon datasets, where it consistently improves baseline CF models. Experimental studies showed that LLM-KT is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods in context-aware settings but can be applied to a broader range of CF models than current approaches.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Metadata Mess: Alignment &amp; Risk Assessment for Diatom Data Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biologists study Diatoms, a fundamental algae, to assess the health of aquatic systems. Diatom specimens have traditionally been preserved on analog slides, where a single slide can contain thousands of these microscopic organisms. Digitization of these collections presents both metadata challenges and opportunities. This paper reports on metadata research aimed at providing access to a digital portion of the Academy of Natural Sciences' Diatom Herbarium, Drexel University. We report results of a 3-part study covering 1) a review of relevant metadata standards and a microscopy metadata framework shared by Hammer et al., 2) a baseline metadata alignment mapping current diatom metadata properties to standard metadata types, and 3) a metadata risk analysis associated with the course of standard data curation practices. This research is part of an effort involving the transfer of these digital slides to an new system, DataFed, to support global accessible. The final section of this paper includes a conclusion and discusses next steps.</description>

      <title>NeuroSym-BioCAT: Leveraging Neuro-Symbolic Methods for Biomedical Scholarly Document Categorization and Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing volume of biomedical scholarly document abstracts presents an increasing challenge in efficiently retrieving accurate and relevant information. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates an optimized topic modelling framework, OVB-LDA, with the BI-POP CMA-ES optimization technique for enhanced scholarly document abstract categorization. Complementing this, we employ the distilled MiniLM model, fine-tuned on domain-specific data, for high-precision answer extraction. Our approach is evaluated across three configurations: scholarly document abstract retrieval, gold-standard scholarly documents abstract, and gold-standard snippets, consistently outperforming established methods such as RYGH and bio-answer finder. Notably, we demonstrate that extracting answers from scholarly documents abstracts alone can yield high accuracy, underscoring the sufficiency of abstracts for many biomedical queries. Despite its compact size, MiniLM exhibits competitive performance, challenging the prevailing notion that only large, resource-intensive models can handle such complex tasks. Our results, validated across various question types and evaluation batches, highlight the robustness and adaptability of our method in real-world biomedical applications. While our approach shows promise, we identify challenges in handling complex list-type questions and inconsistencies in evaluation metrics. Future work will focus on refining the topic model with more extensive domain-specific datasets, further optimizing MiniLM and utilizing large language models (LLM) to improve both precision and efficiency in biomedical question answering.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Query Policies in Active Learning for Efficient Autonomous Robotic Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In missions constrained by finite resources, efficient data collection is critical. Informative path planning, driven by automated decision-making, optimizes exploration by reducing the costs associated with accurate characterization of a target in an environment. Previous implementations of active learning did not consider the action cost for regression problems or only considered the action cost for classification problems. This paper analyzes an AL algorithm for Gaussian Process regression while incorporating action cost. The algorithm's performance is compared on various regression problems to include terrain mapping on diverse simulated surfaces along metrics of root mean square error, samples and distance until convergence, and model variance upon convergence. The cost-dependent acquisition policy doesn't organically optimize information gain over distance. Instead, the traditional uncertainty metric with a distance constraint best minimizes root-mean-square error over trajectory distance. This studys impact is to provide insight into incorporating action cost with AL methods to optimize exploration under realistic mission constraints.</description>

      <title>PSL: Rethinking and Improving Softmax Loss from Pairwise Perspective for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softmax Loss (SL) is widely applied in recommender systems (RS) and has demonstrated effectiveness. This work analyzes SL from a pairwise perspective, revealing two significant limitations: 1) the relationship between SL and conventional ranking metrics like DCG is not sufficiently tight; 2) SL is highly sensitive to false negative instances. Our analysis indicates that these limitations are primarily due to the use of the exponential function. To address these issues, this work extends SL to a new family of loss functions, termed Pairwise Softmax Loss (PSL), which replaces the exponential function in SL with other appropriate activation functions. While the revision is minimal, we highlight three merits of PSL: 1) it serves as a tighter surrogate for DCG with suitable activation functions; 2) it better balances data contributions; and 3) it acts as a specific BPR loss enhanced by Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We further validate the effectiveness and robustness of PSL through empirical experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/IR-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Building Multi-Agent Copilot towards Autonomous Agricultural Data Management and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current agricultural data management and analysis paradigms are to large extent traditional, in which data collecting, curating, integration, loading, storing, sharing and analyzing still involve too much human effort and know-how. The experts, researchers and the farm operators need to understand the data and the whole process of data management pipeline to make fully use of the data. The essential problem of the traditional paradigm is the lack of a layer of orchestrational intelligence which can understand, organize and coordinate the data processing utilities to maximize data management and analysis outcome. The emerging reasoning and tool mastering abilities of large language models (LLM) make it a potentially good fit to this position, which helps a shift from the traditional user-driven paradigm to AI-driven paradigm. In this paper, we propose and explore the idea of a LLM based copilot for autonomous agricultural data management and analysis. Based on our previously developed platform of Agricultural Data Management and Analytics (ADMA), we build a proof-of-concept multi-agent system called ADMA Copilot, which can understand user's intent, makes plans for data processing pipeline and accomplishes tasks automatically, in which three agents: a LLM based controller, an input formatter and an output formatter collaborate together. Different from existing LLM based solutions, by defining a meta-program graph, our work decouples control flow and data flow to enhance the predictability of the behaviour of the agents. Experiments demonstrates the intelligence, autonomy, efficacy, efficiency, extensibility, flexibility and privacy of our system. Comparison is also made between ours and existing systems to show the superiority and potential of our system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.</description>

      <title>Improving Musical Instrument Classification with Advanced Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musical instrument classification, a key area in Music Information Retrieval, has gained considerable interest due to its applications in education, digital music production, and consumer media. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically deep learning, have enhanced the capability to identify and classify musical instruments from audio signals. This study applies various machine learning methods, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Boosting techniques like AdaBoost and XGBoost, as well as deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Artificial Neural Networks. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated on the NSynth dataset, a large repository of annotated musical sounds. By comparing these approaches, the analysis aims to showcase the advantages and limitations of each method, providing guidance for developing more accurate and efficient classification systems. Additionally, hybrid model testing and discussion are included. This research aims to support further studies in instrument classification by proposing new approaches and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Improving Few-Shot Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition by Instruction Tuning a Word-Embedding based Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER is the process of leveraging knowledge from data-rich source domains to perform entity recognition on data scarce target domains. Most previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches use pre-trained language models (PLMs) for cross-domain NER. However, these models are often domain specific. To successfully use these models for new target domains, we need to modify either the model architecture or perform model finetuning using data from the new domains. Both of these result in the creation of entirely new NER models for each target domain which is infeasible for practical scenarios. Recently,several works have attempted to use LLMs to solve Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER. However, most of these are either too expensive for practical purposes or struggle to follow LLM prompt instructions. In this paper, we propose IF-WRANER (Instruction Finetuned Word-embedding based Retrieval Augmented large language model for Named Entity Recognition), a retrieval augmented LLM, finetuned for the NER task. By virtue of the regularization techniques used during LLM finetuning and the adoption of word-level embedding over sentence-level embedding during the retrieval of in-prompt examples, IF-WRANER is able to outperform previous SOTA Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER approaches. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by benchmarking its performance on the open source CrossNER dataset, on which it shows more than 2% F1 score improvement over the previous SOTA model. We have deployed the model for multiple customer care domains of an enterprise. Accurate entity prediction through IF-WRANER helps direct customers to automated workflows for the domains, thereby reducing escalations to human agents by almost 15% and leading to millions of dollars in yearly savings for the company.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an extendable modular system that compiles a range of music feature extraction models to aid music information retrieval research. The features include musical elements like key, downbeats, and genre, as well as audio characteristics like instrument recognition, vocals/instrumental classification, and vocals gender detection. The integrated models are state-of-the-art or latest open-source. The features can be extracted as latent or post-processed labels, enabling integration into music applications such as generative music, recommendation, and playlist generation. The modular design allows easy integration of newly developed systems, making it a good benchmarking and comparison tool. This versatile toolkit supports the research community in developing innovative solutions by providing concrete musical features.</description>

      <title>A graph-based approach to extracting narrative signals from public discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. As the significance of narratives for understanding current societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived political speeches, social media posts, political manifestos and transcripts of parliamentary debates. We conceptualize these political narratives as a type of ontological narratives: stories by which actors position themselves as political beings, and which are akin to political worldviews in which actors present their normative vision of the world, or aspects thereof. We approach the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval: starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these graphs for representations of 1) actors, 2) the events in which these actors figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core narrative signals that initiate a further analysis by alluding to larger political narratives. By means of a case study of State of the European Union addresses, we demonstrate how the formalism can be used to inductively surface signals of political narratives from public discourse.</description>

      <title>CORAG: A Cost-Constrained Retrieval Optimization System for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities but often struggle to access up-to-date information, which can lead to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating knowledge from external databases, enabling more accurate and relevant responses. Due to the context window constraints of LLMs, it is impractical to input the entire external database context directly into the model. Instead, only the most relevant information, referred to as chunks, is selectively retrieved. However, current RAG research faces three key challenges. First, existing solutions often select each chunk independently, overlooking potential correlations among them. Second, in practice the utility of chunks is non-monotonic, meaning that adding more chunks can decrease overall utility. Traditional methods emphasize maximizing the number of included chunks, which can inadvertently compromise performance. Third, each type of user query possesses unique characteristics that require tailored handling, an aspect that current approaches do not fully consider. To overcome these challenges, we propose a cost constrained retrieval optimization system CORAG for retrieval-augmented generation. We employ a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based policy framework to find optimal chunk combinations sequentially, allowing for a comprehensive consideration of correlations among chunks. Additionally, rather than viewing budget exhaustion as a termination condition, we integrate budget constraints into the optimization of chunk combinations, effectively addressing the non-monotonicity of chunk utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents have gained considerable attention for their decision-making skills and ability to handle complex tasks. Recognizing the current gap in leveraging agent capabilities for multi-agent collaboration in recommendation systems, we introduce MACRec, a novel framework designed to enhance recommendation systems through multi-agent collaboration. Unlike existing work on using agents for user/item simulation, we aim to deploy multi-agents to tackle recommendation tasks directly. In our framework, recommendation tasks are addressed through the collaborative efforts of various specialized agents, including Manager, User/Item Analyst, Reflector, Searcher, and Task Interpreter, with different working flows. Furthermore, we provide application examples of how developers can easily use MACRec on various recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, conversational recommendation, and explanation generation of recommendation results. The framework and demonstration video are publicly available at https://github.com/wzf2000/MACRec.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-Aspect Queries for Conversational Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational information seeking (CIS) systems aim to model the user's information need within the conversational context and retrieve the relevant information. One major approach to modeling the conversational context aims to rewrite the user utterance in the conversation to represent the information need independently. Recent work has shown the benefit of expanding the rewritten utterance with relevant terms. In this work, we hypothesize that breaking down the information of an utterance into multi-aspect rewritten queries can lead to more effective retrieval performance. This is more evident in more complex utterances that require gathering evidence from various information sources, where a single query rewrite or query representation cannot capture the complexity of the utterance. To test this hypothesis, we conduct extensive experiments on five widely used CIS datasets where we leverage LLMs to generate multi-aspect queries to represent the information need for each utterance in multiple query rewrites. We show that, for most of the utterances, the same retrieval model would perform better with more than one rewritten query by 85% in terms of nDCG@3. We further propose a multi-aspect query generation and retrieval framework, called MQ4CS. Our extensive experiments show that MQ4CS outperforms the state-of-the-art query rewriting methods. We make our code and our new dataset of generated multi-aspect queries publicly available.</description>

      <title>LLM-ESR: Large Language Models Enhancement for Long-tailed Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems (SRS) aim to predict users' subsequent choices based on their historical interactions and have found applications in diverse fields such as e-commerce and social media. However, in real-world systems, most users interact with only a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These two issues, known as the long-tail user and long-tail item challenges, often pose difficulties for existing SRS. These challenges can adversely affect user experience and seller benefits, making them crucial to address. Though a few works have addressed the challenges, they still struggle with the seesaw or noisy issues due to the intrinsic scarcity of interactions. The advancements in large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these problems from a semantic perspective. As one of the pioneers in this field, we propose the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR). This framework utilizes semantic embeddings derived from LLMs to enhance SRS without adding extra inference load from LLMs. To address the long-tail item challenge, we design a dual-view modeling framework that combines semantics from LLMs and collaborative signals from conventional SRS. For the long-tail user challenge, we propose a retrieval augmented self-distillation method to enhance user preference representation using more informative interactions from similar users. To verify the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed enhancement framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets using three popular SRS models. The results show that our method surpasses existing baselines consistently, and benefits long-tail users and items especially. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/LLM-ESR.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{MixGR}$: Enhancing Retriever Generalization for Scientific Domain through Complementary Granularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show the growing significance of document retrieval in the generation of LLMs, i.e., RAG, within the scientific domain by bridging their knowledge gap. However, dense retrievers often struggle with domain-specific retrieval and complex query-document relationships, particularly when query segments correspond to various parts of a document. To alleviate such prevalent challenges, this paper introduces $\texttt{MixGR}$, which improves dense retrievers' awareness of query-document matching across various levels of granularity in queries and documents using a zero-shot approach. $\texttt{MixGR}$ fuses various metrics based on these granularities to a united score that reflects a comprehensive query-document similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{MixGR}$ outperforms previous document retrieval by 24.7%, 9.8%, and 6.9% on nDCG@5 with unsupervised, supervised, and LLM-based retrievers, respectively, averaged on queries containing multiple subqueries from five scientific retrieval datasets. Moreover, the efficacy of two downstream scientific question-answering tasks highlights the advantage of $\texttt{MixGR}$ to boost the application of LLMs in the scientific domain. The code and experimental datasets are available.</description>

      <title>User-Creator Feature Polarization in Recommender Systems with Dual Influence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems serve the dual purpose of presenting relevant content to users and helping content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems naturally influences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the items they are recommended, while creators may be incentivized to alter their content to attract more users. We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influence of recommender systems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both theoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and promoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ truncation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict the next interaction item based on users' past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches are eager to apply LLMs to sequential recommendation. A common paradigm is converting user behavior sequences into instruction data, and fine-tuning the LLM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA). However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors is insufficient to capture individual variability, resulting in negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA). We innovatively treat the sequential recommendation task as a form of multi-task learning, integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. This approach encourages different experts to capture various aspects of user behavior. Additionally, we introduce a sequence representation guided gate function that generates customized expert participation weights for each user sequence, which allows dynamic parameter adjustment for instance-wise recommendations. In sequential recommendation, iLoRA achieves an average relative improvement of 11.4\% over basic LoRA in the hit ratio metric, with less than a 1\% relative increase in trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in mitigating negative transfer and improving recommendation accuracy. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/AkaliKong/iLoRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial decision-making hinges on the analysis of relevant information embedded in the enormous volume of documents in the financial domain. To address this challenge, we developed FinQAPT, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the identification of relevant financial reports based on a query, extracts pertinent context, and leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform downstream tasks. To evaluate the pipeline, we experimented with various techniques to optimize the performance of each module using the FinQA dataset. We introduced a novel clustering-based negative sampling technique to enhance context extraction and a novel prompting method called Dynamic N-shot Prompting to boost the numerical question-answering capabilities of LLMs. At the module level, we achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on FinQA, attaining an accuracy of 80.6%. However, at the pipeline level, we observed decreased performance due to challenges in extracting relevant context from financial reports. We conducted a detailed error analysis of each module and the end-to-end pipeline, pinpointing specific challenges that must be addressed to develop a robust solution for handling complex financial tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Proportional Representation in Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image search and retrieval tasks can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, erase cultural identities, and amplify social disparities. Current approaches to mitigate these representational harms balance the number of retrieved items across population groups defined by a small number of (often binary) attributes. However, most existing methods overlook intersectional groups determined by combinations of group attributes, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We develop practical methods for estimating MPR, provide theoretical guarantees, and propose optimization algorithms to ensure MPR in retrieval. We demonstrate that existing methods optimizing for equal and proportional representation metrics may fail to promote MPR. Crucially, our work shows that optimizing MPR yields more proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups specified by a rich function class, often with minimal compromise in retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) trained on web-scale datasets are largely successful due to their ability to memorize large amounts of training data, even if only present in a few examples. These capabilities are often desirable in evaluation on tasks such as question answering but raise questions about whether these models can exhibit genuine reasoning or succeed only at mimicking patterns from the training data. This distinction is particularly salient in forecasting tasks, where the answer is not present in the training data, and the model must reason to make logical deductions. We present Reasoning and Tools for Forecasting (RTF), a framework of reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically retrieve updated information and run numerical simulation with equipped tools. We evaluate our model with questions from competitive forecasting platforms and demonstrate that our method is competitive with and can outperform human predictions. This suggests that LMs, with the right tools, can indeed think and adapt like humans, offering valuable insights for real-world decision-making.</description>

      <title>Unveiling User Satisfaction and Creator Productivity Trade-Offs in Recommendation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated user traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the platform's sustainability. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. In contrast, a more aggressive exploration policy may slightly compromise user satisfaction but promote higher content creation volume. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate user satisfaction and overall content production on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model can serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for recommendation algorithms on UGC platforms, helping to align their immediate objectives with sustainable, long-term goals.</description>
