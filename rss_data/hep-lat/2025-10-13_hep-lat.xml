      <title>Emergence of the $\pi(1300)$ Resonance from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of the lightest hadron in nature, the pion, is one seventh of that of the nucleon, and one tenth of the mass of its first excited state, the $\pi(1300)$. This enormous energy difference opens an interesting window into the confinement of quarks and the structure of the lightest hadrons. In this work, we provide the first calculation of resonance parameters of the $\pi(1300)$ from lattice QCD. For this purpose, recently derived state-of-the-art tools are adapted and applied both in the construction of three-hadron operators and for mapping finite-volume spectra to infinite-volume amplitudes, subsequently analytically continuing these to complex energies. For our heavy pion mass ensembles, we find a clear signal of the resonance. Crucial input is provided through Chiral Perturbation Theory, allowing us to robustly extrapolate to the physical point. Applying model averaging, we extract a pole position of $M_{\pi(1300)}=(1169\pm46)-i\,(62_{-62}^{+168})\,\rm MeV$ supporting values from phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Two-loop anomalous dimensions for baryon-number-violating operators in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalization-group equations for the baryon-number-violating dimension-six operators in the SMEFT. This includes all three gauge interactions, the Yukawa, and Higgs self-interaction contributions. In addition, we present the one-loop matching of the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark on the SMEFT, which can generate the Wilson coefficients of all four gauge-invariant baryon-number-violating SMEFT operators. Using this example, we demonstrate the cancellation of scheme and matching-scale dependences. Together with the known two-loop renormalization-group evolution below the electroweak scale in the LEFT, as well as the one-loop matching of SMEFT onto LEFT, our results enable consistent next-to-leading-log analyses of nucleon decays, provided that the relevant matrix elements are known at next-to-leading-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>The charge-singlet measurement toolbox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to physical laws across different scales$\unicode{x2014}$from spacetime structure in general relativity to particle interactions in quantum field theory. Local symmetries, described by gauge theories, are central to phenomena such as superconductivity, topological phases, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Emerging simulation techniques using tensor network states or quantum computers offer exciting new possibilities of exploring the physics of these gauge theories, but require careful implementation of gauge symmetry and charge-neutrality constraints. This is especially challenging for non-Abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In a recent article (arXiv:2501.00579), we introduced "charge-singlet measurements" for quantum simulations, consisting of a projection based technique from group representation theory that allowed us to probe for the first time the phase diagram of (1+1)-dimensional QCD on a quantum computer. In this article, we show more broadly how to apply charge-singlet measurements as a flexible tool for both classical and quantum simulations of discrete and continuous gauge theories. Our approach extends the use of charge-singlet measurements beyond state preparation in the charge neutral (charge-singlet) sector to include noise mitigation in symmetry-preserving time-evolution circuits. We further demonstrate how this method enables the computation of thermodynamic observables$\unicode{x2014}$such as entropy$\unicode{x2014}$within the charge-singlet subspace, providing a new tool for exploring the connection between quantum thermodynamics and gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulations of Sphaleron Dynamics at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphaleron dynamics in the Standard Model at high-energy particle collisions remains experimentally unobserved, with theoretical predictions hindered by its nonperturbative real-time nature. In this work, we investigate a quantum simulation approach to this challenge. Taking the $1+1$D $O(3)$ model as a protocol towards studying dynamics of sphaleron in the electroweak theory, we identify the sphaleron configuration and establish lattice parameters that reproduce continuum sphaleron energies with controlled precision. We then develop quantum algorithms to simulate sphaleron evolutions where quantum effects can be included. This work lays the ground to establish quantum simulations for studying the interaction between classical topological objects and particles in the quantum field theory that are usually inaccessible to classical methods and computations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</description>
