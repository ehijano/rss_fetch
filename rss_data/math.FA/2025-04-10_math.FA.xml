      <title>Some Remarks on the Product Formula for Defect Numbers of Closed Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This largely pedagogical paper recalls some facts on defect numbers of products of closed operators employing results from the theory of semi-Fredholm operators and then applies these facts to positive integer powers of symmetric operators and subsequently to certain minimal Sturm--Liouville and minimal higher even-order ordinary and partial differential operators. We also point out some unexpected missed opportunities when comparing the work of different groups on this subject.</description>

      <title>A Convex-Analytical Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weak version of Birkhoff's generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem states that every endomorphism of a finite-dimensional real vector that leaves invariant a non-degenerate closed convex cone has an eigenvector in that cone.
  Here, we show that this theorem, whose proof relies only upon basic convex analysis, yields very short proofs of both the spectral theorem for selfadjoint operators of Euclidean spaces and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</description>

      <title>Almost everywhere convergence of the convolution type Laguerre expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed d-tuple $\alpha=(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_d)\in(-1,\infty)^d$, consider the product space $\mathbb{R}_+^d:=(0,\infty)^d$ equipped with Euclidean distance $\arrowvert \cdot \arrowvert$ and the measure $d\mu_{\alpha}(x)=x_1^{2\alpha_1+1}\cdot\cdot\cdot x_{d}^{\alpha_d}dx_1\cdot\cdot\cdot dx_d$. We consider the Laguerre operator $L_{\alpha}=-\Delta+\sum_{i=1}^{d}\frac{2\alpha_j+1}{x_j}\frac{d}{dx_j}+\arrowvert x\arrowvert^2$ which is a compact, positive, self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+^d,d\mu_{\alpha}(x))$. In this paper, we study almost everywhere convergence of the Bochner-Riesz means associated with $L_\alpha$ which is defined by $S_R^{\lambda}(L_\alpha)f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(1-\frac{e_n}{R^2})_{+}^{\lambda}P_nf(x)$. Here $e_n$ is n-th eigenvalue of $L_{\alpha}$, and $P_nf(x)$ is the n-th Laguerre spectral projection operator. This corresponds to the convolution-type Laguerre expansions introduced in Thangavelu's lecture \cite{TS3}. For $2\leq p&lt;\infty$, we prove that $$\lim_{R\rightarrow\infty} S_R^{\lambda}(L_\alpha)f=f\,\,\,\,-a.e.$$ for all $f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}_+^d,d\mu_{\alpha}(x))$, provided that $\lambda&gt;\lambda(\alpha,p)/2$, where $\lambda(\alpha,p)=\max\{2(\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_1+d)(1/2-1/p)-1/2,0\}$, and $\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_1:=\sum_{j=1}^{d}\alpha_{j}$. Conversely, if $2\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_{1}+2d&gt;1$, we will show the convergence generally fails if $\lambda&lt;\lambda(\alpha,p)/2$ in the sense that there is an $f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}_+^d,d\mu_{\alpha}(x))$ for $(4\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_{1}+4d)/(2\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_{1}+2d-1)&lt; p$ such that the convergence fails. When $2\arrowvert\alpha\arrowvert_{1}+2d\leq1$, our results show that a.e. convergence holds for $f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}_+^d,d\mu_{\alpha}(x))$ with $p\geq 2$ whenever $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A new norm on the space of reproducing kernel Hilbert space operators and Berezin number inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a novel norm, termed the $t-$Berezin norm, on the algebra of all bounded linear operators defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ as
  $$\|A\|_{t-ber} = \sup_{ \lambda, \mu \in \Omega} \left\{ t|\langle A \hat{k}_\lambda, \hat{k}_\mu \rangle| + (1-t) |\langle A^* \hat{k}_\lambda, \hat{k}_\mu \rangle| \right\}, \quad t\in [0,1],$$
  where $A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a bounded linear operator. This norm characterizes those invertible operators which are also unitary.
  Using this newly defined norm, we establish various upper bounds for the Berezin number, thereby refining the existing results. Additionally, we derive several sharp bounds for the Berezin number of an operator via the Orlicz function.</description>

      <title>The affine group of a local field is Hermitian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether the group $\mathbb{Q}_p \rtimes \mathbb{Q}_p^*$ is Hermitian has been stated as an open question in multiple sources in the literature, even as recently as a paper by R. Palma published in 2015. In this note we confirm that this group is Hermitian by proving the following more general theorem: given any local field $\mathbb{K}$, the affine group $\mathbb{K} \rtimes \mathbb{K}^*$ is a Hermitian group. The proof is a simple consequence of results about Hermitian Banach $*$-algebras from the 1970's. In the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is a non-archimedean local field, this result produces examples of totally disconnected locally compact Hermitian groups with exponential growth, and as far as the author is aware, these are the first examples of groups satisfying these properties. This answers a second question of Palma about the existence of such groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a modification of a generalized Takagi-van der Waerden function on a metric space we prove that for any closed subset of a metric space without isolated points there exists a continuous function such that its big and local Lipschitz derivatives are equal to infinity exactly on this set. Moreover, if given space is hermetic (for example, if it is normed) then the little Lipschitz derivative has the same property.</description>

      <title>Framelets and Wavelets with Mixed Dilation Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a main research area in applied and computational harmonic analysis, the theory and applications of framelets have been extensively investigated. Most existing literature is devoted to framelet systems that only use one dilation matrix as the sampling factor. To keep some key properties such as directionality, a framelet system often has a high redundancy rate. To reduce redundancy, a one-dimensional tight framelet with mixed dilation factors has been introduced for image processing. Though such tight framelets offer good performance in practice, their theoretical properties are far from being well understood. In this paper, we will systematically investigate framelets with mixed dilation factors, with arbitrary multiplicity in arbitrary dimensions. We will first study the discrete framelet transform employing a filter bank with mixed dilation factors and discuss its various properties. Next, we will introduce the notion of a discrete affine system in $l_2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ and study discrete framelet transforms with mixed dilation factors. Finally, we will discuss framelets and wavelets with mixed dilation factors in the space $L_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linear heat equation on a bounded domain and on an exterior domain. We study estimates of any order derivatives of the solution locally in time in the Lebesgue spaces. We give a proof of the estimates in the end-point cases $p = 1, \infty$. We also obtain derivative estimates for the equation with the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On a weighted version of the BBM formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a weighted version of the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) formula, both in the pointwise and $\Gamma$-convergence sense, together with a compactness criterion for energy-bounded sequences. The non-negative weights need only be $L^\infty$ convergent to a bounded and uniformly continuous limit. We apply the BBM formula to show a Poincar\'e-type inequality and the stability of the first eigenvalues relative to the energies. Finally, we discuss a non-local analogue of the weighted BBM formula.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theorem and explicit interpolation formula for non-decaying unbounded signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03667v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes an analog Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov sampling theorem for unbounded non-decaying band-limited signals. An explicit interpolation formula is obtained for signals sublinear growth with rate of growth less than 1/2. At any time, the rate of decay for the $k$th coefficients of this formula is $\sim 1/k^2$. In addition, the paper obtains a method for calculating the coefficients of the interpolation formula applicable to signals with arbitrarily high rate of polynomial growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct canonical $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms without any assumptions of self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$-versions of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy the chain and Leibniz rules, and that such a "good" energy measures are unique. As an application, we also prove the $p$-energy version of Mosco's domination principle.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present an alternative proof of a quantified Tauberian theorem for vector-valued sequences first proved in \cite{Sei15_Tauberian}. The theorem relates the decay rate of a bounded sequence with properties of a certain boundary function. We present a slightly strengthened version of this result, and illustrate how it can be used to obtain quantified versions of the Katznelson--Tzafriri theorem as well as results on Ritt operators.</description>

      <title>Range strongly exposing operators between Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of bounded linear operators, called range strongly exposing (RSE) operators, which form a natural intermediate class: weaker than Bourgain's absolutely strongly exposing operators, yet stronger than both uniquely quasi norm-attaining and classical norm-attaining operators. Several foundational results on norm-attaining operators are extended to the RSE setting. Among our main contributions, we establish that for every infinite-dimensional Banach space $Y$, there exists a Banach space $X$ such that the RSE operators from $X$ to $Y$ are not dense - an RSE analogue of a result by Acosta (1999) which applies only when $Y$ is strictly convex. We also show that the Radon-Nikod\'ym property of $Y$ is sufficient to obtain that RSE operators from $L_1(\mu)$ to $Y$ are dense and that this is also necessary if $\mu$ is not purely atomic. This extends and sharpens classical results by Uhl (1976). As a consequence, we prove that the set of RSE operators between $L_1(\mu)$ and $L_1 (\nu)$ is dense if and only if at least one of the measures $\mu$ or $\nu$ is purely atomic, in contrast with the classical result by Iwanik (1979) which guarantees the denseness of norm-attaining operators for all measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. We also prove that weakly compact operators from any $C(K)$ space can always be approximated by (weakly compact) RSE operators, thereby strengthening a result of Schachermayer (1983). Additionally, we present several improvements of more recent results concerning finite-rank operators and $\Gamma$-flat operators which give, in particular, RSE versions of classical results on compact operators by Johnson-Wolfe (1979). Finally, we discuss RSE counterparts of results by Zizler and Lindenstrauss on the denseness of operators whose adjoints attain their norm.</description>

      <title>Abstract Fractional Cauchy Problem: Existence of Propagators and Inhomogeneous Solution Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous differential equation given in terms of an unbounded linear operator $A$ and the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ in time. The previously known representation of the mild solution to such a problem does not have a conventional variation-of-constants like form, with the propagator derived from the associated homogeneous problem. Instead, it relies on the existence of two propagators with different analytical properties. This fact limits theoretical and especially numerical applicability of the existing solution representation. Here, we propose an alternative representation of the mild solution to the given problem, that consolidates the solution formulas for sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with a positive sectorial operator $A$ and non-zero initial data. The new representation is solely based on the propagator of the homogeneous problem and, therefore, can be considered as a more natural fractional extension of the solution to the classical parabolic Cauchy problem. By exploiting a trade-off between the regularity assumptions on the initial data in terms of the fractional powers of $A$ and the regularity assumptions on the right-hand side in time, we show that the proposed solution formula is strongly convergent for $t \geq 0$ under considerably weaker assumptions compared to the standard results from the literature. Crucially, the achieved relaxation of space regularity assumptions ensures that the new solution representation is practically feasible for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ and is amenable to the numerical evaluation using uniformly accurate quadrature-based algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We prove $q$-super-Poincar\'e inequalities, $q \in [1, 2]$, for a class of exponential power type probability measures defined in terms of a norm in a number of subelliptic settings, primarily on stratified Lie groups but also in the Grushin and Heisenberg-Greiner settings. Our results include generically optimal isoperimetric inequalities for such probability measures.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>
