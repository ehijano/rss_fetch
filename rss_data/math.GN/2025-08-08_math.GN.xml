      <title>Sober topologies on a set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collection of all topologies on a set X forms a complete lattice with respect to the inclusion order, which have been investigated by many researchers. Sobriety is one of the core and extensively studied properties in non-Hausdorff topology. This property plays a crucial role in characterizing the spectral spaces of commutative rings and topological spaces determined by their lattices of open sets. In this paper, we investigate the statute of sober topologies in the complete lattice of all topologies on a given set. The main results to be proved include: (1) every T1 topology is the join of some sober topologies; (2) every topology is the meet of some sober topologies; (3) the set of all sober topologies is directed complete; (4) every Alexanderoff - discrete topology is the meet of some sober Alexanderoff - discrete topologies; (5) the minimal sober topologies are exactly the Scott topologies of sup-complete chains; (6) an example will be constructed to show that the intersection of a decreasing sequence of Hausdorff topologies need not be sober.</description>

      <title>On Fixed Point Theorems in Bipolar Metric Spaces Involving Polynomial-Type Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for self-mappings defined on bipolar metric spaces using a new class of contractive conditions, namely polynomial-type contractions. Our main results establish sufficient conditions under which a mapping on a complete bipolar metric space admits a UFP. Several illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of our theorems, and we further show how our results generalize and improve upon existing fixed point theorems in both standard and generalized metric settings.</description>

      <title>Operator lift of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to Khovanov-Rozansky TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a powerful tool to describe homologies, which normally involve complexes and a variety of maps/morphisms, what makes a functional integration approach with a sum over a single kind of maps seemingly problematic. In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles.</description>

      <title>On uniformly continuous surjections between function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider uniformly continuous surjections between $C_p(X)$ and $C_p(Y)$ (resp, $C_p^*(X)$ and $C_p^*(Y$)) and show that if $X$ has some dimensional-like properties, then so does $Y$. In particular, we prove that if $T:C_p(X)\to C_p(Y)$ is a continuous linear surjection, then $\dim Y=0$ if $\dim X=0$. This provides a positive answer to a question raised by Kawamura-Leiderman \cite[Problem 3.1]{kl}.</description>

      <title>Two Selection Theorems for Extremally Disconnected Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper contains a very simple proof of the classical Hasumi's theorem that each usco mapping defined on an extremally disconnected space has a continuous selection. The paper also contains a very simple proof of a recent result about extension of densely defined continuous selections for compact-valued continuous mappings, in fact a generalisation of this result to all usco mappings with a regular range.</description>
