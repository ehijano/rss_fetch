      <title>Exploring the interplay of helicity and global-frame spin density matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant $\phi$-meson global spin alignment ($\rho_{00}$) signal was measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\le62$ GeV. Conventional physics mechanisms such as $s(\bar{s})$ spin polarization fail to accommodate this $\rho_{00}$ signal, motivating further investigation into its origin. Recent studies from a general framework utilizing the gauge/gravity duality predict that there could be non-zero helicity-frame spin alignment generated by the relative motion of $s\bar{s}$ pairs to the thermal background in heavy-ion collisions, leading to significant global $\rho_{00}$. In this work, we derive the expected relationships between $\phi$-meson helicity and global-frame spin density matrix elements and confirm these analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects on these relationships from finite elliptic flow and various kinematic selections are also examined. Additionally, we extract $\rho_{00}$ simultaneously with the off-diagonal elements from the 2-dimensional $\theta^{*}$ and $\beta$ angular dimensions, as opposed to the standard 1-dimensional extraction of $\rho_{00}$. These angles describe the direction of a daughter kaon's momentum in the $\phi$-meson's rest frame, where $\theta^{*}$ is the polar angle with respect to the chosen spin-quantization axis, and $\beta$ is the azimuthal angle in the perpendicular plane. This 2-dimensional method allows us to consider possible effects from finite geometric acceptance and detector efficiencies, which could couple to the spin density matrix elements and influence the extraction of these elements within the same frame. The studies presented in this work explore the relationships between helicity and global-frame spin density matrix elements and possible detector effects on the 2-dimensional extraction of spin density matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Properties of kaon-condensed phase in hyperon-mixed matter with three-baryon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coexistent phase of kaon condensates and hyperons [($Y$+$K$) phase] in beta equilibrium with electrons and muons is investigated as a possible form of dense hadronic phase with multi-strangeness. The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of QCD Jets on the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3+1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>$^{11}$B states above the $\alpha$-decay threshold studied via $^{10}$B$(d,p){}^{11}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonance region of $^{11}$B covering excitation energies from 8.4 MeV to 13.6 MeV was investigated with the $(d,p)$ reaction performed on an enriched $^{10}$B target at the Florida State University Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph of the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory. Complementary measurements were performed with a target enriched in $^{11}$B to identify possible $^{12}$B contaminants in the $(d,p)$ reaction. Four strongly populated $^{11}$B states were observed above the $\alpha$-decay threshold. Angular distributions were measured and compared to DWBA calculations to extract angular momentum transfers and $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ spectroscopic factors. The recently observed and heavily discussed resonance at 11.4 MeV in $^{11}$B was not observed in this work. This result is consistent with the interpretation that it is predominantly a $^{10}\mathrm{Be}\left(0^+\right)+p$ resonance with a possible additional $^{7}\mathrm{Li}+\alpha$ contribution. The predicted $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ resonance at 11.6 MeV, analogous to the 11.4-MeV proton resonance, was not observed either. Upper limits for the $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ spectroscopic factors of the 11.4-MeV and 11.6-MeV states were determined. In addition, supporting configuration interaction shell model calculations with the effective WBP interaction are presented.</description>

      <title>Proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br to $^{72,74}$Se at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new experimental data for excited states of $^{72,74}$Se obtained from proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br secondary beams on a proton target. The experiments were performed with the Ursinus-NSCL Liquid Hydrogen Target and the combined GRETINA+S800 setup at the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Within uncertainties, the inclusive cross sections for proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br on a proton target are identical suggesting that the same single-particle orbitals contribute to the proton-removal reaction. In addition, details of the partial cross section fragmentation are discussed. The data might suggest that $l = 1, 2, 3$, and 4 angular momentum transfers are important to understand the population of excited states of $^{72,74}$Se in proton removal. Available data for excited states of $^{74}$Ge populated through the $^{75}$As$(d,{}^{3}{\mathrm{He}}){}^{74}$Ge proton-removal reaction in normal kinematics suggest indeed that the $fp$ and $sd$ shell as well as the $1g_{9/2}$ orbital contribute. A comparison to data available for odd-$A$ nuclei supports that the bulk of the spectroscopic strengths could be found at lower energies in the even-even Se isotopes than in, for instance, the even-even Ge isotopes. In addition, the population of high-$J$ states seems to indicate that multi-step processes contribute to proton-removal reactions at intermediate energies in these collective nuclei.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Diffusion of D Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have attempted to calculate and estimate the diffusion coefficients of D meson through rotating hadron resonance gas, which can be produced in the late stage of peripheral heavy ion collisions. According to the kinetic theory framework of relaxation time approximation and Einstein's diffusion relation, one can express D meson diffusion as a ratio of its conductivity to its susceptibility. Here, we have tuned D meson relaxation time from the knowledge of earlier works on its spatial diffusion estimations, and then we have extended the framework for the finite rotation picture of hadronic matter, where only the effect of Coriolis force is considered. The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density shows a valley-shaped pattern well-known in the community of heavy-ion physics. Diffusion coefficients of D meson show a similar structure. Our study also revealed the anisotropic nature of diffusion in the presence of rotation with future possibilities of phenomenological signature.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We present the real and imaginary parts of the photon polarization tensor as functions of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of nucleon-nucleon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing high-precision models of the nuclear force and propagating the associated uncertainties in quantum many-body calculations of nuclei and nuclear matter remain key challenges for ab initio nuclear theory. In the present work we demonstrate that generative machine learning models can construct novel instances of the nucleon-nucleon interaction when trained on existing potentials from the literature. In particular, we train the generative model on nucleon-nucleon potentials derived at second and third order in chiral effective field theory and at three different choices of the resolution scale. We then show that the model can be used to generate samples of the nucleon-nucleon potential drawn from a continuous distribution in the resolution scale parameter space. The generated potentials are shown to produce high-quality nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts. This work provides an important step toward a comprehensive estimation of theoretical uncertainties in nuclear many-body calculations that arise from the arbitrary choice of nuclear interaction and resolution scale.

      <title>Neutron skin impurity from Coulomb core polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$: Insights from PREX-II and validation via the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$ isobaric analog state reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the effect of Coulomb core-polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$, highlighting its impact on uncertainties in neutron distribution measurements due to the discrepancy between neutron excess and neutron skin regions at the surface. This effect is validated using the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$ isobaric analog state (IAS) reaction at 420 MeV. My findings reveal that the Coulomb boundary radius, where core-polarization becomes negligible, is critical for accurately probing the neutron skin region in the target nucleus. Consequently, I propose extending the $^{208}\text{Pb}(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction experiment conducted by Zegers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 202501 (2007)] to measure cross sections up to 3$^\circ$ angles to more precisely determine the neutron skin thickness in $^{208}\text{Pb}$ from theoretical reaction analysis. Additionally, I observe that, under the assumption of a large neutron skin in $^{208}\text{Pb}$, as suggested by the PREX-II result, the core-polarization effect introduces impurity into the neutron skin region.</description>

      <title>Multiboson Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations for partially coherent sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model to study multi-pion and multi-kaon Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) correlations for the partially coherent particle-emitting sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A density-dependent longitudinal coherent emission length and density-dependent transverse coherent emission length are introduced in calculating the multi-boson HBT correlation functions of the partially coherent sources. We compare the model results of three- and four-pion HBT correlation functions with experimental data in Pb-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV, and investigate the influences of boson coherent emissions on the multi-pion and multi-kaon correlation functions, respectively. We find that all of the three- and four-pion correlation functions of the partially coherent sources are consistent with experimental data. Coherent emission leads to the intercept decreases of the multi-boson correlation functions. The intercepts of the multi-kaon correlation functions of the partially coherent source are higher than those of the multi-pion correlation functions, because low kaon densities lead to smaller kaon coherent emission lengths than pion emission lengths. The intercepts of multi-boson correlation functions of partially coherent sources in high transverse momentum intervals are higher than those in low transverse momentum intervals because particle de Broglie wavelengths are small at high momenta.</description>

      <title>In-medium gluon radiation spectrum with all-order resummation of multiple scatterings in longitudinally evolving media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, there has been a sustained effort to systematically enhance our understanding of medium-induced emissions occurring in the quark-gluon plasma, driven by the ultimate goal of advancing our comprehension of jet quenching phenomena. To ensure meaningful comparisons between these new calculations and experimental data, it becomes crucial to model the interplay between the radiation process and the evolution of the medium parameters, typically described by a hydrodynamical simulation. This step presents particular challenges when dealing with calculations involving the resummation of multiple scatterings, which have been shown to be necessary for achieving an accurate description of the in-medium emission process. In this paper, we extend our numerical calculations of the fully-resummed gluon spectrum to account for longitudinally expanding media. This new implementation allows us to quantitatively assess the accuracy of previously proposed scaling laws that establish a correspondence between an expanding medium and a ``static equivalent''. Additionally, we show that such scaling laws yield significantly improved results when the static reference case is replaced by an expanding medium with the temperature following a simple power-law decay. Such correspondence will enable the application of numerical calculations of medium-induced energy loss in realistic evolving media for a broader range of phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity and Thermal Hall Effect in Dense Electron-Ion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$ or carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by the Righi--Leduc coefficient. The transition from a degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity. We provide also formulas fit to our numerical results, which can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations), In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>
