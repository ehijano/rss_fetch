      <title>Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Predictable Loss and Optimal Liquidity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant product markets with concentrated liquidity (CL) are the most popular type of automated market makers. In this paper, we characterise the continuous-time wealth dynamics of strategic LPs who dynamically adjust their range of liquidity provision in CL pools. Their wealth results from fee income, the value of their holdings in the pool, and rebalancing costs. Next, we derive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the width of the LP's liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the pool (provision fees minus gas fees), the predictable losses (PL) of the LP's position, and concentration risk. Concentration risk refers to the decrease in fee revenue if the marginal exchange rate (akin to the midprice in a limit order book) in the pool exits the LP's range of liquidity. When the drift in the marginal rate is stochastic, we show how to optimally skew the range of liquidity to increase fee revenue and profit from the expected changes in the marginal rate. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that, on average, LPs have traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample performance of our strategy is superior to the historical performance of LPs in the pool we consider.</description>

      <title>Convex ordering for stochastic control: the swing contracts case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate propagation of convexity and convex ordering on a typical stochastic optimal control problem, namely the pricing of \q{\emph{Take-or-Pay}} swing option, a financial derivative product commonly traded on energy markets. The dynamics of the underlying asset is modelled by an \emph{ARCH} model with convex coefficients. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying \emph{ARCH} coefficients. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein's formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the \emph{ARCH} coefficients can be relaxed with a semi-convexity assumption. To validate the results presented in this paper, we also conduct numerical illustrations.</description>
